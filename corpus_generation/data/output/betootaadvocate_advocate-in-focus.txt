Quieter Group Of High School Mates Announce Plans For Schoolies In Canberra

TEXT:

In light of the government’s has recent announcement that growing and processing marijuana for personal use in the Australian Capital Territory is legal, an announcement of another, quieter kind has occurred in a Betoota Quarry garage.   

Daniel Salmand (18) announced to his friends this afternoon that he’d finally found where the quiet group of bong-smoking skateboarders will ring in schoolies.  

“Fellas, I’ve got it.”   

The red-eyed youths’ glassy eyes were all transfixed on the prophet like Daniel.   

“Canberra” he proudly, yet unemotionally, announced.   

Much to the surprise of Daniel, but to no one else who’s ever seen a teenager 3 cones deep, his friends didn’t really react with the enthusiasm he thought they would.   

“You know, because weed’s legal there now!”   

“Ohhhhh, truuuuueeee, that’s doooopppeee” said one of the more coherent young adults.   

The remainder of the bong-heads smiled and nodded in agreement.   

“Should we punch another cone, bruh?”  

The sweetest question one will ever here.

“Sneakerhead” Coworker Surprises Office By Revealing He’s Also A Massive Wu-Tang Fan

TEXT:

During an after-hours work and self-loathing session, office worker Chris Guest (33) learnt something interesting about his new co-worker Liam King (27).

Since King started three weeks ago, Guest has learnt very little about him other than he likes to occasionally say ‘fo shizzle’ instead of ‘yes’ and that he sometimes appears to eat a whole rotisserie chicken for lunch.

One unmissable detail about the mystery colleague is his love for wearing man-sized children’s shoes that reflect his playful side at the expense of others failing to take him seriously.

“I’m a bit of a sneaker freak,” said the guy who’s actually more of a cocaine freak.

“Managed to snag these bad boys second hand. Good deal.”

As the colleagues worked for free in an effort that would go unrecognised by their senior leadership overlords, Guest asked if King would mind if he played a couple of tunes.

“You fuck with the Wu?” asked Guest as the Kung-Fu movie sample gave way to an iconic ‘90s artificial drum beat.

As it turned out, self-described sneaker freak Liam King did ‘fuck with’ the Wu-Tang Clan despite being reminded by the Staten Island-based rap group that they are best not to be fucked with.

“Oh sick, CREAM! Do you know this song?”

Over the sounds of the explicitly violent lyrics, the co-workers bonded about their love for all things that make them feel young while reminding their juniors how wise and superior they still are.

“Why have they never made a decent ninja turtles movie?”

Horse Girl From Primary School Now Into Burlesque

TEXT:

Stephanie Jacobson, known for being that mild attention seeker in primary school who used to gallop around the oval, is now into burlesque. 

With no discernible personality traits other than her seemingly large disposable income, Stephanie has reportedly moved on from horses and into the world of Victorian era caricature.

Under the stage name ‘Stella Mane‘ – Stephanie now spends her Thursday nights on stage at her local RSL and other venues that host performances from novelty hobbyists who like to over-intellectualise their chosen artform.

“I think people from school would be shocked to see how different I am now,” admits Stephanie, who hasn’t really surprised anyone by following a well-worn trajectory for rich white chicks.

“I’ve grown up a lot.”

Stephanie has fully embraced the art of burlesque, including cutting off her waist-length hair and dying it jet black. 

To complete her look, Stephanie now only wears clothes from Alannah Hill and Kitten D’Amour.

“I think people are pretty uneducated about burlesque. I mean sure, it can be a bit risquè but its got roots in cabaret. I hate it when people say its like stripping!” says Stephanie, as though dressing up like Nicole Kidman in Moulin Rouge and smoking fake cigarettes to rock opera is somehow more dignifying than making an actual income.

Despite this commitment to a brand new identity, Stephanie has had trouble making the transition from a sweet, wholesome girl, to sultry seductress.

“People still mention it,” says Stephanie, “I think they assume I’m this crazy horse girl but in reality, I’m really shy now!”

Stephanie does admit,
however, that there are some things she hasn’t been able to outgrow.

”Honestly I never learnt to run properly”

It is believed that as Stephanie enters the next phase of her young womanhood, she has also gotten into rockabilly, which meant leaving her house in Brisbane City to an apartment in Cleveland – a town famous for being the rockabilly central of QLD and as the place rich octogenarians go to die.

Adventure Tourism Industry Seeking Sky Diving Instructors Who Know How To Count Past Two

TEXT:

A leaked job application form for a local sky diving company has today revealed that applicants are only required to have the numeracy skills equivalent to that of a toddler. 

The application came across our desks early this morning and sent alarm bells ringing, how could someone who holds another human’s life in their hands only have to know how to count to two.  

Late 50s and slippery business owner, Jerry Guilaia, defends his hiring criteria, stating that they never get to 3 anyway – but admits it is probably worth finding some blokes that can at least get to three.

“It makes sense, I spose”

“We do got a rule here. Jump on two, that’ll do” 

“All these bucket list tickers get up there and chicken out, it’s a waste of fuel if we just fly them back down” 

“So, you do the old count to three trick. One, two, then push ‘em out!” said Jerry accompanied by a guttural laugh followed by a phlegmy coughing fit. 

It does seem that having any higher numeracy skills is a bit redundant in this particular instance, however we raised some concerns around the other scenarios where an employee might need to count higher than two, reading air pressure for example. 

“Hah! You just go by gut on that shit. It’s all guess work, mate.” 

“Yeah, I spose it’s a good look. Considers us officially hiring anyone who can count past two”

Following our interview with Jerry we looked up his business on TripAdvisor, Sky High Adventures has somehow managed to score negative stars – an incredibly alarming score, especially for a sky diving company.

Conveyer Belt Toaster Making Slightly Burnt Bread Look Like A Bigger Deal Than It Is

TEXT:

What would have been a perfectly adequate breakfast became a day destroying fiasco as a conveyor belt toaster let down a perfectly decent buffet breakfast.

The buffet breakfast offered at the heritage listed Betoota Baths Resort and Bingo Hall, was described to guests as ‘continental’ as if Australian’s give a fuck what Europeans get up to.

Unfortunately for the supermarket preserves provided, they were ultimately betrayed as the conveyor belt toaster failed to do the one thing it was manufactured for.

“Do I need to turn the heat up?” asked one desperate dinner, unsure of how they would spread hard little rectangles of butter on to cold bread.

“Christ.”

Considered a mechanical oddity by many, the conveyor belt toaster is found only at buffet breakfast situations as an alternative to having a couple of household toasters that are objectionably easier to use, move and effectively give uncooked bread an appealing crunch.  

For some the expectation-destroying buffet toaster is a mild inconvenience but to others it is a reminder that no matter how well planned and enticing the future may seem, forces beyond your control are capable of destroying your dreams leaving consequences in their dust.

“Might have to pop it in again.”

Biggest Grog Monster In Hometown Now Doing Relatively Good Job Of Raising A Kid

A west Betoota man who once shit on his own face has somehow managed to get his second child to kindergarten, it has been confirmed. 

In his youth, Barry Edwards held the Betoota Dolphins record for doing 27 hot shots in a row, but today he’s somehow got his life together. 

For those who grew up under a rock, a hotshot is when one takes a hit from a bong and then immediately chases that bong hit with a shot of pure alcohol – like a rum or vodka.

Barry’s fatherhood has left acquaintances of Barry’s thinking that maybe this whole parenthood thing isn’t that hard. 

“If Barry the bulldog can have 2 healthy kids and get them to school, I reckon anyone could do it,” said one acquaintance. 

The Advocate reached out to Barry to see how life was treating him as a young father. 

“Oh, it’s fucked, for starters they were both accidents – who the fuck thought I had any swimmers left?” 

“Everyone says they bring you so much joy, mine have just brought me nappies of shit and no sleep” 

“Guess the shit shouldn’t surprise me though [haha]”

Local Bloke Out On The Road For Work Treats All Of His Mates To A Phone Call About Nothing

Being on the road for work can be a lonely and thankless task, however one sales associate at the Betoota Training Institute has found a way to fill in his time and feel constantly in touch with his peers.

Brad ‘Beefy’ Burton’s system is simple, he just calls his mates, he explains to The Advocate over the phone while he drives between work sites.

“I just go to our group chat and call everyone in there”

“I used to go from top to bottom, but the boys would warn each other when I called the first name”

“So now I just choose randomly”

“I don’t necessarily have shit to say to them, but it’s better than sittin’ in silence”

“Oi, mind if I let you go? Got a few more of the boys to call.” Beefy said before abruptly cutting the interview short.

It’s believed Beefy’s friends are catching on to his random tactic as well, with some of the boys now just avoiding his phone calls all together.

“Fark, it’s alright sometimes, but I reckon I get about 5 phone calls a week from the bloke”

“Talk about boy who called wolf,” said a friend who wishes to remain anonymous.

At the time of press Beefy was up to his fifth phone call, none of which are answering.

New Blender At Grandparents House Points Towards Discovery Of Aldi’s Middle Aisle Of Dreams

TEXT:

A recent trip to a South Betoota retirement village has led Keith Walker to believe his grandparents have just discovered Aldi. 

At first, he thought his Gran had just gone mad and bought too many cans of baked beans, however after clocking a shiny new blender on the bench he knew it was Aldi.

“Usually their biccie offering is grim, couple of arrowroots and a scotch finger,” he said. 

“But this time there were about three different chocolate biscuits, liquorice, I think she even offered me some salami”

“Seeing the blender was a bit of a relief actually, as I could understand how it had all happened,” Keith told our reporter. 

Up until recently, Keith’s Grandparents had thought Aldi was a German conspiracy, a way for them to infiltrate our culture and bring it down from the inside out. 

But after hearing a few of the other residents sing Aldi’s praise they thought they’d give it a go.

According to Keith though, his Grandparents have to hide their love for Aldi from their immediate neighbour for fear of not being selected for Thursday bowling team.

“Old Murray next door hasn’t got over it, he won’t even eat chicken schnitzel.”

Despite their neighbour’s feelings towards Aldi, the Walker’s have no plans to stop shopping at the German supermarket – a position that Keith supports as he’s now less worried about them spending all his inheritance.

“Tip Your Courier” Says Tax-Dodging Multi-Billion Dollar Company

TEXT:

One of Betootacone Valley’s most successful tech start-ups is adding the option to tip their food couriers this week in an effort to make sure they’re paid properly.

Poonspoon started a number of years ago in a Betoota Heights garage. From its humble beginnings, it’s grown to be one of the most popular food delivery services in the Diamantina. It connects lazy degenerates with empty restaurants that offer cut-price food – a business model that’s proven to be a hit with local Millennials, most of whom just want this fucking expensive hell ride called life to be over as soon as possible.

Last financial year, Poonspoon reported to investors that the company generated close to $2bn in local revenue. Despite this, most of the profits went back to the company’s headquarters in Dublin and the Australian operation reported a net loss of $24 000.

Unfortunately, this is entirely legal. While Poonspoon continues to benefit and use our town’s infrastructure and facilities, the company does not pay a single cent to maintain it.

Which is part of the reason why Poonspoon is now asking local consumers to putty up the gap between what they pay their contracted employees and what’s required to live a basic lifestyle here in our cosmopolitan desert community.

Poonspoon‘s local operations manager spoke to The Advocate this morning, where he made the exciting announcement.

“Sometimes, the service is just too good not to tip,” said Mark Smith, the soulless husk of a human being who helps Poonspoon exploit his fellow man. 

“So we’ve added the option for our customers to tip their specialist direct delivery agent contractors! Yay! It also incentives our specialist direct delivery agent contractors to be nice and chipper when they get to the door!”

“At Poonspoon, we’re committed to bringing the people of Betoota the freshest and best-tasting foods from all the best restaurants around town! Here, use this code to get $10 off your next order! Take it!”

Our reporter backed out of the room, pressed the button for the lift then decided running down the fire escape would be the most prudent option.

Rosé Just Pulse For Grown-Ups

TEXT:

A new report by a leading industry body has found that the sloshy long-lunch staple of Rosé is just a more adult version of those highly-caffeinated alcopops you used to punish at high school parties.

A rosé is a type of wine that incorporates some of the colour from the grape skins, but not enough to qualify it as a red wine. It may be the oldest known type of wine, as it is the most straightforward to make with the skin contact method. Rosé wines can be made still, semi-sparkling or sparkling and with a wide range of sweetness levels. It is known for creating monsters out of everyday people, and is often viewed as a trigger for regrettable life choices.

In terms of the consumer demographic, rosé is most popular with young women who like filming Boomerang videos, and young men who have recently entered the two-to-three month relationship mark with young women who like filming Boomerang videos.

However, the findings in this recent report have finally provided the context needed to all of the chaotic things that happen after a bottle or two of this light red devil.

The new study, conducted by the Licensing Inquiries and Testing For Australian Management (LITFAM) ombudsman, has found that while Rosé drinkers may come across as mature and relatively in control of their lives – the drink is pretty much just the same as the PULSE or NRG mixers from yesteryear.

While not officially caffeinated, Rosé is just as effective at providing those that drink it with an unnecessary energy kick, similar to the response one’s body would have to those drinks that got banned back in the late 2000s.

“It’s basically Four Loko” said one researcher.

“It looks great paired with a linen shirt in the sunshine, but it causes so much shit”

Woman 3 Minutes Into Cooking Risotto Already Deeply Regretting Her Decision

TEXT:

After watching an episode of Chef’s Table, Alexandra Dash was inspired to venture into the culinary world of the Italian crowd pleaser, risotto. 

Despite her good intentions, she is tonight deeply regretting her decision to make the time-consuming rice dish a mere 3 minutes into cooking.

The Advocate reached out to Alexandra, who was more than happy to talk to someone while standing alone in her kitchen, constantly stirring and adding liquid to the risotto.

“I don’t know how this dish has survived for so long,” she said.

“It’s the most time-consuming thing ever.”

“It’s probably not even going to taste that good, fuck!”

It’s believed Ms. Dash is making a truffle and mushroom risotto after her and her partner, Phil, went truffle hunting at a farm on the outskirts of Betoota.

“You wouldn’t think Betoota would be good for truffles but it’s actually perfect” explained Tim Fungai, the truffle farm’s manager.

“There’s a small pocket out here that kind of has its own ecosystem, it really defies all we know about weather patterns”

At the time of press, Alexandra still had at least another 30 minutes of stirring to do. 

It’s believed the risotto will almost certainly not end up being worth the effort.

A Byron Bay woman, who makes her living analyzing people’s personality traits based on the stars, has had it with anti-vaxers and their unscientific claims. 

“I mean, the science is very clear — There is zero proof that vaccines cause autism,” Kendall, 24, from Byron Bay, told The Advocate. 

“If they even paused for a moment to think about it, they’d realize there is no hard evidence to support their claims.”

Kendall, a Virgo, went on to explain that because of her star-sign, she is particularly predisposed to have no tolerance for “Anti-vax bullshit.” 

“Virgos, especially those with cancer rising signs, like myself, aren’t very gullible,” she told reporters while she consulted her star chart. 

“We just have a very low tolerance for pseudo-science and false claims.”

Kendall, who has a Reiki and Astrology business in town, concluded by saying she was quite concerned about the lack of fact-based discussions happening in our society.

Folau believed that “the devil is trying to instil” homosexuality and gender fluidity into the world, and sounded a lot like an old Sky News boomer while panicking about “school kids being able to change their gender”.

But with the outrage beginning to lose momentum, it seems Folau had to ramp it up a notch this week and begin condemning fellow citizens to hell – based of their dietry requirements.

Deranged Man Thinks He Can Have A $10 Steak Special Cooked Any Other Way Than Medium

TEXT:

Local RSL diner James Liston (22) displayed some of his childlike naivety today by expecting his $10 steak special to be cooked any way other than medium.

Dropping by Betoota RSL for some weekend drinks in an environment without the constant fear of getting bashed, Liston eyed off the $10 steak special which was advertised eloquently next to a sign for a Schapelle Corby themed cover band.

“How do they make money selling a steak for ten bucks?” marvelled Liston as he polished off his fourth jar.

“Reckon I could switch the gravy for Diane?”

According to witness reports, when Liston ordered his steak, his request for it to be cooked rare was met with open laughter from bistro worker Sharni Davies (63). 

“Haha, righto mate,” laughed Davies as she handed Liston his buzzer.

“S’pose you want us to bring it to your table too? Haha, you fuckin’ kids.”

It wasn’t until Liston brought the steak to his table that he realised how his panglossian faith in pub food had lead to his downfall. 

Although Liston claims to have learnt everything he knows about steak from the movie Pulp Fiction, it didn’t take long for him to realise the rare steak he had ordered had been served medium like anyone with half a brain would have predicted.

“These chips needs some salt too. Far out, has this chef even been to culinary school?”

Lismore Woman Pushing The Envelope A Bit With The ‘I Live Just Outside Of Byron Thing’

It has been confirmed this morning that a young woman from the cosmopolitan regional centre that is Lismore is pulling the piss a little bit. 

Shawna Ashton, who grew up on the outskirts of the town aptly named ‘the Wok’ due to it’s geographical nature, has confirmed that she has been telling people not local to the region that she lives ‘just outside of Byron.’

Her actions follow new research released by the CSIRO this week revealing that 90% of residents who live within 100km’s of Little Bondi actually tell people that live ‘just outside of Byron.’

Aston confirmed to us that she does she herself pretty much as ‘a Byron girl’ considering she’s been to a few festivals there and went to the beach in Byron instead of Ballina at least 3 or 4 times in her childhood. 

“I used to love Byron so much more before it become a bit to commercialised you know,” Ashton said. 

“Back in the day it used to be a real hub for alternative people and dangerous ideas, but it’s sold out a bit now,” she said referring to the fact that people from Sydney and Brisbane who lack integrity and individuality have swamped the town in an effort to make themselves feel like they are a little bit different to the rest of the people in the high neworth suburbs they live in. 

“I’m also sort of a Nimbin girl as well really,” she explained referring to the fact that Nimbin is also within an hour’s drive of her share house in the part of town that floods every now and then.

“It’s been a tough couple of years getting certified at the Royal Betoota School Of Snake Oil, but it’s all worth it now that I am able to fleece people of their money by promising to provide abstract cures for things that they should probably just see a GP or a specialist about.”

Straight Edge Friend Rewarded For Chaufféuring Stoned Friends To Drive-Thru

A paramedics student, Crouch is part of the hardcore punk subculture known as straight edge, where adherents abstain from alcohol, tobacco and drug use.

While playing video games in their dorm common room, Crouch was rewarded for his temperance as his stoned mates asked him if he could please take them to drive through in exchange for for a free meal.

Initially, Crouch rejected the offer as he is vegan in addition to being straight edge but eventually gave in when they offered to get him a large chips and was told he could get first controller when they got back.

“I’m picking the music though,” stated Crouch as the four passengers crammed into his two door Hyundai Excel, with a red P-plate hardly distinguishable among the plethora of animal rights bumper stickers.

“Hope you like Minor Threat.”

Crouch proceeded to drive his stoned friends 15 minutes to the nearest drive-thru while their incessant giggling at signs and mailboxes was drowned out by the hardcore punk that would have rendered a police siren inaudible.

Upon arriving at drive-thru, Crouch suggested they order inside but the idea was shot down as the passengers claimed to be too stoned to talk to the staff.

“Can we pay separately? Here’s my card,” stated one red-eyed passenger holding out a student card.

“Ah! Haha, whoops!”

Returning to the dorm, Crouch was further rewarded for not indulging in drugs by being offered the chips that had fallen into the bag, as well as rights to any chips he found in his car the next day.

Returning Uni Student Recounts O-Week Tales Like She’s The First Person To Ever Pull A Cone

TEXT:

A third-year Liberal Arts major has swanned into the St Anthony’s College common room today with an air of unfounded arrogance about her. Felicity Ettelman then proceeded place herself amongst the first-year students, or as she calls them “fresher scum”.

“Guys, welcome to St Anthony’s, hopefully you can handle it [haha]” Felicity said to the eager freshmen.

“So, how was O-week?”

The freshers all looked at each other before one responded, “Uh, it was ok I guess. I think it was pretty tame compared to previous years.”

“Oh really? Did you have to do hotties?” she asked, clearly itching to share her own story about smashing hotties, or hot-shots as they’re more widely known.

“Umm I don’t think so, what are those?”

“OMG, you don’t know what a hot-shot is? That’s so cute!” Felicity patronised. She then launched into an explanation of a hot-shot, even though the majority of the freshers knew what a hot-shot was, they just didn’t call them ‘hotties’.

“Well, it’s when you smash a cone, that’s a bong, and then hold in the smoke, have a shot and then blow out the smoke”

“I used to do so many when I was a fresher, ahhh, I can’t believe you guys haven’t done them”

“I once did 5 in a row, I think it’s the college record or something”

What Felicity failed to mention to the freshers is that after doing the 5 hot-shots, she greened out and spent the next 10 hours crying and vomiting on the floor of the college showers.

It’s believed another student is going to tell the freshers how Felicity’s story really ended.

Sales Assistant Loads Up Customer’s Boyfriend With Items Worth Revisiting

TEXT:

An act of unwilling cross-sentient conversion took place today as sales assistant Maddie Gunn (30) transformed the boyfriend of a shopper into a clothes rack.

The couple who wish to remain anonymous, due to the boyfriend’s crippling insecurities of being seen in a women’s clothes shop, state that Gunn used persuasion and manipulation to coax the young woman into a change room, leaving her boyfriend responsible for holding 40 kilos of clothing that was kind of similar to some things she bought last week.

“Doesn’t she look great in that?” asked Gunn, checkmating him with a demon’s smile.

“I think she’ll look great in this one too don’t you? Can you just hold this for me doll?”

The boyfriend alleges that Gunn tried to continue the conversation while he was buckling under the weight garments his girlfriend might wear twice.

“She asked me what I do for a living,” stated the anonymous boyfriend turned clothes rack.

“I told her I work in insurance so like her I’m also used to stripping hardworking suckers of their hard earned dosh by appealing to their good nature.”

V Day Gift Hints Left Around Apartment Result In Day Late Woolies Flowers And Ferrero Rochers

TEXT:

Local woman Tinacity Willis couldn’t have been more obvious about what she wanted for Valentine’s Day if she tried. For the past fortnight, Tinacity has been leaving magazines open and tagging her boyfriend, Cameron, in social posts that clearly hint at what she’d like as a gift. 

However, she has today realised her tactics were all for nothing after her boyfriend showed up with a bunch of shit flowers and a box of Ferraro Rochers. 

“I’m allergic to nuts, so what am I going to do with these?”

“And these flowers still have a receipt stuffed in them, they were $8 and he bought them at 3:27pm today – so he’s just gone into Woollies on his way home”  

“I don’t know why I even bothered with all the hints” 

The Advocate reached out to Cameron for comment and to see just how the hell he screwed up this home run. 

“Shit, I didn’t know they were hints”

“I thought she tagged me in those necklace posts by accident”

“Her best mate’s name is Cas… so you can see where the mix up could have happened”

“It’s like I had a Stephen Bradbury moment, but I fucked it up.”

While Tinacity is ropeable about her dud Valentine’s Day, it is perhaps worth sparing a thought for all the single ladies out there who received nothing at all. After all, it’s better to spend the night eating a box of Italian chocolates with your partner than crying at home alone.

40-Year-Old Man With Nose Ring Got To See Koh Phangan Before All The Tourists

TEXT:

Local rocker of the bald patch and nose ring combo, Vince “Vinny” Garlin (40), is currently holding hostage a group of early-20s pub-goers in an escalating situation which has involved him telling them about ‘the real Koh Phangan.’

Witnesses state the situation started when Garlin overheard the group of young drinkers at the Betoota Tavern talking about a possible trip to Thailand.

Having never been asked for his opinion before, Garlin reportedly launched across the bar, sliding over the pool table and planting himself backwards in a chair to tell these young kids about his experiences backpacking through Southeast Asia in the 90s.

“Gather round softcocks,” stated Garlin, sitting so that everyone could see his tribal tattoos.

“You wanna hear about something real?”

Without further prompting, Garlin began talking about his experiences on the Thai island of Koh Phangan that he claims to have seen before it was ruined by ‘a bunch of tourists.’

“They’re just there to get their photos taken, they don’t care about the experience. So anyway, I had a mate who was smuggling gear across the border and he said…”

Garlin went on to continue about how ‘this generation’ is ‘fucked,’ citing examples of Millennial behaviour he has read about in a newspaper that was left behind at the only cafe in town he is not barred from entering.

“Don’t even get me started on what you guys are into. Think the Red Hot Chili Peppers are good? Fuck them! Anthony Keidis was ripping off Mike Patton, do you even know who that is? And not just Faith No More I’m talking Peeping Tom and Mr Bungle, not that they even teach you that at your fucking universities which won’t get you a job for the record, it’s a bloody scam mate, when I was your age I was working in the mines to pay for my one bedroom loft listening to the j back when it was double j, not what you guys are into, who are those pricks on there now, nearly threw my radio out the window the other day, more softcocks, did I mention it was called double j, did you know about that?”

Report Finds Rich People Far More Likely To Say Money Can’t Buy Happiness

TEXT:

A new report released by the World Happiness Organisation (WHO) has today revealed that money can in fact buy happiness and that the only people who disagree with the statement are already filthy rich.

Last June, WHO surveyed over 100,000 poor people and asked them one simple question, would you be happier if someone gave you a million dollars right now? 

The results came back with an astounding 99% of people saying yes, they would definitely be happier.

In a separate survey, WHO asked 100,000 rich people if they believed money can buy happiness and, unsurprisingly, the majority of people said no. 

What was interesting about the data from this survey was that of the people who said money can’t buy happiness, nearly all of them were born rich and had absent parents when they were growing up.

Boris Daller, a representative from WHO, explained to The Advocate that the purpose of this report wasn’t to tease poor people with the idea of money, but to prove that rich people are unhappy as a result of their environment, not because of money.

“Money didn’t make these people unhappy; upbringing, inherited mannerisms and a sense of entitlement made them unhappy.”

“Money can 100% buy happiness.”

Local Gambler One Big Multi Away From Buying Long Term Girlfriend A Ring

TEXT:

Damien (Damo) and his girlfriend, Caitlin, have been dating for nearly a decade, and as the pair are getting to the pointy end of their 30s there’s one glaring topic that’s on both their minds.

Marriage.

Unlike most other blokes in his position, Damo has a carefully mapped out a plan on how he’s going to afford to propose to his girlfriend and one true love. 

Our reporter happened to be on the scene with Damo as the first leg of that plan got up.

“I’m still live, go you good thing!”

“Only 3 legs to go.”

“If this multi gets up I’m buying Caitlin a ring, I don’t care what anybody says!”

Our reporter then stayed with Damo at the scene to follow the story as it developed, unfortunately for Damo, his dream of buying Caitlin a ring after the last race came crashing down on the fourth leg.

“Fuck.”

“I was so close!”

“I guess Caitlin’s just going to have to wait.”

After reaching out to Caitlin to see how she felt about Damo hinging their future on a multi that may never come, it was discovered that she wasn’t even aware that Damo had taken up recreational gambling again.

“He told me he would stop gambling to save for a ring. He’s doing the complete opposite.”

Our reporter thought it best not to mention to Caitlin that he had since placed another multi, following the failure of the first.

Domain.com.au Admit Safety Of Suburbs Is Determined By Amount Of Abandoned Trolleys Around

TEXT:

The latest safety report by real estate website Domain has been released today, outlining the safest suburbs for investors and owner-occupiers. 

While the suburbs on the list are not particularly surprising, the means by which they were determined is truly ground breaking.

The analysts at Domain have found a new indicator of safeness that’s allegedly ten times more accurate than reported crime rates; it’s the number of abandoned trolleys lining the streets and lying tipped over on front yards or in bodies of water. 

Head analyst, Jordan Leeming, explained to the press how he identified this new indicator and what exactly it means for certain suburbs.

“I was actually driving to pick up something I’d bought off Gumtree and I began noticing an increase in the amount of abandoned shopping trolleys,” he said.  

“It turned out that coincided precisely with the dodginess of the suburb I was passing through.” 

“The correlation jumped out at me, really.”

“It’s blown the lid off these supposed ‘safe’ suburbs. Just because there’s no break and enters reported doesn’t make it safe.”

“We’d previously believed Betoota Grove to be safe, but we now know it’s not. The same goes for Ashville, which is behind the train station.”

While the report has only been live for a number of hours, we can see it’s already having an effect on the local property market, with valuers knocking as much as 10 per cent off the price of some homes.

It’s believed this report coupled with the banking sector’s tightening of lending could make for some very interesting times in the market.

Recently Accepted Business Student Treats Herself To Country Road Duffle Bag

Sally Brent-Billings has splurged today on the back of receiving some good news. 

The 19-year-old living down south in the bohemian and vibrant nightlife hotspot that is the city of Sydney, did so after being informed that she had been accepted into a Business Degree. 

Brent-Billings who attended Betoota’s prestigious Royal Handmaid School For Girls said that she can almost taste the Friday afternoon rosé she’ll be drinking down in Martin Place or Betoota’s Old City District one day. 

“This is what I was born to do,” said the young woman to our reporters. 

“I mean, obviously I can work under my old man in his hedge fund firm if I wanted to, but the dream is cutting my teeth in London or the Big Apple after I finish uni.”

“Anyway, yeah, I got this overnight duffle bag as a treat to myself for getting into Business.” 

“It will serve me well over the years, and let people know what type of an operator I am when I start doing internships and all that.” 

Brent-Billings said she bought the bag at a fair price because she just got paid by her casual job that her parents told her she had to get to teach her the value of money while she lives in catered accommodation paid for by her parents. 

“Yeah dad made me get a job when I finished at UTS Insearch for the year, so I guess you could say I’ve been paying my own,” Brent-Billings laughed. 

“It will be perfect for carting my stuff around between uni classes, CrossFit, work and internships.” 

“I might take the bag next week for this Information Night they’ve asked me to speak at, to show everyone that you can get the Country Road bag one day too.”

“I’m so excited to get into it and start lecturing my mates at the pub about fiscal policy.

“I might even join the Young Liberals as well,” she laughed.

Federal Government Announces Emergency Deployment Of Cotton Farmers To Dry Out Townsville

TEXT:

The Federal Government has today announced a flood relief package, including hundreds of blue blood North NSW cotton farmers, to help with clean up efforts in Townsville

The news that flash flooding has once again hit Townsville and its surrounding towns has rattled the deep North overnight, as emergency crews work flat out to ferry people to higher ground.

“Heard they got 200 mils the Ville last night” said former Deputy Prime Minister, Barnaby Joyce.

“I’ve got some little panama-hat wearing cockies I can send up there to drain the whole town in a couple hours”

A new emergency alert, which went out at 12:30am this morning, warned residents in the town’s Northern suburbs that properties were at risk of flash flooding due to intense rainfall.

The unprecedented amount of rain in Townsville has caused the Ross River Dam to reach more than 200 per cent capacity, resulting in the immediate roll-out of young regional men usually associated with water theft in the Murray Darling river basin.

One fourth generation cotton farmer and noted Sydney uni drop-out Clyde Fontaine-Smithbone (22) says it’d be a shame to let all of this water go to waste.

“We can bring that Ross River dam down from 240% capacity to 100% without even breaching our water quotas” he said.

“Fuck the flood gates, just give me a length of poly and a Davey”

“This town will be as dry as the Dirranbandi motorcross track by sun down”

At time of press, Clyde and his second cousins Angus and Strath were seen drinking Fireball whiskey and doing cocaine ofd their iPhones on the front of an SES truck, while a number seasonal agriculture workers from Tonga rigged up the pump for them.

Greig Pickhaver Reflects On Life Being Both HG Nelson And Former Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett

If you’ve ever sat back on the couch and wondered why you’ve never seen former Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett and the unsinkable HG Nelson in the same room, think no more.

The comedian behind both of those timeless and much-loved characters has opened up today about a lifetime spent in the Victorian Parliament and the dizzy, exclusive heights of the Australian comedy scene.

Greig Pickhaver, a polite and happy-go-lucky South Australian septuagenarian, is the man who gave birth to these two iconic characters and he spoke briefly to The Advocate via telephone this afternoon where he reflected on his life that’s brought so much joy to so many people.

“You know, there’s a lot of HG Nelson in Jeff Kennett,” he said.

“And vice-versa. I was very privileged to be able to do what I’ve been able to do. Not every job lets you crush unions by day and make fun of Steven Bradbury’s barge arse by night,”

“There’s not a whole lot I’d do differently if I had my time again. Perhaps I wouldn’t have choked out Ted Baillieu that time with my bare thighs. I’m glad that one didn’t get out to the media at the time. We both laugh about it now but at the time, not as much.”

Greig Pickhaver’s full interview with The Advocate will be aired locally tomorrow at 12 pm on Desert Rock FM during the Betoota Advocate Radio Hour.

Moment Of Deep Introspection During Drive Home Brought On By The Cars “Drive”

TEXT:

A largely invisible and self-loathingly meek city worker said his drive home to Betoota Heights tonight was punctuated by The Cars’ 1984 classic ‘Drive’ which allowed him to have a moment of ‘deep introspection’.

It was in those 3 minutes and 54 seconds of genre-defining New Wave/Post-Punk that Derek Copeland was able to identify the many moments in his 44 years on this planet where he’d made the wrong decision and lived to regret it.

The softly-spoken Virgo spoke to our reporter via mobile phone from inside his salary-sacrificed Ford Mondeo as it ticked itself cool on the driveway of his rapidly depreciating display home.

“I got home and the song was only halfway through, so I did what any middle-aged man currently going through an existential crisis and I drove around the block until the song was over,” he said.

“You know what I mean?”

Our reporter did not.

Derek went on to explain that he’d just been overlooked for a promotion at work, which is something to do with a computer in an office in town somewhere.

Coupled with the fact he’s having Christmas with his wife’s family for the second year in a row, Copeland said he doesn’t have much to look forward to.

“But moments like the one I just described to you make me happy, in a way,”

Confronted by this glimpse into middle-age, our reporter hung up the phone and cut the landline with a steak knife left on the table from lunch.

Time-Rich Stefanovic Boys Turn Their Twin Beds Into A Bunk

One of those other opportunities, according to Peter, lies within the walls of the Eastern Sydney bolthole.

Speaking to the media this afternoon in Australia’s most overrated city, the 37-year-old Scorpio said he and his Karl had recently turned their twin beds into a bunk.

“We have a lot of time to do things now,” he explained while wearing one of his visually offensive train driver hats.

“So today, we got our beds and turned them into bunks so we’d have more room to smoke darts inside with the windows shut and the aircon on. The height of luxury. Only surpassed by having a dart in the Dead Sea. Seriously, let me know when you’ve tried it and try telling me you didn’t enjoy the experience,”

“Karl said he didn’t want to say anything today except for this short statement.”

Peter then unfolded a page seemingly torn from a 2003 edition of the Adelaide White Pages.

“Purple monkey dishwasher,” he declared.

“That’ll be all.”

Why Saying “Yeah Righto…” Followed By An Unflattering Lookalike Is The Ultimate Burn

TEXT:

There’s been a lot of talk about toxic masculinity lately.

In fact, as an opinion writer for an online news publication who grew up between two separate but extraordinarily well-off households (after my parent’s divorce, yeah, it sucked) and went to a prestigious strict single-sex private school, Toxic Masculinity seems to be all I can ever write about.

It’s everywhere.

From the Australian ball-tampering scandal to African-American hip-hop music, toxic masculinity has infiltrated every different part of my life. And it needs to be called out.

“Banter” – yeah, I was never a fan of it. When I was exposed to it, anyway. To me, it’s just a mechanism used by sportsball morons to uphold their precious white patriarchal stranglehold on society, and simultaneously mask their feelings with the stoic curtain of light-hearted humour.

But, love it or hate it. Christmas is coming up and no doubt we are going to have to be exposed to banter. Whether it’s from your uncle that won’t stop talking about how your new haircut is a bit how ya going, to your 65-year-old boss who you are forced to engage with despite the fact you resent everything he stands for but are too cowardly to address it.

Banter is an epidemic in Australia, and quite often when caught up in it, there is no way out.

That’s what I thought, that was until I heard to tradies bantering while working on a neighbours driveway the other morning outside my mother’s house.

That’s when I learnt the ‘yeah righto…’ call. Which if used correctly can quickly shut down any form of IRL trolling.

Basically what it is, is a gloriously petty way to establish yourself momentarily as the alpha of the circle by associating your opponent with an obscure and ultimately embarrassing doppelganger.

The tradie I saw get burned had big locks of curly red hair, and his colleague referred to him as “fat sideshow bob” it was not only very funny, but also a savage blow. The other blue-collar workers standing around were breathless with laughter.

And it worked for me too yesterday, when I finally worked up the courage to call a loud colleague ‘skinny bill shorten.’ I even said ‘yeah righto’ at the start. My boss laughed, and so did several other executives too. It worked a treat.

And it can work for you too.

Social Media Manager Stresses Over Report No One Will Read

TEXT:

It was a busy first week of the month for social media manager Lizzy Dowling (28) who spent a continuous 96-hour stretch stressing out over a report no one will read.

With a degree in Communications worth slightly less than the paper it is printed on (plus a debt that will last until her 50s) Dowling fell into a career in social media, being highly qualified to do something 3 billion people participate in weekly.

Alongside forcing her brand into current memes and handling complaints from joint boomer accounts, Dowling is also responsible for creating monthly social media reports that contain terms like ‘impressions,’ ‘average daily sentiment’ and many others that are only slightly better to hear than an electric drill directly into the eardrum.

Rushing to complete the report, Dowling was forced to compile 25 pie charts, 18 line graphs and 118 screenshots of dissatisfied customers into a power point presentation that would literally be read only by her.

“How do I put a positive spin on this?” asked Dowling as she stared at a comment of from a user who said they would never be buying her companies tissues again after their nose fell off.

“I don’t want to anger the relevant stakeholders.”

Taking time during the evenings and weekend, Dowling finally managed to finish the comprehensive report and sent it out to go sit stagnantly in the inbox of 29 team members.

Company CEO Gordon Comstock (66) stated he never reads the reports after taking one look at them and failing to understand what engagement was and why in the great world of fuck he should give a shit.

“We’re a tissue company. I don’t get why we’re on social media. People buy our product to discharge their bodily fluids into,” said the CEO.

“Actually, maybe that’s why we are on social media.”

Local Woman Just Not Pulling Off The AirPods

TEXT:

In a bid to modernise her look, Betoota Cove woman, Jacinta Fraser (27), last week paid $230 AUD for a pair of Apple AirPods.

However, the reception from her friendship circle and work colleagues is a fair indicator that her brand upgrade just isn’t working.

According to one friend, Jacinta just looks like a massive spoon.

“I don’t know what she was thinking, they look terrible. It’s like she’s taped white golf tees to her head.”

Reviews from co-workers followed in a similar vein.

“She walks around the office all day wearing them, I’ve never seen her wear headphones in her life now all of a sudden these AirPods are essential to her being.”

“If she looked cool it’d be different, but she looks lame, she barely uses the AirPods – I swear she’s just wearing them for the sake of it.”

The Advocate reached out to Jacinta for comment, however, we had some difficulty conducting our phone interview with her due to the connection issues caused by her trying to talk to our reporter through the AirPods.

What we did extract though was an overwhelming tone of regret.

“Yeah, I’m just not pulling them off,” she said.

“I was in Japan recently and everyone here had them and looked really cool.”

“But I look shit. It was such an impulse buy.”

The Advocate understands Jacinta is experiencing what is commonly known as Buyer’s Remorse, an overwhelming feeling of regret after purchasing any product over $150.00.

Despite knowing she looks lame and has bought an inferior product, Jacinta is firmly sticking to her guns when it comes to the AirPods.

“Yeah, well I don’t have much of a choice. I’ve just got to own it.”

Morrison Sports Von Dutch Trucker Hat In Latest Attempt To Distract Nation

The Prime Minister was seen wearing a Von Dutch trucker hat this morning in Canberra as he looks to distract the nation from the dubious anti-encryption laws that both he and Bill Shorten passed earlier this week.

In addition to that, Scott Morrison’s government is set to be the first government in almost 90 years to have legislation knocked back on the floor of the House.

Speaking to the media this morning in Canberra, our Prime Minister said he didn’t want to talk about work, he wanted to talk about his new hat.

“It’s actually vintage,” he said, laughing.

“Yeah yeah, I know how popular these were back in the day. Wyatt Roy even emailed me and said I was a ‘gronk’ – whatever that means! I’m just trying to get on with the job of running the country,”

“Where did I get it? Oh, I just had it lying around at home! Must belong to one of the kids or something? Maybe a nephew? I don’t know. It’s not about the hat. It’s about being sun smart.”

Interestingly, the CSIRO confirmed in 2016 that Wyatt Roy is actually a ‘massive gronk’ along with anybody under 30 who is that politically motivated.

Morrison then called an end to the presser and told reporters they should be grateful.

He didn’t indicate what they should be grateful for, however.

Man Unfit To Operate Barbecue Posts Picture With Baby Niece

TEXT:

A small town social media bubble has been swept with an eerie silence today as social media user Darren Noble (32) uploaded a picture of himself holding his baby, niece despite the fact he cannot even be trusted to operate a barbecue.

Despite holding down a job as a full-time drummer, Noble has somewhat of a reputation in his community for being a clown’s clown and is the only person to date in Australia to be charged for attempting to drive using his scrotum.

“Aw yeah that was funny as fuck,” laughed Noble, who for public safety reasons we must repeat, really shouldn’t be allowed near infants.

“Nut drives! Yeeeew!”

Thankfully, having not reproduced himself, Noble has limited experience around newborns, which makes it all the more troubling that his sister Sharon would allow her firstborn child to be held in the hands of a man who once tried to grubber kick a kebab.

“He’s excited to be an uncle,” stated Sharon.

“I haven’t seen him this happy since he got all four limbs taken out of a cast on the same day.”

At the time of writing, Noble states he is hosting a sausage sizzle for his new baby niece, as soon as he can figure out how to connect a gas canister to his BBQ that he has put off cleaning for the past 12 years.

Orange Juice Wages War On Freshly Brushed Teeth

TEXT:

The United Nations is under pressure to officially condemn orange juice after the fruit beverage launched a vicious attack on a set of freshly brushed teeth.

In the developing situation, incompetent university student Jamie Dwyer (19) received a brutal strike attack to his freshly brushed teeth after swigging a mouthful of orange juice directly from a bottle that did not belong to him.

At first, young Dwyer mistook the attack as an anti-theft measure from whichever housemate buys the orange juice he helps himself to only a daily basis but learnt it was due to sipping the citrus juice shortly after brushing his teeth, a thing he has never done before.

“This is why I don’t brush my teeth in the morning,” stated the irate Dwyer at a candlelight vigil in support of the attack victims.

“I may never wash my teeth again. What does orange juice have to say for itself?”

Prime Minister Scott Morrison has made a statement asking leaders of the citrus community to come forward and report all suspicious behaviour to stop attacks like this.

He has also advised dopey uni students like Jamie Dwyer to not drink orange juice after brushing your teeth because for fuck’s sake it’s not that hard to remember and no one really needs to drink orange juice after you turn 12.

Silly Season Kicks Off As Cheryl From Accounts Declares Self ‘Lit’ In Potential HR Disaster

TEXT:

It’s official, the silly season is here!

The declaration was made moments ago at a popular bar in Betoota’s Old City District, by a 40-year-old mother of two named Cheryl.

Cheryl Harrigan officially kicked off the festive season this evening when she informed her colleagues that she was ‘lit.’

With her husband out of town for a golf weekend and her kids at her mothers, Cheryl decided to let her hair down a little bit for the customary after work Friday drinks.

Knocking over a couple of beers and a bubbly, Cheryl declared herself ‘lit’ in a sign that her fellow employees should potentially be on notice.

“When the hubby’s away, the girl will play. I’m liiiiiiit (sic),” laughed Cheryl to her colleagues.

“Lets have fun tonight!”

The bold declaration was lost on a few of her colleagues powering through the happy hour drinks.

However, it wasn’t lost on fellow office worker Alecia Hardwick.

“This is a HR disaster in the making,” explained Hardwick.

“Because of Cheryl’s general obligations, she doesn’t drink that often, and when she does, she tends to let rip as you can imagine.”

“A couple of Christmas party’s ago she was very lucky she didn’t land herself in hot water with HR, and declaring herself ‘lit’ this early in the afternoon tends to indicate she could be on a tear.”

“Looks like it’s safe to say the silly season is here.”

TEXT:

Fresh from being denied a chance to have his cricketing ban shortened or perhaps even liften, former Test captain Steve ‘Smudge’ Smith has told journalists outside his Sydney home that he’s already beaten India this summer anyway and Cricket Australia can suck on that.

“I’m not telling them how I did it, either,” said Smith.

“It’s pretty simple if you use the right tactics, rest people when you should. Also, not playing silly strokes. Test cricket isn’t a race guys, it goes for five days usually. Well, it can but sometimes it doesn’t,”

“So yeah. I reckon they probably should’ve let me play because now I’ve got the secrets to victory. But guess what, I’m not telling anybody so go suck a fat one, Cricket Australia.”

Smith, who famously calms his nerves before going into bat with his beloved Nintendo Switch, said that he understands that the video game Indian team is different to what they are in real life – but they’re strengths and weaknesses are largely the same.

Before heading back inside to play Red Dead Redemption 2, the 29-year-old wrist-spinner said Shane Warne did the same thing he did when he copped a 12-month doping ban.

“Shane used to play Shane Warne Cricket 99 when he was out injured and banned. He swears by it,”

“And if it’s good enough for Shane, it’s good enough for this man of the Shire. No dis Frodo! [laughs]”

Senate Told They’ll Have To Wait Until Council Cleanup In May To Dispose Of Their Toxic Garbage

TEXT:

Federal Senators have been told they’ll have to wait until the May council cleanup in Canberra next year to get rid of the toxic garbage that’s preventing them from serving the public in an appropriate manner.

The news was met with sighs across the chamber.

One of the loudest being Greens leader Richard Di Natale, who said the amount of clutter and garbage that occupies a number of Senate seat space is a concern.

The Victorian took time out of his busy morning of being in time out to speak to our reporters via telephone.

“It’s disappointing that we’re going to have to wait until the council pick up in May to really clean the house,” he said.

“But I’m glad that we’re doing it in an environmentally-friendly and thoughtful manner. That we’re not just going to drive out into Tidbinbilla and throw it in a creek. I’m not a pig,”

“But there’s plenty of people in the chamber who would do that. I’m not going to name names, but it rhymes with Harry O’Cuntivan. Anyway, have a good one guys. I’m going to play handball and eat devon sandwiches with Katter now.”

Selfish, Self-Centred And Rain-Delayed Sydney Commuters Urged To Consider The Farmers

TEXT:

Stressed, late for work and her favourite reality television amateur chef got eliminated last night.

Margot Flower is pissed off.

The bubbly Sydneysider’s commute to work this morning has been ruined because of the record-breaking rain that the hell hole is currently experiencing.

However, upon her arrival to work, her grievances with the weather were quickly shot down by the NSW Premier who was on the flatscreen in the lobby of her office block.

“Do not complain about this fucking rain, you self-centred fuckwits,” said Gladys Berejiklian.

“Think about the farmers out west who’ve just got their first big rain in years. Think about them, about how happy they’d be right now. Finally. And you cunts have the gall to complain and whinge about your train being late,”

“Go and get fucked. You live in one of the safest, most developed and beautiful cities in the world and all I fucking hear is whinge, whinge FUCKING whinge from you fucks! Just fuck right off, would you? My job is hard enough as it is without you narcissistic gronks complaining about the weather. Fucking deal with it!”

The Premier then flipped off the reporters present at the Macquarie Street presser and went back inside Parliament.

Speaking to The Advocate a short time ago, Margot said that dressing down that she and the millions of other rats in that six-horse brothel town got from the Premier was unexpected.

“She’s right,” Margot told our reporters.

“We must not complain about the weather because of the farmers. The farmers need the rain – and the rain is here. It’d be good for the dams. We need water in the dams,”

“And if that means I’m inconvenienced by rain once or twice a month, then I’m OK with that. Thank you Gladys Berejiklian for putting it all in perspective for me.”

The rain continues in Sydney while the rest of the country – and the world revolves around it.

Monday Night’s Air Of Decorum Shattered By Suburban Patriarch Yelling At Tony Jones

TEXT:

“You bias prick!” he yelled as family in the next room jumped.

The unsinkable Tony Jones had just rolled his eyes at Tasmanian senator Eric Abetz and cut him off with a black-handed and ultimately condescending remark – rather than let him voice his opinion.

“What a fucking wanker! Karen! Get in here! Get a load of this fucking bedwetter! He’s such a fucking bias prick, no wonder no cunt wants to go on his show.”

Karen was cutting up cucumber in the kitchen for the prepackaged lasagne’s side salad. She didn’t respond.

But the air of decorum and gum-shaded paradise was shattered by Ralph Bereman last night at 45 Heinze Link Road in Betoota Heights.

It was shattered because Tony had upset Ralph once again.

Speaking this morning to The Advocate at the Betoota Heights Dog Wash, Karen Beremen said she doesn’t know why her husband watches Q&A every Monday if it works him up so much.

“It is biased and anybody who says it isn’t has rocks in their head,” she said.

“But everybody knows that. Old Autofelatio Jones saying the show isn’t biased is like Eric Abetz saying he didn’t know about the plan to shaft Turnbull. They’re both lying, over-paid public servants who ultimately would be living in a bus shelter if it wasn’t for public money,”

“But it does make for compelling television, though.”

Mature Age Online Student Devastated By Inability To Interrupt Lecturer Mid Sentence

TEXT:

A 48-year-old law student from Betoota Grove was left shouting at his computer today.

The empty nester who saw his last child head out the door of his 5 bedroom sandstone house in Betoota’s leafy grove, was driven near to tears by what occurred while he was trying to study online.

David Holt, a semi-retired accountant told us that he decided to take up study after his kids left as something to do.

“I was getting a little restless with the kids gone, so I decided to dip my toe into ‘the law’ if you will,” he said.

“And it was very convenient for me, being able to study online with CQUniversity,” said Holt.

“However, there was one thing that I didn’t take into account. The whole reason that mature age uni students go to uni in the first place. To impart wisdom upon the teaching staff and next generation.”

Holt explained that he received the shock of his life upon starting his first-class online.

“I nonchalantly raised an interesting point about the workforce and how a scenario I once dealt with was relevant to a certain aspect of tort law and the lecturer didn’t even stop for a second,” he said.

“So I raised my point again, and threw a disparaging remark about people without real-world experience in as well, and, again, he didn’t stop.”

“I then informed the lecturer that I don’t take well to being ignored and I that I signed up with CQUniversity because I thought it was a more informal and collaborative learning process.”

“Then I just began shouting.”

The Rugby fan then explained it was at that point that he realised that he couldn’t physically interrupt the lecturer mid-sentence.

“What’s the point then hey? I have a whole lifetime of experience at my accounting firm, and these young kids should be obliged to listen to my lessons on life because I’m bored and have begun studying to pass the time,” he said.

This Monday’s Existential Crisis Made Worse By The Fact It’s Almost December

TEXT:

As the D45 bus from the French Quarter meandered its way through Betoota Heights and down to the Old City like the pathetic River Torres, a local city worker looked out the window at the trees and people flashing by and wondered when her ship would come in.

Sam Spears, who does something in an office with a computer for a giant multinational that ultimately sees her as a dispensable commodity, also wondered if the contents of that ship will justify the effort it takes to make one’s ship come in.

She recounted her thoughts to our reporter this afternoon in the smoking pokies at the Betoota Dolphins Leagues Club.

“I can’t believe it’s almost December, what the fuck am I doing with my life?” thought the popular but ultimately directionless 29-year-old.

“What even is my job? Does it contribute to society in anyw ay? Or am I just making my bosses richer? Maybe I should quit everything and move somewhere new,”

“Where I can continue to feel like this as the big 30 comes around. But I haven’t got any money to do that. I need help. Or do I? Maybe I’ve just got a bad case of the Mondays. I did go pretty hard. I just don’t get it.”

Sam then put her cigarette out on Pelican Pete’s face and went back into the bar.

Liberals Reportedly ‘Furious’ At Jesus For Answering Prayers Of Labor Party In Victoria

TEXT:

Popular secular figure Jesus Christ has told reporters this morning that he’s fielded many ‘foul-mouthed’ and ‘mean-spirited’ phone calls from Liberal Party members today in the wake of the Victorian election.

Mr Christ, who took time out of his busy morning of eating party pies in a hammock to speak to The Advocate, said that the Liberals are accusing him of answering their prayers of the Labor Party instead of theirs.

“Phillip Ruddock called me a ‘pinko cocksucker’, then hung up on me,” he said.

“So strange. We used to be good mates. Then all of a sudden, they’re all off me. Even Malcolm rang me, which he never does, and we had a good chat about things. Kayaking and bull sharks mostly. I said he wasn’t going to be eaten by one, he need not worry, I have another plan for him,”

“Bill rang too. But yeah. Not much to talk about. He tried to talk sports but we both knew it was pointless. Oh wait, ScoMo is calling. I’ll ring you back after.”

The Liberal Party has yet to respond to requests for comment on Mr Christ’s sentiments.

Dad’s Frequent Mailbox Runs A Decent Sign He’s Been Nabbed By A Speed Camera Again

TEXT:

Eyebrows have been raised in Betoota Heights as father of three Rodney McKinnon (62) went out of his way to check the letterbox, which for his family is a sure sign he’s been nabbed by a speed camera.

McKinnon’s family is aware the patriarch occasionally speeds, although it appears that none of the time he saved by speeding has gone towards doing housework and the fact that he checked the mail himself means he is surely trying to hide something.

“Just bills. Good. Great,” stated McKinnon as he wiped his sweaty brow with an eco-friendly Wildlife Fund mail-out.

“Good old bills.”

Wife of 17 years Courtney McKinnon (58) states her husband Rodney has been uncharacteristically militant about checking the mail in recent weeks and is torn between confronting him about it or using similar tactics to get him to mow the lawn.

“The only time that he took the bins out was when he threw the vege lasagne in the bin and told me he’d eaten it, when he’d really ordered takeaway,” stated Courtney McKinnon.

“The look in his eyes when I found a chip in the couch later that night is no different to the look in his eyes now. Nice to not have to worry about the mail though.”

Rodney McKinnon denies that there are any ulterior motives behind his militant letterbox regime stating simply that he just really cares about mail right now.

“What is weird about a man deciding the check the post seven days a week?”

Following his statements, McKinnon was seen swearing as he opened a blank envelope addressed to him which turned out to be from a charity he donated to eight years ago.

“You beauty!”

Big Weekend: Local Tradie Hires Labourer For The Day So He’s Not Alone

TEXT:

Jim Walters of JW Constructions, whose company claims to be the builder of dreams, is building anything but that today as he and his labourer sit at their work site in silence, just calcified shells of the people they once were.

It’s understood that Jim hired his labourer, Robbo, to work alongside him for 8hrs purely so he didn’t have to be alone.

“Yeah…I, ah, don’t even have anything for him to do” Jim managed to get out while staring off into the distance.

While Jim is usually quite the go-getter, after 4 back to back weekends hammering piss and haemorrhaging cash at the spring carnival, the only thing he’s managed to do today is instructed the young bloke to go and get him some smoko – and he didn’t even get that right.

“I don’t know what I was thinking, I said I wanted a cheese and bacon pie and a strawberry milk.”

“Every bite is a reminder of how shit I feel.”

According to thelabourer though, things aren’t so bad.

“Usually he’s a pretty hard taskmaster, so getting paid to just keep him company is fine by me.”

If Jim was looking for some kind of relief from his social life or at least drinking, it doesn’t look like he’s going to get it.

The Advocate can confirm that JW Constructions has just been awarded a job in partnership with his cousin’s building company and according to all reports, Jim’s cousin loves a bit of piss too.

Property Agent Impressed By Well-Hidden Bongs On House Inspection

TEXT:

While inspecting a rental property in the ruff n’ ragged Betoota Ponds district, property agent Billy ‘Bulldog’ Hodgson noted how incredibly impressed he was by the well-hidden bongs in the dilapidated fibro shack.

Waiting until he was invited in before entering, Bulldog began following his nose, ignoring the Blue Tac on the walls and innumerably stained carpet, looking for a smoking bong that would see his agency pocket the bond almost half of the tenants have gone in for.

Although a seasoned veteran when it comes to finding damning paraphernalia that will legally screw over the working class, Billy Bulldog’s bong-scan of the rental property failed to turn up even one blackened paper clip.

“This is great,” stated Hodgson.

“I actually have no idea where the bongs are this time. Last tenants just left them on the kitchen counter. This is a real challenge.”

Determined to find any sign of illegal activity, Bulldog stepped into the backyard to examine the hosepipe which he then remembered was hacked to the tap by the previous tenants.

Finishing his job, Bulldog jotted down the roughly 50 maintenance requests on the back of a receipt he accidentally left on the kitchen counter and left after quickly checking the recycling bin for tainted Orchy bottles.

“Wow. They got me. I’m honestly impressed.”

Odd Assortment Of Stolen Pub Glassware Fair Indication He’s Not Ready To Settle Down Yet

TEXT:

A local girl has had her suspicions confirmed this evening after opening up the glasses cupboard in her fling’s kitchen and seeing a hodgepodge collection of stolen pub glasses. 

“I knew in that moment that Jez wasn’t ready for a girlfriend” sighed Melanie Kryger (29). 

Melanie had been eager to ask Jez where he saw their fling going, however the lack of matching glassware was a clear indication that he wasn’t ready to give up on his baching phase just yet. 

“No mature man still has schooners as functioning glasses, I mean I’d get it if he was in a share house and 22”

“But he’s 31! A) he’s still stealing them or b) he stole them when he was younger and has taken them with him everywhere he’s moved” 

“Either way, it’s not a good sign.” Said Melanie.

The Advocate reached out to Jez for comment and to see if Melanie’s schooner test is accurate. 

“Haha yeah I love my pub glassware, I try steal some at every pub I go to”

“It’s cheaper than buying anything, plus matching glasses are for chicks”

Our reporter pushed for more information on Jez’s feelings towards Melanie. 

“Oh yeah Mel’s a good bird, just a bit of fun hey”

“It’s not too serious though, summer’s coming and so I don’t want any baggage, you know.” 

It appears that Melanie’s schooner test was completely accurate, Jez’s bachelor pad looks to remain that way for some time.

Villain Looks Menacingly Into Security Camera To Assert Authority

TEXT:

Fear was struck into the hearts of honest men everywhere today as notorious underworld figure Dr Badman stared menacingly into the lens of a security camera to assert authority and terrifying those who were watching.

After allowing himself to be taken into custody, Dr Badman was brought in for interrogation where it soon became aware that despite being chained to the table, he was still the one in control.

“There is a plan for everyone Detective Lucius,” stated Dr Badman as he drilled his pupils deep into interrogation room security camera, causing those watching the footage to sit in a puddle of their own making.

“And God’s plan awaits us all.”

While it is believed that Dr Badman has intimidated his last camera, some are speculating that the maniacal genius may have actually allowed himself to get captured in order to get closer to those who believe themselves more righteous and deliver justice in a way most violent and cruel.

At the time of writing, it is believed that Dr Badman is in the back of an armoured car, entertaining the two SWAT guards with a long monologue about a horrible war crime he witnessed and how he found his moral compass through committing series of wrong doings from a young age.

Reports that the motorcade was attacked, killing the SWAT team but leaving Dr Badman unharmed and able to escape are yet to be confirmed.

Local Woman Asserts Status In Group By Asking To Sample House Rosé

TEXT:

Ally Williams has impressed her friends this afternoon by pulling off a play at the bar.

Enjoying a couple of ‘cheeky ones’ on a Friday evening after work with a few of her girlfriends, the group decided it was best to make the most of happy hour.

After quickly navigating their way through a couple of cocktails, the group tentatively settled on some rosé at a pub in Betoota’s Old City District.

Moving up to the bar in a group to try and figure out what they might pick rather than just sending someone to relay back some drinks, Williams decided to play her role as the decision maker and leader in the group.

She did so by asking the under the pump waiter to let the girls sample the house rosé in a bold power play on the stroke of happy hour winding up.

One of Williams friends named Ashleigh Gillies told The Advocate that it’s a move Ally’s pulled before.

“She’s the decision maker,” laughed Gullies.

“Most of our group are pretty go with the flow kind, avoid any type of conflict types of people, but Ally doesn’t mind the old big dick energy play when she feels like it.”

Gillies explained that today was the perfect example.

“Bar tender under the pump, people wanting to be served before the sledgehammer of six clock slams down, and Ally decides to sample the house rosé.”

“And who even rejects a drink after sampling it anyway. Apart from complete snobs. Good on her for the confidence to pull off the move though, the bartender actually loved her confidence.”

Stingy Father Of The Bride Really Pushing For A Church Venue

TEXT:

Two families have sat down today to discuss the financials of their respective children’s upcoming wedding. It’s understood that conversation between the bride’s parents, Mr and Mrs Corry, and the groom’s, Mr and Mrs Mendez, got off to a good start. However, as soon as push came to shove things got a little awkward.

“Yeah, so I know the kids really wanted to have the wedding at the grounds of Betoota Estate, but I don’t know about that.”

“Surely they’d want something more unique and memorable,” said Mr Corry, seemingly with an ulterior motive.

At this point Mrs Mendez piped up in defence of the young love birds.

“Are you sure? I’ve heard them both talk about how much they’d love to get married out there.”

“They’re so young,” said Mr Corry, “they don’t really know what they want”

“Looking back, I’m sure they’d prefer a simple venue, like a church.”

The next comment from Mr Mendez really hit a nerve with Mr Corry, causing him to become quite defensive.

“Mate, if it’s the money that’s worrying you, we’re more than happy to help out,” said Mr Mendez.

“What? Money? No that’s not it at all, I just reckon they’d prefer to get married in a church, you know, the old-fashioned way.”

Speaking to the groom’s parents after the sit-down, they seemed fairly certain that Mr Corry was pushing for a church venue because it was the cheaper option.

“I don’t know why he’s trying to deny it,” Mr Mendez finished.

ScoMo Announces Controversial Buy-Back Scheme For Deadly Bunnings Onions

TEXT:

The Prime Minister has this afternoon stepped in to quell the hysteria surrounding caramelised onions at Bunnings warehouses today by announcing a $2bn package to ‘buy-back’ the deadly vegetable before somebody dies.

Speaking to the media today from Singapore, Scott Morrison explained that action needed to be taken and that action has now been taken.

He fronted cameras a short time ago with bits of lunch down the front of his shirt and a goofy, happy-go-lucky timbre to his voice.

“Enough is enough,” he said, sheepishly.

“I’m not going to let somebody die on my watch. Not now, not ever. People are not allowed to die anymore. And what a way to die? Slipping back with a nick nack paddywack on the back of your skull! Like in the Man from Snowy River!”

The Prime Minister briefly imitated what witnesses describe as a ‘whip-cracking’ motion.

“Whooopish! Only then to flip-flop around indignantly on the footpath beside the sauso-sizzle-blizzle and seize up like a carp on a riverbank while all the ladies scream and Bunnings folk rush to cover your writhing corpse up with a tarp! What a way to go! I’m making sure no Australian has to go through that!”

When asked when the proposed buy-back scheme would start, ScoMo smirked and shrugged.

“Don’t shoot me, I’m only the messenger!” he said.

“I just don’t understand how we can’t get drumlines going off the Queensland coast, nets on every beach and a yearly cull happening.”

“All the lefties going on about conservation and all that need to have a good hard look at themselves. We need to make our beaches safe,” said the man whose last dip in the ocean was at the Sunshine Coast January of last year.

“It’s a national disgrace.”

From the comfort of his Matt Blatt sofa within the confines of his palatial Mooney Ponds compound, Bill Shorten looked on as two of the nation’s most overpaid and underworked public servants used our public broadcaster as a vehicle to sling mud at each other.

Grown Man With New Laser Pointer Has Weekend Plans Sorted

Grown man Curtis Dyson (33) officially has his weekend plans sorted after purchasing a new laser pointer.

Stopping at his local two-dollar shop to inhale the smell of cheap plastic that makes all cheapy-shops smell the same, Dyson purchased a laser pointer that for only $3.95 opened up a world of opportunities for a weekend he was probably going to spend doing things adults usually do.

“I thought these things were illegal!” stated Dyson, not noticing the store owner selling spray paint to a group of 12-year-olds.

“This is going to be good!”

For Dyson, Saturday night cannot come soon enough, as once it is dark he will be able to fully experience the comprehensive range of the laser pointer that he plans to aim at other buildings from the apartment he rents using money from his grown-up job.

As of the time of writing, Dyson plans to point the cheapy-shop laser into other people’s homes, his own mirror and possibly onto the screen at in a movie theatre as if it it is the ‘90s and he is 10 years old once again.

“Probably shouldn’t point it at a plane though. Reckon it could get it? I shouldn’t do it. I reckon I could though.”

Dad Validates The Existence Of Liquorice

TEXT:

A recent survey by the CSIRO has confirmed that dads are the only people out there validating the existence of liquorice.

The study began when scientific communities were divided on how the aniseed confectionery continued to be manufactured and sold when most people found it to be a cruel and insipid substitute for a lolly.

In the 90 page report, the study conclusively found that a few years of decreased motivation, lower sexual satisfaction and disrupted sleep, commonly associated with fatherhood, require strong, vegetable like flavours to puncture the deflated palette of a man who is no longer really there.

Study participant Darrell Lowe stated that the bitter taste of liquorice is something that he can depend upon, unlike his Great Wall ute and visitation rights.

“I can always count on my aniseed,” Lowe said.

The results have been confirmed in a recent study conducted by market research company Roy Morgan, that found 30% of liquorice purchases were made by dad’s who were trusted to do the weekly ‘big-shop’ with the other 70% of purchases were done with the intent of gifting the liquorice to a dad.

Diving deeper into the study, it was found that 90% of liquorice found in lolly bags given out at kids parties were eaten by dad’s in the car on the way home and were often used as a gateway to better lollies such as a Clinker.

#BelieveAllWomenButLetsHearFromGeoffreyRushsBarristersFirst Goes Viral In Inner-City Sydney

TEXT:

As the Geoffrey Rush defamation continues down in Sydney this week, inner-city elites right across the two-zero postcodes are carefully navigating through a light-hearted leftie version of victim shaming.

This comes as a former co-star of Geoffrey Rush’s has fronted the trial to clarify reports that he was making life uncomfortable for her with sexually inappropriate behaviour during the Sydney Theatre Company’s production of King Lear.

Ms Norvill earlier told the court that she had felt “trapped” as Mr Rush “slowly” and “deliberately” ran his fingers over her right breast as she played dead on the stage.

She said he also ran his fingers on the bare skin of her back along the waist-line of her low-cut jeans as they waited in the wings.

Norvill has said she felt “belittled, embarrassed” and “shamed” after the Hollywood star gestured groping her breasts while bulging his eyes and licking his lips during play rehearsals.

These allegations have been with skepticism who can’t possibly fathom an iconic Australian film-and-stage-legend-who-appeals-to-thinkers would act the same way as the neckless NRL stars that are usually skewered by the Murdoch press.

The Oscar winner denies any wrongdoing and claims two front page articles in the Daily Telegraph newspaper about the alleged incident painted him as a “pervert” and “sexual predator” – and this is why they are all at court – to prove that the Daily Telegraph defamed him when they believed the claims made by women that had worked with him.

“Everyone deserves a fair trial” says one inner Sydney local, Bronte Balmain (66) who believes all women except for the ones that are potentially ruining the legacy of a thespian icon.

“We need to be careful about what we say and write about white boomer theatre elites”

“If you, like me, believe most women, you should join me and my friends and use the hashtag #BelieveAllWomenButLetsHearFromGeoffreyRushsBarristersFirst”

Sharp Uptick In Activewear On Campus A Strong Indication It’s Exam Time

TEXT:

Thanks to the strong and increased presence of activewear at the University Of Betoota this month, The Advocate can confirm that exams are in fact on.

This comes after the university reported a 75% rise in sports and gym clothing on campus over the last week.

The uni’s Vice Chancellor Jenny Payton told us that she doesn’t even bother checking the academic calendar for key dates anymore.

“I can tell when mid-sem’s and finals are on,” she laughed.

“When I come into work and almost every single student is decked out like they are about to go to, or have just come from the gym, I know exams are on.”

“It’s a trend we have noticed for a while, but particularly over the last few years we have been seeing an almost activewear blanket coating the university during the final period of the semester.”

Payton explained that another dead give away that exams are on is when every conversation she hears on campus is a competition about who is the “actually” the most “fucked for this exam.”

“It’s obviously got a lot to do with stress levels. We see our female students getting kitted out in their expensive gym clothes 5 days a week, even though less than 10% will attend a place of exercise during the week,” Payton said.

“And we see all of our male students in daggy track pants or footy shorts looking like slobs.”

“We’ve got it too good in this country judging by how stressed these kids are getting over some exams.”

Sunburnt Toowoomba Man Somehow Finds Himself At The Theatre After Big Day At The Track

TEXT:

It is still yet to be confirmed how a borderline comatose young man has managed to find his way somewhere this evening.

28-year-old Council Engineer Aaron Jones has somehow made his way to the Empire Theatre in Toowoomba tonight.

The young man who could barely give The Advocate a ballpark estimate regarding his alcohol consumption over the course of the day explained that his mate sorted the whole thing out.

“Yeah, my mate bought tickets to this thing a few weeks ago and now I’m here,” laughed the young man from Queensland’s ‘City Of Churches.’

“It’s been a pretty big go down here.”

“I had the first ‘white egg’ after the second race, so that probably tells you enough about the trajectory of my Melbourne Cup day.”

“To be honest with you, I’m as surprised as you are that I managed to fucking get here tonight.”

Jones explained that the bookies were kind to him today, and as a result, he has made sure not to pull any punches, in the celebratory sense.

“Life’s great mate. I had a good 12 hours on the punt and the drink,” he said.

“And I’m not from fucking Ipswich [ha ha], so that’s always a good enough reason to celebrate.”

“I had a couple of Vodka Red Bull’s there before as well, so it’s looking like I might even make it to the George Banks afterwards for the after party.”

“Pending I get in obviously. My face feels like someones just ran one of those Sushi blowtorches over it and I’m struggling to stay upright, so wish me luck,” he laughed before asking our reporter to leave and let him enjoy the show.

SportsBet’s Commitment To No BS Cup Day Includes Planned Upgrade Instead Of Taking Bets

TEXT:

Punters all up and down the Betoota Turf Club beer garden are on the cusp of folding their iPhones in half and throwing them to the shithouse after a number of sports betting apps have spectacularly shit the bed on the biggest day of the year.

All of them – except SportsBet.

Rather than capitulate to the pressures of increased betting traffic today, SportsBet used the biggest race day of the year to upgrade their server and app.

“We appreciate our punters,” said one SportsBet representative.

“Which is why rather than take their money today, we’re making sure our platform is strong enough moving into the future. We’re not about to comment on other apps like Ladbrokes and Bet36Cuck because that’d be unprofessional and crass,”

“To show how much we value our customers, we’re giving them thousands in free bets tomorrow when it really matters.”

The SportsBet outage is set to continue until the day is over.

Bloke Pre-Drinking Outside Flemington Dressed In Exact Same Shit He Wore To Court Last Week

TEXT:

Like many others around the country, Dane Rathbone has frocked up in his best today.

One of the biggest days on the nation’s calendar, Rathbone has decided to go all out wearing his best kit – the kit he usually saves for his annual court appearances.

Breaking out the black suit and the white shoes he wore to a hearing at the District Court last week, Dane told The Advocate he is raring to go.

“Pretty good that I got to bust the suit out twice in a week,” he said to us moments ago.

“Slightly better occasion than last week as well,” he laughed.

Rathbone told us the Magistrate gave him a hard time for his 4th DUI charge, but he is doing ‘some course’ and should be sweet to drive again in a few months.

“Nothing to stress about today anyway,” said the man nigh on screaming ‘Yewwwwww’ everyone couple of minutes on the crowded public transport he made his way to the track on.

“Fucking knocked over a few already aye (sic).”

“Don’t mind a couple of white eggs for breakfast.”

Rathbone then told us that he would be going on the nose of ‘some thing his uncle reckons should be good for it’.

“Anyway, I’m off,” he said.

“These tins aren’t gonna sink themselves.”

Virgin Say They Will Also Salute All Hospitality Staff Who Work A Melbourne Cup

TEXT:

Bartenders, waitresses, cellarmen, managers, licensees, glassies and other assorted hospitality staff who’ve served during a Melbourne Cup will be saluted by Virgin Australia from next year under a controversial plan to raise awareness of the many sacrifices made by our nation’s hospitality staff during the nation’s biggest race day.

The airline has pledged to let Cup veterans board ahead of regular passengers and acknowledge them for their service during in-flight announcements.

Virgin Australia chief executive officer John Borghetti told The Advocate that: “We acknowledge the important contribution hospitality workers have made to keeping our tongues wet and bets placed during Melbourne Cup”

However, the plan has been met with criticism from the head of the Australian Hoteliers Association, who says veterans of Melbourne Cup days never asked for this and it feels ‘tokenistic’ and ‘American’.

Stacey Gollen, who’s been at the helm of the AHA for a number of years, said that while they appreciate Virgin’s sentiments, the fact remains that the veterans don’t want this.

“Most veterans who’ve bravely served the public during a Melbourne Cup day don’t want to be singled out when they’re just trying to keep to themselves on an airplane,” she said.

“And that’s the God’s honest truth. Melbourne Cup Day veterans need support in other ways, not this tokenistic bureaucrat auto-fellating garbage. What about helping veterans overcome the trauma that comes with serving your country on the frontline in the face of great peril?”

“No. You’ve got politicians and red-faced fat fuck CEOs patting themselves on the back. What about giving half a billion dollars to Veterans Affairs?”

Bar Staff Phone Their Loved Ones Before Going To War Against The Tarocash Army Today

TEXT:

Nearly a thousand infantrymen from the Imperial Tarocash Army are expected to invade the Betoota Turf Club general admission area today to watch the Melbourne Cup on the big screen – which has prompted the club’s hospitality staff to phone their loved ones ahead of battle today.

Because the harsh reality of the situation is that while horses will inevitably die a shocking, inhumane death today in Victoria, some bar staff might also pay the ultimate price.

Dennis O’Leary has been the bar manager at Betoota Turf Club for only nine weeks.

Today is his first Melbourne Cup and, he says, he’s feeling the pressure.

“I’ve phoned the wife to say I love her and that if I die today, don’t wait around mourning me. She can move on because life is too short. Just not with like a good mate or my brother or something. That’d raise me from the dead, that would,” he said.

The Advocate has set up shop early today at the Betoota Race Track Media Centre and can feel the energy in the air.

“You know what they say, you haven’t worked in hospitality until you’ve had to work a Melbourne Cup,”

“So I’ve instructed all my staff to find a minute this morning to phone their significant others because we don’t know what’s going to happen today. The company anticipates we might lose a few glassies. We’re not even using glass today so I’m not sure how they worked that one out.”

Our reporter hugged Dennis and wished him the best of luck.

City Worker’s Current Monday Afternoon Existential Crisis Might Stem From Huge Weekend

TEXT:

A youngish man broke the monotony of an afternoon from hell by retiring to the restroom for the sole purpose of looking himself in the mirror.

Our reporter, who was in the said restroom when Peter Pooley walked in, sat silently in a cubical playing Snakes and Ladders on his phone.

Peter let out a long sigh and started talking to himself.

“What is wrong with you?” he asked himself.

Then there was silence, broken only by Peter softly saying ‘Fuck’.

But while it might seem odd, The Advocate can reveal that they saw Peter on the weekend and he was doing some heavy-duty living.

“Why am I like this?” he asked himself.

Suddenly, one of Peter’s colleagues walked in to empty himself at the trough.

That prompted the 28-year-old to wash his hands needlessly and head back to his cubical.

As our reporter was leaving the restroom himself, after wasting close to 30 minutes, he observed Peter staring out the window as he shook his head with mild conviction.

“He will be OK,” said one of Peter’s closest work friends.

“He said this morning that he did three pressed pingas on Saturday night, cried in a stranger’s garden, then passed out on the nature strip in front of his ex’s new boyfriends apartment block,”

“I’d be feeling the same way right about now. Don’t worry, though. He should be right by Thursday morning, ready to do it all again this weekend.”

Plain Clothes Cop Blows Cover By Asking Teenage Drug Dealer To ‘Add Him On MSN’

TEXT:

Local teenagers were left in a state of confusion yesterday, after a seemingly ‘cool’ older man asked them if they were active users of the MSN Messenger Service,in a vacant car park.

Ollie Wyndham, 16, says the group became suspicious of the man after he made reference to the discontinued instant messenger service, which was rebranded as Windows Messenger in 2005.

“My mum used to use MSN… I seriously didn’t think that shit was still around?”

The group, which consisted of three-to-four recreational marijuana users, were approached by the 42-year-old while skateboarding. They say the man initially asked them where he could find some ‘good pot’ and if they were ‘on MSN’

That is when they realised he was an undercover cop.

Since the arrival of social media, instant messaging software has died down to a small community of outdated Blackberry users, and apparently 42-year-old undercover police officers who have no idea how to infiltrate the technologically advanced Generation Y.

“I thought he might have been an undercover ‘D’ when I saw what he was wearing,” says the street-savvy Mr Wyndham.

“He was wearing a studded SMP belt with Globe shoes. Not to mention his wallet chain… He had a Sony Discman visibly sitting in the trouser pockets of his cargo pants. A fucking discman!”

Mr Wyndham and his friends said they gave the officer the benefit of the doubt, assuming he may have been ‘a bit slow’ and was legitimately interested in where he could find marijuana for personal use. That was until he went on to ask for contact details.

“If he’d asked for my mobile number, I would have probably tee’d him up with my dealer”
“… But he wanted my Hotmail account. I told him ‘I’m 16 years old, mate… I don’t even use email’ – I could tell he was out of touch”

“My advice for undercover cops would be, if you want to find out the whereabouts of local marijuana dealers. Just go to any of the events hosted by Triple J”

“Mind you, Triple J is about as youth-oriented as this cop was. They probably arrested all those blokes in the 90’s”

“No wonder they are passing all those metadata laws – but we are already one step ahead of that with these crazy things called apps“

Problem Gambler Thankful Betting App Won’t Ever Leave Him Like His BS Wife And Kids Did

Mike Simmons told our reporter he’s a long way off cashing out with the old toaster in the bath trick – but never say never, he says.

The 28-year-old explained to The Advocate that he’s tried to quit gambling on sports, horse racing and Namibian bike polo many times but the constant bombardment of betting-related advertising has made that difficult.

“I haven’t lost everything yet,” he said, looking down at the brown sugar slowly dissolve through the head of his cappuccino.

Simmons caught up with our reporter at the Pigeon & Cholera Canteen down in the Flight Path District earlier this morning.

“My wife took the girls away from me though. She gave me a few chances but I guess I’m just weak. I feel pretty weird about it. My betting app keeps making me feel like a winner but my wife kept calling me a fucking loser,”

“Maybe I am a fucking loser? My kids were eating cereal for weeks before they walked out on me. My fucking BS family, man,”

“Lucky my betting app won’t abandon me like they did. It’ll always be there to give me the best odds and give me the option to cash out early if it looks like I’m about to lose. The ads are so relatable, too. They always have portly blokes in pubs half cut with their mates. I don’t have any mates anymore.”

Best Man Given Task Of Telling The Wedding DJ That He’s Not God

TEXT:

A quaint if not overtly-religious wedding ceremony took a brief detour as best man Alex Poltorak (28) was given the onerous task of telling the wedding DJ that he is not God.

After a series of speeches that left the guests feeling like they would never be allowed to leave, wedding DJ Gavin Scott (33) began cranking out the hits with a few unexpected numbers that got the steadily tipsy crowd moving, even though the tunes weren’t on the bride and grooms incredibly strict playlist.

“Playlist, shmaylist,” stated DJ Gavin, demonstrating a blatant lack of how to disregard a concept within the current social culture.

“If they are so good at making playlists wouldn’t they be the wedding DJ? Haha, not!”

At approximately 8:30 pm, it is reported that bride Sarah Hughes told groom Phil Hughes that he better do something about the music or they were about to spend their first sexless night together as a married couple.

Relying on a man who once shaved a large chunk of his hair off, Phil asked his best man Alex Poltorak if he could remind the DJ that he is a person being paid to do a job and not an all-seeing deity with a divine plan for each of the guests.

Witness reports state best man Poltorak tried to appeal to the DJ’s humanistic side before remembering most DJs no longer see themselves as human but as an omnipotent and ever-present forces that know how people work and how some buttons on a mixing desk work.

“Mate? You wanna help someone get laid tonight? Make sure it’s the groom, put the fucking playlist back on and pull ya head in.”

“I’m A Southpaw” Says City Worker After Second Session At Local Combat Gym

TEXT:

A local pen-pusher has revealed his fighting style to The Betoota Advocate today.

The account manager at Marketing Agency in Betoota’s Old City District confirmed to us that he is, in fact, a ‘southpaw.’

In the boxing world, a southpaw stance is one where the boxer has his right hand and right foot forward and is effectively the term for a left-hander.

The man named Thomas Holden told us that his boxing style was confirmed after his second boxing session down at a gym in the Flightpath District.

“Yeah my coach told me I’m a southpaw last night,” Holden said.

“I sort of knew I was one anyway, I’ve gotta pretty strong left hook on me you know,” he laughed.

The news came after Holden signed up for a ludicrously expensive Corporate Boxing program in some attempt to become more masculine.

“It’s a pretty sweet gig man. A couple of training sessions for a few months and then they throw me in the ring with another bloke and we go toe to toe,” Holden said.

“I’m gonna be bringing the heat with the big left hook,” he said motioning with some right jabs followed by a few ‘ootz ootz’ noises.

“Pretty scary how much progress I’ve already made.”

Holden’s coach Tony Nicconi told The Advocate he likes to massage the ego’s of the corporates that come down to him.

“Obviously he is a Southpaw. He is a left-hander and certainly hasn’t got anywhere near enough physical power to be able to hook with his opposite hand,” Nicconi said.

“You’ve just got to tell these city workers things like that so they get a sugar hit ego boost.”

Bloke Riding Motorbike In Boardies Forces Everyone To Imagine Those Pins Full Of Gravel

TEXT:

A local daredevil has made local motorists imagine a disgusting scenario today by deciding to ride into town without proper motorbike attire.

Shayne Nicholls caused the commotion earlier this morning, as he sped through traffic along the Diamantina Development Road into town.

Reports have been confirmed that the plasterer from Betoota’s Ponds District has a horrible habit of hopping on his old Honda and hooning around without any protective clothing.

As can be seen in the image captured by one of our photographers, Nicholls was riding into town this morning without motorbike pants, gloves and a jacket, forcing other commuters to imagine his pale skin peppered with blue metal.

One commuter called Phil Watson told us the image stayed in his mind for some time.

“It was horrible,” he said.

“Imagining those legs just that disgusting blood orange colour filled with little bits of stone in there. You know when it doesn’t actually bleed or anything it’s just horribly grazed.”

“The kind of thing that getting in the shower with is the stuff of nightmares.”

Another commuter echoed the sentiments as well.

“He doesn’t look tough. It doesn’t impress anyone,” she laughed.

“I mean I know it’s been a few decades since those flairey wide piped pants were a thing, and motorbike pants are not exactly flattering on the human body, but they are a whole lot more flattering that legs that looks like they’ve been tackled on the cricket pitch 20 times.”

“All the while, Arthur is enjoying hearty home cooked meals, paddock to plate game such as deer and jackrabbits. He’s eating like a Persian Prince compared to me!” he told our reporter.

“Mate, I’ve been eating like I’m back at university living on youth allowance issued to me by a Liberal government. The first few mouthfuls of Mi-Goreng are nice but downing a triple pack in a salad bowl at 1am on a Tuesday isn’t how I thought my 30s would go down,”

“Bottom line is I’m having fun, anyway. Living alone and being single means you can do what you want, when you want. And this is all I want to do now.”

Concerned for 32-year-old’s health, our reporter walked down to the føtex in the Betoota Heights Stocklands and bought him some chicken sausages and a kilo of oranges.

Six Months In, Man’s Purchase Of Playboy Cologne Has Somehow Failed To Net Him A Single Root

TEXT:

On an unseasonably cold and wet Monday afternoon in April, Dexter Pearson’s world came crashing down around him.

The polite but ultimately simple business studies student had just planned a mid-winter escape for he and his then-girlfriend, Carrot Brick, to Lord Howe Island.

He planned to tell her over a steamy tepanyaki dinner the night of the 30th – but the evening went a different direction to what he’d hoped.

“Carrot told me she couldn’t do what we were doing anymore, apologised for not telling me sooner, then got up and left,” recalled Dexter.

The 25-year-old sat down with The Advocate this afternoon, ironically at the same tepanyaki restaurant his will to live died in almost exactly 6 months ago.

“But rather than let it get me down, I started smoking bongs again and let my housemate and his missus go on the holiday to Lord Howe. I couldn’t get a refund and I didn’t want it to go to waste. I was too busy trying to get my life back on track [laughs] I’m OK now, though,”

“The day after Carrot threw me in the shitheap, my brother came over with a little present to cheer me up. I knew all I had to do to get over the funk was to root a complete stranger, I just needed a little help.”

The silver bullet to Dexter’s lady woes, or so he thought, was a bottle of Playboy’s Miami cologne that his younger brother, Pewter, gifted him in the days after the break-up.

At 16, young Pewter revealed some trade secrets to his deadshit older brother about how to woo and swoon a woman – with the most important factor being how you smell and the amount of hair gel you have in.

However, over the past six months, Dexter has used up almost all the Playboy fragrance.

“And nothing has happened. The bottle pretty much guarantees me that women will form an orderly queue at the bar in order to give me their phone numbers. The closest I’ve been to scoring a quickfire tonne in the past six months has been some lady accidentally walked backwards into me at the bus stop. I got to smell her hair,”

“This shit is hopeless. Don’t take to me about droughts, Barnaby Joyce! I’m fucking living one!”

Popular Rapper In The News Again For Saying Something About Some Things He Did One Time

Kanye West, a popular American rapper and producer, has made headlines again around the world for making comments on something he once did.

The Advocate can reveal that West (41) said he no longer feels like he likes US President Donald Trump and that he regrets saying things he once said because now he has had his eyes open to numerous lies or something to that effect.

“I regret doing some things I did in the past,” said West.

That was enough for the news media around the world to report on the regret felt by the singer-songwriter, with headlines appealing in every major English-language newspaper in the free world.

One local newspaper editor, The Advocate‘s own Clancy Overell, took time out of his busy morning of shooing flies out of the newspaper’s lobby to speak to our reporter about Kanye.

“He gets a lot of clicks,” Overell stated.

“If you quote exactly what I say in this article, people will read what I’ve said and feel pretty silly about wasting their lives reading about some lunatic Kardashian handbag in an Outback Queensland newspaper,”

“But, you know, it is what it is. It’s like how young folk blow up about MTV only broadcasting shows about blokes showing each other their cocks or something like that! You get what you deserve in life, including journalism.”

Yuppie Dad Sporting A Boston Red Sox Hat Completely Oblivious To Recent World Series Win

A Betoota Grove father-of-four was spotted at The Whooton School Fête earlier this week in his dashing Boston Red Sox dad cap – completely oblivious to the fact that the New Englanders won the Major League Baseball ‘World’ Series yesterday in Los Angeles.

The Red Sox, who defeated the LA Dodgers in this year’s series, were the red-hot favourites going into the world championships and stormed home 4-1 to clinch their ninth title.

But all that is Arthur Cambridge-Grubb.

The 44-year-old is seldom seen without his Boston cap and his younger wife Kimberly is rarely spotted without her Yankees hat.

Our reporter approached Artie, as he’s known to his golfing buddies, as he perused the organic seawater selections at the fête to ask him about the Red Sox victory.

“Oh,” he said.

“Right. Can’t you see I’m busy here? I’ve got guests coming over tonight and I need to choose some seawater. Should I pay more for Atlantic or just settle for the el cheapo Pacific?”

A popular local beverage in Betoota is a vodka, lime and carbonated seawater. The drink was made famous by Robert O’Hara Burke, who tragically died of thirst after consuming 32 of them in one sitting.

The Advocate told him to choose the top-shelf, fully-import Arctic Ocean water because he’s worth it.

However, Artie went on to say he didn’t really give a blue fuck about baseball or the Red Sox – he just knows that the MLB teams make the most comfortable and locally ambiguous hats in the world.

Mate Really Sounding Like A Loser Boss During Phone Call With One Of His Younger Colleagues

The young engineer from Betoota Heights was sprung using his ‘other voice’ during a phone call.

Foolishly taking a work call in the vicinity of a group of friends down at the recently done up Royal Hotel in Betoota’s Old City District, Johns was asking for trouble.

“Oh yeah Gday mate,” he answered the phone call in a completely different voice to the one he uses on a daily basis.

“Yeah Steve, if you can just sort out those specs for this arvo I’ll talk to you about it tomorrow,” the young man said in the deepest voice he could possibly muster.

One of the Jobs friends enjoying a beer with him explained that the change of voice made their week.

“It’s such a fucking pissa,” he said.

“He’s a white-collar tertiary educated inner-city resident with a voice like you’d imagine. But, when he is talking to a colleague or mate from footy he automatically tries to sound like he’s had a lifetime of smoking darts and laying bricks,” the friend said.

“It’s almost impressive how he can drop the pitch like an overweight 58-year-old Italian European tenor.”

Jobs, however, said he was confused about our line of questioning moments ago.

Sharehouse Couch Begins New Journey With Sharehouse That Just Walked Past It On The Street

Residents of ‘The Snake Pitt’ have regretfully moved their three-seater couch on to the street this morning after three long years of service.

The five residents of the share house said this was not an easy decision for them to make, but with some of them starting to get more serious partners, they collectively decided it might be time to give the old house a bit of a spruce.

In memory of the sofa, the girls paused for a minute’s silence before leaving it on the street for good.

“Yeah it’s sad to say goodbye, but I’m sure it’ll find a good home” said one resident.

And he was right, like hyenas on a carcass, future couch owners scurried out of nowhere, all eager to lay claim on the prized 3-seater.

A house full of reggae musicians managed to win out after they were the only ones with enough numbers to get the couch home on foot.  The Advocate caught up with the two long-haired uni students as they were about to leave the scene.

“Oh yeah, pretty excited about it, hey” said one bong head in a slow drawl.

“Reckon it’ll go pretty well on the front porch, set it up nice for when summer comes and we can have a few adventure cones out there” he continued.

It’s understood that the new boys said the old owners were welcome to stop by and check on the couch any time they wished, but as it looks pretty scat and will be covered in bong water it’s likely to be a hard no.

Coworker Who’s Always Talking About Her Shares Is In A Real Mood This Morning

A soft but widely audible ‘fuck’ poured out of Isabelle Rutland’s mouth this morning, just past 10 am local time, as the Australia Stock Exchange opened after widespread panic selling in New York overnight.

The young inventor had anticipated things would be bad – but not this bad.

Speaking to our reporter this morning via an end-to-end encrypted messenger service, the 28-year-old mergers and acquisitions specialist at Bell Potter South Betoota (the McDonalds of private wealth management) said that she’s not panicking herself just yet but things are only looking down from here.

“My portfolio is more diverse than an album of stock images,” she said.

“And still. I’m haemorrhaging money. The losses have been lead in the most part by my tech holdings. Small-cap miners are junk. You might as well sell them and buy something that’ll bring me joy,”

“Everything is fucked. If I had cash, I’d buy more. But I don’t. Fuck this fucking market. Fuck Donald Trump and his tiny dick war with China. Fucks sake. It’s killing me.”

Mushroom Bun On Local Works Burger Found To Make It Automatically Healthy

Tradesman Confronts Arch Nemesis During Heated Midweek Showdown In Local Loading Zone

TEXT:

A remarkably unpopular local parking ranger is in the hospital this morning and a French Quarter builder is facing charges after a heated argument turned physical in a Rue de Branlette loading zone around 9 am.

Police will allege that David Conn, of Allen Street in Betoota Heights, drilled a hole in the hand of Bradley Wallace Coleman during a confrontation over a parking ticket.

Coleman, who has been working as a parking ranger for the Diamantina Shire Council for almost a decade, told police that Conn had parked his late model Great Wall Steed 4×2 in a loading zone illegally.

When asked to move his Chinese billycart to a legal park, Conn allegedly threatened to ‘get’ the parking ranger if he went near his car.

Witnesses say Conn used ‘the foulest possible language’ and picked up an idle drill to threaten Coleman with.

As the verbal tit-for-tat began to escalate, Coleman raised his hands in an effort to pacify Conn, who then proceeded to drill a hole clean through one of the outstretched palms in front of his face.

Special Constable Annie Spears, of South Betoota Police, said the investigation into the incident and more information will be made available to the public as it comes.

“Who gave this gibbering old cunt his licence? He is going to get somebody killed.”

No, Maggie Hallend hasn’t woken up on the wrong side of the bed.

Mercury isn’t in retrograde at the moment – and she’s not a cynical Gemini hellbent on being mean for the fuck of it. In fact, the 28-year-old is an overly polite and painfully meek Cancerian who avoids confrontation like it’s Tooheys New at the Breakfast Creek Hotel.

Maggie has just encountered the dumbest man in town.

Her drive to work this morning at the Diamantina Credit Union in South Betoota was accosted by Peter Costigan, a sexagenarian with a reputation that precedes him all over town.

Whether it’s an unsolicited chat at the Elephant & Pogostick Hotel of an evening’s time or his inability to merge while on the move, almost everybody in our fine desert community has had a run in with Peter fucking Costigan.

Just last year, Peter was driving into the sun down Mullholland Road in Betoota Heights when he ran up the back of The Advocate‘s editor, Clancy Overell, on his brand new Giant road bike as he trained for the gruelling Tour De Betoota Putain.

Clancy walked away with only a bruised coccyx, ruptured eardrum and a nipple lost to road rash but somehow, Peter managed to hold on to his licence.

Our reporter, by some miracle, managed to run into Peter this morning at the French Quarter Baker’s Delight, just minutes after almost causing a car accident that would’ve probably claimed Maggie’s birth privilege to walk and feed herself.

When asked if he feels that he’s a menace to other people while on the road, Peter laughed and said no.

“Everybody is in such a hurry,” he said, eating his 10 am neenish tart.

“So I let all those rushing people go before me. It doesn’t matter who has the right of way, I like to be as helpful as possible.”

One gobsmacked French Quarter denizen delighting in the bakery turned his head to see what type of moron was speaking such tripe.

But after noticing it was Peter, they went back to ordering their cheesy bacon roll.

Local Vet Quietly Cheering After Yet Another French Bulldog Pup Turns Up In The Neighbourhood

TEXT:

“This breed is basically like owning a vintage Alfa Romeo,” laughed the vet.

“They’re born half-fucked and they slowly get fully fucked. Don’t get me wrong, I love all dogs but it’s the French Bulldogs that put my kids through private school, I tell you. Somethings always wrong with them. Fucking ear drops, eye drops, skin irritations,”

“You name it, these dogs get it. It’s sad for me AND the owner when the Frenchie comes in the for the last time, absolutely peppered with the Spanish dancer. The gravy train is over.”

Nestled on the fringe of the Betoota Grove shopping village, Dr Melissa Grace’s veterinarian practice enjoys a humble trade.

As the go-to vet for our town’s well-heeled residents, Grace said her job is incredibly rewarding both financially and emotionally.

But, she admits, it can be tough at times.

“When a hardy breed comes in like a kelpie or cattledog, you think to yourself, ‘There’s no margin in this for me,’ and you just have to sigh,”

“But when you first meet a frenchie puppy and it’s already about to kick the bucket, you just have to quietly cheer to yourself. This’ll pay off half my new Passat stationwagon. Fuck yes.”

Beachgoer Completes Ultimate Act Of Friendship And Rubs Sunscreen Into Mates Back

TEXT:

Zach Brown has been praised for his efforts yesterday.

The 28-year-old plumber from Betoota Heights pushed himself to the very limits yesterday.

Down the Sunshine Coast for the weekend with a group of friends, young Brown was called upon to step right outside his comfort zone.

After giving it a relative nudge the night before at some bowling club before kicking on at their rental house for the weekend, the pipe layer from the Heights had certainly felt better.

With a refreshing and uplifting trip to the beach underway, Brown could almost feel his body rejuvenating with the crisp sea breeze blowing all over him and the warm sand crunching underneath his feet.

However, it was at that point, that one of Brown’s mates decided to call upon him to commit an incredible act of service.

“Can you sunscreen my back, please Browny,” asked one of his friends.

Taking the question like a sledgehammer, Brown was left weighing up whether to push the confines of his mind and lather up his mates back.

After some sighing and cursing under his breath, Brown decided to demonstrate his strong will and friendship qualities and set about rubbing the greasy white substance all over his mates back.

Speaking to The Advocate today, the young man opened up about the experience.

“Honestly, I fucking hate rubbing sunscreen on my own body, or even that of my girlfriend’s,” he said.

“But rubbing it all over my piece of shit mate’s back is something else entirely.”

“I’m really not even sure how I managed to push through and get it done. I feel sick thinking about it,” he said.

“I have to go now. Old mate’s toilet’s blocked. What a fuck of a job for a Monday morning. Still not as bad as what I had to do yesterday though.”

Government Study Concludes Nothing Is More Uncool Than New Riding Boots

TEXT:

Clip-clopping his way out of the grimmest Young Liberal’s meeting in years, Darcy Alistair thought nothing could be worse than this.

However, he was wrong.

While many of the 26-year-old’s aspiring political staffer’s friends had already started drowning their sorrows at Betoota Grove establishment, The Dickless Parrot, young Darcy was still walking around the block trying to put a few kays on his new boots.

Because, he says, nothing is more uncool than brand new riding boots.

“They’re only a day old,” he said.

“When I first walked in this morning, all the boys laughed at me. Some of the girls did too but luckily the boys were there to put them in their box,”

“I don’t get it. Old riding boots are super cool and desirable but how do you get them to that point? Do you just grit your teeth? Being young is fucking harder than it looks.”

The Advocate reached out to a number of Darcy’s friends from the Young Liberals but all were too busy keeping a bedside vigil for one of their lippy mates who got bashed on the weekend for running his mouth in front of the wrong person.

However, Darcy’s feelings on the matter have been reaffirmed by a government study released this Monday morning which outline just how lame brand new boots are.

Australia’s peak scientific body, the CSIRO, explained in their 2-page report that while boots get cooler the more you wear them, the first few months can be tough.

“There’s only one thing worse,” said one chronically-underfunded researcher.

“Rolling your chinos up so people can see you hate family owned Australian business by purchasing a pair of foreign-owned RM Williams boots. If you buy anything RM Williams, uppercut yourself,”

“Buy a pair of Baxter boots. They are family-owned and Australian made. They’re also priced fairly and wear better than the faux-horn variety. Baxters are always cool no matter how old or new they are. Well… maybe the older ones are a bit cooler.”

The former Prime Minister awoke early today in New York, put his favourite Gazman trousers on, buttoned his crispest Hugo Boss business shirt and retired to the living room of his bespoke Upper East Side apartment to watch the news.

Malcolm Turnbull had to wake Lucy twice in order for her to get the ChromeCast going of the ABC24 live stream going.

She said he was being silly – but Malcolm knew he was anything but.

Speaking to our reporter via Skype, as our newspaper is a front for his political ideology, Malcolm said that he got up for a reason.

“I needed to see this,” he said, laughing.

“When I quit, I knew this was going to happen. This wasn’t some sort of Bennelong Howard business. This was people power. This is a dog up the conservative government,”

“I’m sorry. I can’t help but laugh.”

The Advocate reached out to a number of crossbenchers who now run the country, namely Bob Katter, but he was out in the community talking to people because he’s an independent who loves his constituents.

Sensible Middle-Class Family Rocked To Their Core By Unprecedented Belly Button Piercing

TEXT:

Maddie Hay (18) has just sent shockwaves through her sensible middle-class family after revealing to her mother and father that she got her belly button pierced on the weekend with her friend Chelsea.

The announcement came as quite a shock to the parents who only let Maddie get her ears pierced when she was 16 and were still a bit iffy on the whole social media thing.

“JESUS MADELINE!” shouted her father.

“Now now, Bill, don’t yell.” Said Maddie’s mother trying to calm Bill.

“But Maddie, why? Only tarts get belly button piercings, we didn’t raise a tart”

“Omg can you guys just chill? No one is even going to see it!” said Maddie.

“IF NO ONE’S GOING TO SEE IT, THEN WHY DID YOU GET IT?” added her dad clearly at his wits end.

“I just got it for me, you know, it’s something that I wanted to do for me.”

“I didn’t know you guys would get so angry” added Maddie sheepishly.

“We’re not angry, Maddie, just disappointed,” said her mum, before turning away in shame.

It’s understood that this kind of exchange between parent and child will increase in the coming months with kids leaving high school, which often symbolises the moment of no return for young adults, as it’s the first time they’re let out in society and take the opportunity to completely rebel.

Parents with loser kids have been given extra warning about this time as their kids are more likely to show signs of rebellion.

“Everything Is Fine” Says Political Party About To Lose One Of Its Safest Seats Tomorrow

TEXT:

The Coalition is set to lose one of its safest seats tomorrow at the Wentworth byelection.

Located in Sydney’s far east, home to the type of people who’d be the first to hang from streetlights when the inevitable revolution happens, Wentworth has only ever hosted Liberal Party victories.

However, tomorrow it’s set to be defeated by a popular independent.

Speaking today to The Advocate this morning via telephone, Prime Minister Scott Morrison laughed when our reporter asked him if everything was OK.

“Everything’s fine, my friend,” said Morrison, paternally.

“Dave Sharma is going to shit it in. He cannot lose. The Liberals cannot lose in Wentworth. It is proven scientific fact, like gravity,”

“Malcolm and his polite and helpful son can snipe at us all they want. It’s going to take more than that to bring down the Liberal Party. Because we are a team, we are all on Team Australia. Tomorrow, all of us are on Team Wentworth. I will be there, in a back-to-front Royal Prince Edward Yacht Club dad cap that Malcolm gave me last year for my birthday. Everything will be fine.”

Our reporter also spoke to a number of Wentworth residents, most of whom took the opportunity to talk down to our regional newspaper in a disparaging tone.

Never-the-less, all who took time out of their busy morning of investing diligently in blue-chip stocks, negatively gearing their property assets and failing to indicate at intersections to speak to The Advocate said this is revenge for what the Liberals did to their Malcolm.

“He [Malcolm] epitomised what is was to be a Wentworth resident. To appear outwardly socially-conscious. IE to have some homosexual friends. Perhaps even some friends-of-colour. To appear to care about social issues, I meant to say,” said one uppity chode from Double Bay.

“But to be fiscally conservative. Lower the company tax rate and whatnot. I’ve set myself up as a trust so I pay the lower company tax rate, instead of the common personal income tax that wage earners pay,”

“And they my Malcolm to the sword. Tomorrow we roast you latent misogynists, sexists and homophobes. Liberals out of Wentworth now!”

“Curls Get The Girls” Confirms Possible Serial Killer

TEXT:

A long and wildly held theory has been confirmed today.

The theory, that curly hair is in someway more sexually attractive to women has been vindicated in a landmark day for science.

More commonly expressed as ‘Curls Get The Girls,’  the theory was given weight after a local League Of Legends enthusiast confirmed it today.

Levi Davids, a 27-year-old curly-headed bachelor from Betoota Heights spoke to us about his groundbreaking verification of the phrase.

“I’m surprised anyone’s shocked,” laughed the young man who may one day be the focus of a smash hit podcast.

“I thought everyone knew that ladies love luscious locks with a bit of pizazz in em.”

Davids explained that if you needed any more proof in the pudding, then he can just show you a record of his promiscuity.

“I’ve done my fair share of swooning this year,” chortled the fedora enthusiast.

“I mean I don’t wanna name names or anything like that, but let me tell you, I have a had a few steamy encounters.”

Davids then told us that he laughs at the kids at school who used to give him shit about his hair.

“Levi you curly head fuck they used to say! Jokes on them. I work in IT and romance beautiful women now” the man who often goes to dinner in cotton track pants and joggers said.

“Also why was one of your reporters following when I went down to Lake Betoota the other night?” he asked.

Katter Moves Motion In Parliament That It’s Ok To Not Want To Be Torn To Pieces By A Crocodile

TEXT:

Australian politician Bob Katter III MP has declared “anti-wanting-to-kill-crocs-out-of-fear” discrimination is on the rise, and will move a motion in federal parliament saying “it’s OK to not want to be torn apart by crocodiles”

The KAP leader said anyone who watched the news or social media could see increased attacks on on North Queenslanders who are terrified because every three months someone gets torn to pieces by crocodiles.

“It is indeed OK to be conscious of the dangers posed by an overpopulation of crocodiles. Such a simple sentence should go without saying but I suspect many members in this place would struggle to say it,” hhe told parliament.

“People have a right to be proud of their fear of crocodiles and their motivation to do something about it”

Crossbench senator Derryn Hinch savaged Katter, saying she was locked in a race to the bottom of the sewer with the Greens who think that Kangaroos are nearly extinct.

“It could have been written on a piece of toilet paper,” Senator Hinch said of the motion.

“This sort of croc-bashing is not only wrong, it could be dangerous.”

Greens leader Richard Di Natale also had a crack at former One Nation senator Anning and his new mate Katter.

“The reality is this ‘it’s OK to not want to be torn to pieces by crocodiles’ slogan has got a long history in the fishing and shooters movement where both these clowns get most of their material from” Senator Di Natale said.

‘Locals Only’ Tag At Metropolitan Beach Makes It Clear Only A Few Million People Can Surf Here

TEXT:

Just in case there ever was any doubt, a poorly graffed tag on the foreshore of a city beach has made it clear today who owns a certain little chunk of land.

The graffiti plastered on by some marginally employed youth last night has overturned the long-held legal doctrine that it isn’t legally possible for anyone to actually own the area of land immediately adjacent to the ocean, or the ocean itself.

The tags proclaim that the beach is only for a certain few million residents of the state and country.

It is being reported that the young testosterone fuelled men who tagged the beach wall did so because they feel a strong connection to the break, built up through nearly two whole generations of surfing.

The once moderately rough suburb has, in fact, become a relatively high socioeconomic suburb as a result of skyrocketing prices due to the ‘locals only’ surfing rule.

One local youth who refused to give his full name to our reporter told The Advocate that people don’t wanna find out what the punishment for breaking the new law is.

“Deadset brah, I mean technically yeah, the locals only rule actually allows like 5 million people to surf the break, but I can tell ya brah, you don’t wanna test the legalities of the case in the court of the Beach Boys [the name of the group local surfers] alright,” he said with his wetsuit draped around his waist.

“You gotta be born into this suburb because your working-class parents were lucky enough to buy here decades ago, or have the coin to be able to buy a gnarly two million dollar three bedder within a ‘k’ from the beach,” the young man said.

“Or a hot girl, sorry I forgot that notable exception. Hot gurfers are definitely allowed,” he laughed

“Anyway gotta go now, boys are heading out for the arvo.”

ABC24 Accidentally Broadcast Live Images From Inside Liberal Party Room

TEXT:

As the blame game continues over the ‘accidental and regrettable’ support for One Nation’s controversial ‘It’s OK To Be White’ motion in the Senate yesterday, the ABC has been forced to apologise to their conservative overlords for accidentally broadcasting live images from inside their party room this afternoon.

The images, which depicted a large, smouldering train wreck surrounded by burning dad hats was only shown on screen around the country for a few seconds – but the damage was done, according to some Liberal MPs.

Speaking to The Advocate this afternoon after tonguing clean a six-pack of YoGo Gorillas, Mathias Cormann (who moonlights often as the Leader of the Government in the Senate) said the ABC’s mistake was unprofessional at the very least.

“And people ask why we cut their funding,” said the barrel-chested Belgian, wiping the remaining YoGo off his face with his tie.

“Completely unacceptable. To broadcast such sensitive and confidential information. On national television! That was supposed to be a private train wreck,”

“It’s caused us a great deal of embarrassment!”

Our reporter also reached out to the office of George Christensen for comment but apparently, his entire staff is occupied trying to get him unstuck from a handrail inside a National Party wing fire escape.

Early reports indicate the Queenslander fell and got his head stuck between the steps and the bottom rail of the balustrade.

Despite having a litre of canola oil poured over his head, he remains trapped.

Nobody at the ABC was willing to answer any of our questions either.

Friend’s Ugly Engagement Ring Still Looks Really… Wow

TEXT:

local woman has today had to call on her two semesters of year 10 drama after her friend shoved her engagement ring in her face for the fifth time in one sitting.

Stacey Wakefield admitted to The Advocate that she didn’t like lying to her friend, but the engagement ring just left her at a loss for words – well, kind ones anyway.

“She can’t possibly like it”

“It literally looks like a colour-blind chimp with tongs for hands has made it”

“If my boyfriend proposed to me with that ring I’d flat out say no.”

Interested to see this grotesque assortment of jewels, The Advocate reached out to Stacey’s recently engaged friend, Josephine Aldo.

We were careful to approach under the guise of researching for a feature article on modern day engagement rings, not that her best friend Stacey’s been talking shit about her ring behind her back.

“Well, here it is!” Josephine said while proudly presenting her ring.

“It’s gorgeous isn’t it?”

Not wanting to answer, our reporter engaged in her own evasive tactics. We can confirm though that the ring is really… just wow. Not something that you’d pick out for yourself that’s for sure.

Engagement rings are such a personal and subjective item though, so while the majority of people may secretly find your engagement ring ugly, all that matters is you’re happy.

Betting Agencies Take Odds On What Will Cause Outrage Next Week After The Everest Is Over

TEXT:

The world’s richest and most exclusive horse-race-on-turf will happen in Sydney this weekend – then something equally as controversial and divisive will happen the next.

That’s the message from a number of betting agencies around the country today as they begin to take odds on what will be the next destination of the outrage train next week.

The Advocate spoke to a number of representatives from local online betting agencies today in the function room of the Betoota Dolphins Leagues Club.

SportsBet, a popular online bookie built on the back of crippling addiction and the bad fortune off millions, has a federal politician making a climate-related gaffe next week as their favourite.

“Other things in that field include the betting agencies ourselves having their week on the receiving end of the outrage brigade,” said a soulless SportsBet representative.

“There’s a whole smorgasbord of horrible, reprehensible shit that’s currently happening around the country right now. It’s hard to put good odds on just one thing,”

“If you told me there’d be people down at Circular Quay shining their mobile phone light at the fucking Opera House last night in protest, I would’ve laughed. But there were – and that’s the most depressingly pathetic thing I’ve heard in a while.”

A Ladbrokes sales suitcuck then chimed in with his opinion.

“They’ve got suicide netting around the factory where those phones are made. Why don’t they protest that? Those $39 chinos they wear, those same chinos that have piss all down the front of them after being in the wind last night. How do you think things that cheap are made? By Bangladeshi slaves! Do you they care about that? No, they care about rich people advertising their horse race on fucking concert hall. This world is fucked up,” he said.

“Our favourite to cause the most outrage next week is something related to the ABC. We think Greg Hywood, the guy who drove Fairfax Media into a roadside gum tree, will probably get the top job, which in turn will piss a lot of people off. That’s our tip,”

The PalmerBet representative was standing at the other end of the function room, smelling the whiteboard markers and laughing to himself.

“You’re all wrong,” he said.

“It’ll be about the Roosters breaking the salary cap. We’re offering $1.04 on it. We’ve got the good oil.”

He then sat down on the floor and let a bit of drool slip out of his mouth.

“An Aussie Does Molly”: Gus Worland’s New Cricket Show To Showcase The Real Australian Summer

TEXT:

The nation’s favourite intrepid cricket fan is back!

That’s the message from Foxtel today after they launched their dedicated cricket channel in Sydney last night. Along with Worland, Foxtel has thrown huge amounts of money at the wall in the hopes that something will stick.

An Aussie Does Molly, Worland says, will showcase the real Australian summer – not just the cricket – but a multifaceted look at how we as a nation like to spend summer.

Hugh Jackman’s friend spoke to The Advocate this morning via telephone to discuss his upcoming programme and what viewers can look forward to.

“So basically this Foxtel producer took me and my agent out to lunch about three months ago to chat about what we could offer,” said Worland.

“Then, in like plain view of like four other diners, he takes a ten pack of MDMA caps out of his inside jacket pocket and threw them on the remains of my spatchcock! He said, ‘An Aussie Does Molly. That’s what I want. I want a show where you have to ingest like 6-700mg of molly each day of each Test match,'”

“I’ve never done drugs before so I asked my friend Hugh Jackman about it. I left him a message and he hasn’t gotten back to me yet. Anyway, I took the job regardless. Making television is in my blood. I’m looking forward to it.”

The plan has been met with controversy, however.

A number of local drug abuse groups have lashed out at the giant, faceless multinational broadcaster – saying that forcing somebody to take nigh-on-lethal amounts of molly for the entertainment of others is unethical.

But Foxtel hit back at those guitar-strumming hippies who hate uppers, saying they’ll get the bags of molly and the ecstasy pills comprehensively tested for anything bad.

“There’s no danger of Gus keeling over in Bay 29 of the MCG on Boxing Day,” said one Foxtel source.

“He’s got a heart the size of a hot water bottle. Strong as an ox. He broke the ECG machine during his annual medical,”

“Gus’ new show reflects the CSIRO’s recent findings that Australia takes the most uppers per capita in the world. What better way to show the real Australian summer than to peer pressure a polite, happy-go-lucky punter into doing hard drugs? It’s a rite of passage for every Australian. Your first kiss, first chop, first pinger. Trust me, you’re all in for a treat!”

“I’m fucked,” she said.

“Having like 2400 calories and a pint of full-fat craft beer for lunch really put the handbrake on. I can barely keep my eyes open. I was fucked before lunch, too. I hadn’t really eaten much since Sunday,”

“It’s called intermittent fasting. I like doing it after weekends so I feel a bit lighter and healthier. Also in hindsight, taking one of those Donald Trump yelling face pingers might’ve been a bum steer. I think I threw up at the pub. I haven’t done that in like 10 years.”

Julia’s boss walked past her cubical, noticed she was having a Skype call with our reporter then began to give her a very public tongue-lashing.

Louis CK Hopes You Have It In Your Heart To Find The Thought Of Him Wanking Funny Again

TEXT:

Almost one year after being brave enough to admit that he was creepy once, comedian Louis CK is hoping audiences have it in their heart to find the thought of him wanking funny again.

Following allegations from five women that he masturbated in front of them, the stand-up comedian and sitcom writer penned an eloquent letter citing how the women he did it to admired him as many of four times without even having to say the word ‘sorry’ once.

Now that he has stayed out of the limelight for almost a year, CK is hoping people can forgive him for something he never apologised for and laugh at the thought of him pleasuring his copper wire-haired and almost certainly stubby penis.

“I understand people might not want to see my shows so I’m not going to force myself upon them. I know that is wrong now,” stated CK as he donated a shirt he once wore that reads ‘Public Masturbator’ to Goodwill.

“I’m turning over a new leaf so you can find the thought of me and my ejaculating penis funny again.”

Many other comedians have come out to publicly support CK who are everyday dudes just like him but have avoided being ‘me-tooed’ purely because they aren’t famous enough.

“He’s done his time,” said comedy room runner Christian Pale.

“Ten months out of the public eye living only on the millions of dollars he amassed from his years of international stardom. What kind of PC prude doesn’t want to think about that loveable lump of ginger pleasuring himself to the thought of a woman who may or may not have his consent?”

Proud Boomer Winds Wall Clock Forward Manually Just Like He Did In The Good Old Days

In less developed parts of the nation, clocks went forward an hour for daylight savings overnight and one South Australian sexagenarian proudly let younger members of his family know about it.

Gavin Rutledge, of nearby Innaminka, told his grandsons that this morning he had to get the ladder out of the garage and take the wall clock down to manually wind it forward – just like he’s always done.

He spoke exclusively to The Advocate this morning about why things were better back in the good old days and how funny it is that his teenage grandchildren have never really had to do what he just described.

“These days the bloody clocks move forward automatically!” he said.

“That alone makes kids soft. They’ve never had to climb up on a ladder and get the clock down. You know how dangerous that is for old folks like me? My generation was just built tougher,”

“But in saying that, if I did have a tumble this morning, the grandkids would’ve been in for a shock when the came over for lunch! I’d be stiffer than a boogie board in Alberta by the time they would’ve found me! [laughs] My bloody head would’ve bounced off the kitchen tiles like a bloody squash ball! Then I probably would’ve flip-flopped around like a carp on a river bank! Bloody going everywhere! That would’ve shocked those little fucking soft cock Millennials!”

Man Saves Slice Of The Pizza He Just Devoured So He Can Say He Didn’t Just Devour A Whole Pizza

TEXT:

A visiting big kahuna has kicked his Baxter boots off in his motel room and retreated to bed with a family-size Hawaiian Meatlovers pizza from French Quarter institution, Pompe à Chiasse Pizza.

Colin Rogers added that the hubcap-sized pie came with a mango chutney swirl.

He invited our reporter into his motel room shortly after lunch today so he could watch him eat the entire thing in front of him – save for one lonely slice.

Why? Because the 28-year-old rodeo clown says he feels better mentally about himself afterwards if he doesn’t just lie down shoeless and beltless on a motel bed in plain view of a journalist eating a delicious pizza.

“While it is a high-quality pizza, eating the whole thing will make me feel guilty and put a longneck-size slug in my digestive system,” he said, wiping the crumbs off the visually-offensive eiderdown with his forearm.

“But if I leave a slice in the box and throw it in the fridge, it means I haven’t been able to finish it. When in actual fact, I could’ve easily polished it off – plus a full 12-inch Viennetta,”

“It just makes me feel better about myself. It makes me feel like less of a pig, to answer your question.”

Young Rogers then let out a large burb and turned the television on.

“Oh! Yes!”

“You wanna climb up here and watch Grand Designs with me?” he asked our reporter, slapping the bedspace beside him.

City Worker Misses Out On The Scotch Fingers Yet Again

TEXT:

“Fuck!” he said loudly enough to fill them empty break room.

French Quarter corporate lawyer Darcy Mulholland was just minutes late knocking off for afternoon tea today – but it proved just enough for every Scotch Finger in the Arnott’s Family Assortments tray to disappear.

His employers, Minter Nopeopleskills & Utz, generously put on a tray of biscuits every smoko and afternoon tea but according to Mr Mullholland, the early bird gets the Scotch finger – and that needs to change.

“Honestly, the first bloke in the room must just take the five Scotchies and fuck off,” he said, candidly.

“I got here like three minutes after the bell went and there’s just these fucking bland, wookatook-looking things sitting in the tray looking back at me. Someone’s even picked up all the ANZAC biscuits!”

“What would the fucking diggers think? This country was founded and defended on mateship. There’s nothing friendly about taking all the ANZAC bickies! If I have to have one of those oval bastards with my Dilmah tomorrow again tomorrow, I’m going to fucking snap!”

Our reporter spoke to Darcy’s supervising partner, who already hates Darcy for a myriad of reasons, about the issue the impressively unpopular junior solicitor raised with our news organ.

She was less than impressed.

Dr Wendy Greensmith SC took time out of her busy afternoon of billable hours and berating people less competent than her to speak to The Advocate in her chambers about the availability of Scotch Fingers in the firm’s break room.

“You know last week Darcy made a really big boo-boo,” she said.

“Just 40 minutes away from the deadline, I walked over to his desk to see if he’d lodged proceedings on a matter due to be heard in Federal Court. Do you know what he said? He said that he probably wouldn’t be able to get it done in time – with 40 minutes until the deadline – he chose to say that to me, the person ultimately responsible for it,”

“So I gave him a very uneloquent tongue-lashing in front of everyone then put him on his last warning. Now you come to me with his issues over the what? The fucking Scotch Fingers in the break room? Honest to God, I think I’m having a fucking stroke. The hide on that moron!”

As The Advocate could only afford 600 seconds of Dr Greensmith’s time, our reporter decided to conclude the interview there.

Crypto Investor Nearing The Point Where He Can Laugh About It All

TEXT:

Sam Boyall has today conceded that he is almost ready to have a laugh about his last twelve months.

Still in a fairly sizeable the hole, the 26 year-old-man from Betoota’s Roma Hills opened up to The Advocate about his unfortunate and rapid descent into the world of cryptocurrency.

While the last few months have been tough, Boyall says he can sort of see the funny side of the whole thing now.

The civil engineer at a local construction company in town refused to confirm or deny how much he funnelled into the fad of 2017 but told us that he would have had the deposit for the first home in French Quarter if all had worked out well.

“Yeah, I guess the whole thing was a bit manic,” he said.

“A bit like a dazed gambling spree in reality. I mean I did really like the tech in some of the projects though, and I haven’t given up hope that some of them can moon,” explained the young man who still isn’t really sure what blockchain is.

When we asked young Boyall how much his current portfolio was worth he told us he was ‘hodling’ the popular, deliberate misspelling of ‘holding,’  and a term made popular by crypto enthusiasts and investors.

“You never know, and if I sell it all off now at its current price it’s barely going to make a dent in the personal loan anyway. So I’m hanging on for now and hoping that I’ll get that Lambo one day,” he said.

Boyall’s boomer mother told The Advocate that she just hopes he has learnt his lesson.

“I’ve stopped asking him how crypto’s going and he has stopped talking about it. I hope he has learnt from the whole episode,” she said.

Boyall told us that he is hoping to be able to laugh about it all in the next couple of months.

“It’s just a little bit to raw at the moment, by maybe after Christmas.”

“This Suburb Is Still A Bit Dodgy” Says Student Eating A $9 Bánh Mì

TEXT:

If you ask Peter Dollarson which artist should be playing this year’s AFL Grand Final, he’d pensively rock back in his chair, smile to himself and say ‘Mumford and Sons’ as gentle as a warm spring breeze.

A native of Betoota Heights, the 28-year-old now lives in The Ponds – just a hop, skip and a strum of a ukulele away from South Betoota Polytechnic College.

He studies film, part-time.

Which means he’s got more time to work in a popular French Quarter coffee shop by day and a trendy, inner-Old District gastro-cocktail bar by night.

But that also means he’s perpetually broke.

“Which is why I live down here, in the real Betoota. On the wire,” he told our reporters.

“I love it. All the culture, fresh arrivals and whatnot. It’s great. You don’t get this type of authentic food say, up in Betoota Grove or the Heights. Not even the French Quarter. That place has been gentrified beyond comprehension,”

“Sad – but you can’t stop the tide of so-called ‘social progress’. I’m glad this area is still a bit rough, still a bit dodgy. Like, there’s every chance I could get mugged on the way home from the pub or – I might be able to find heroin just as easily as I would a beer?

However, The Advocate can reveal that during the course of the interview, young Dollarson ordered and consumed a $9 Vietnamese Bánh Mì, a glaring indicator that the so-called grungy suburb has nigh-on reached gentrification.

“This roll is a testament to the suburb still being in touch with its roots,” the Rolf De Heer fan said in regards to a roll that used to go out the door for $4.50 under the previous owners.

“Good Time To Buy” Says 22-Year-Old Real Estate Agent Who’s Quietly Downgraded From Leased Beamer

TEXT:

Despite all the negativity in the press over the last few days, Angus Hunt has an optimistic outlook.

With his clients that is at least.

The young man who quietly transitioned from leasing a BMW 320xi into a more affordable Volkswagen Golf this week explained that there are always people out there peddling negative stuff.

“Always going to be people spreading FUD (Fear Uncertainty and Doubt) dude,” Hunt said.

“But at the end of the day, my ability to own a different suit for every day of the week, blow it out on a Friday arvo, if you know what I mean, and rent luxury vehicles depends on people thinking the market is strong,” the man who hasn’t sold a house this month said.

The residential agent based in Betoota’s French Quarter explained that while these economists and analysts might have a point about the current climate, he’s never seen the market not doing well.

“In my experience, all these people can say what they want, but at the end of the day, I’m still out here selling blocks, making money, and making other people money,” Hunt said.

“I have read a lot of motivational literature, and I know that you can’t let negativity seep in. So I can’t be telling clients you know what, maybe it’s not the best time to buy when housing prices are at record highs and real estate is at record lows.”

Hunt admitted that while he has in fact given away the lease on the luxury car, which was an important part of making a strong impression on potential home buyers, if his sales do in fact keep going the way they are he may have landed himself in a bit of hot water.

“Just to be safe,” he said.

Here’s Why Moving The ABC To A Western Suburb Is Problematic And Toxic

TEXT:

The toxic notion that the ABC offices in our nation’s capital cities should be moved to a cheaper, less desirable suburb isn’t an old one.

Could you imagine Sydney’s Ultimo Kremlin be packed up and moved to Doonside or Parramatta like some sparsely-visited technology museum? It’s true our government could flip that building into student housing within 18 months and make more money than 1000 Brendan Nelsons.

Or perhaps Brisbane’s iconic ABC South Bank Commune be shipped out to Inala or Ipswich? Where the ‘squinters’ actually live?

Could you imagine that, though?

No, you couldn’t – and here’s why.

Employees of ‘Aunty’ will tell you that it’s critical for them to be a small cog in the inner-workings of every Swiss watch-like city around the country.

That prominent people from around the world, worth far more than you and I, often grace their hallowed grounds to be interviewed and fluffed.

An ABC out in Blacktown or Strathpine or Dandenong North would be far less attractive – simply because it’s ‘so far away’ from everything else.

And guess what. All of that is correct.

You see, the ABC attracts the best and brightest in the country – and the best and the brightest don’t drink 7/11 coffee.

To work at that high temple of journalistic and thought-provoking thought, you can’t be some middle-of-the-road colostomy bag of a graduate, you need to be the best. Which means you need to have been educated in one of four selective high schools in the country, and a sandstone university that is located roughly halfway between that school and the ABC head office. Walking distance between each.

If the ABC is out on the city fringe, in the political battlegrounds our politicians seem to perennially over-promise and under-deliver in, then the best will find somewhere else.

Somewhere else like a commercial network or worse – advertising and public relations.

Therefore it is imperative to keep our ABC far, far away from Middle Australia.

It’s problematic to have the ABC where poor people live because poor people don’t watch the ABC, they watch more aspirational television like The Block or Survivor. Sometimes the Melbourne Comedy Gala.

Shows that showcase a life slightly better than their own.

People who work at the ABC don’t want for anything, they’re the human embodiment of absolute contentment. Next to Brendan Nelson.

But they will want for something if you make them commute more than an hour to work.

Man Tries And Fails To Forget High School

TEXT:

Local man Ryan Devlin (27) is in for another long and mostly sleepless night as he once again tries and fails to forget high school.

Ten years after graduating from Betoota High, the investment banker feels like his high school blunder years are simultaneously a lifetime ago and a horrible reoccurring nightmare he relives daily.

“I asked out Bella in front of the whole class,” mused a sleepless Devlin, lying next to his longtime girlfriend.

“I wish I could move on.”

Despite now having a well-paying job, worldly experiences and a loving partner, Devlin can’t seem to rid himself of the intense shame he feels when he remembers scoring an own goal during his year 9 soccer tryouts.

Devlin hopes his visible achievements will do well to impress his peers at his upcoming high school reunion, as long as no one brings up the two weeks he spent walking around like Jack Sparrow after seeing Pirates of the Carribean 2.

According to Devlin’s girlfriend Teresa Thomas (26), her boyfriend usually avoids discussing high school, preferring instead to talk about any other time in his life when he didn’t wear a fedora.

“He got good marks in the end, I don’t know why he’s so embarrassed,” stated Thomas.

“Could have something to do with his high school band. They were punk-ska but that’s all he will tell me.”

Devlin hopes his reunion may provide him with a chance to reconnect with others who may feel the same way as him, including other members of his former band Howard Coward Killerz.

For Fuck Sake! Someone Forgot To Tell The ARU Marketing Pigeon The NRC Started This Weekend

TEXT:

After a busy morning of doing absolutely fuck all, the all-star marketing team at the nation’s peak rugby union body have sheepishly revealed that even they’ve forgotten that the National Rugby Championship (NRC) is currently underway.

“Someone forgot to tell the fucking pigeon about the NRC,” yelled an angry employee.

It’s believed the pigeon took the morning off and is currently loitering around Hyde Park looking for bread crumbs.

“Whoops,” said another team member.

“We’ll get on it right away. The NRC is a key market for us and a great competition that fosters rugby talent. We obviously didn’t forget it on purpose,”

“After the Bledisloe and this upcoming match against, ahhh, is it the Springboks? No Samoa. Yeah, that’s right. The lead up to that has just really burnt us out. And then we’ve basically been put on notice by Twiggy in the west and the Shute Sheild in Sydney. Trust us, you’ll be hearing about the NRC by close of business. You might even buy a ticket to a game! [laughs]”

Closer to home, The Advocate’s sports editor, Imran Gashkori, trialled for the reigning championship team Queensland Country earlier this year – and was glad he didn’t get the call up in the end.

“Nobody knows about it,” he said.

“And I’m not that keen on playing in any level higher, so why bother? I enjoy playing grade for the (Betoota) Porpoises, but,”

“But ah, yeah. I trialled for the team and even I didn’t know the season was underway. I guess that’s why they say NRC stands for Nobody Really Cares.”

The Advocate reached out to some of Rugby Australia’s board but all of them were still on cloud nine after finding out Rod Macqueen and John Eales know their names.

Prospective Honey Buyer Unsure Which Pot Of Lies To Have In Pantry For The Next Four Years

TEXT:

The average pot of honey sits in a Betoota pantry for roughly four years – which makes the buying process all the more important.

Recent developments in the honey industry have sent shockwaves of distrust through the consumer markets with millions of Australians now questioning whether what they’re buying is actually honey.

Cameron Ashley, a French Quarter resident, said she binned her last pot of honey about a month ago as it was almost done and rather mouldy.

But a recent craving for nature’s heroin has forced her out to her local shops to buy some more today.

Speaking candidly to The Advocate just a short time ago, the lethargic Cancerian said she wanted to know if what she was buying was the Real McCoy.

“I’m going to have this honey for a long time,” she said.

“So selecting a pot of lies that might actually be real honey is important to me. I don’t want to get stuck with a few hundred grams of petroleum byproduct and flavouring. These recent developments in the honey industry have only made the choice harder,”

“When a normal person buys honey, it’s an investment for the future. Nobody hoons through a kilo in just a few weeks. If they do, they’re either a bear or a Type-2 diabetic. So you can understand my dilemma.”

However, when asked if she’d ever consider buying a local honey from a Betoota producer, the 27-year-old explained she would but only if it was cheap or as cheap as the imitation honey at the supermarket.

Fuck Boy Makes Seamless Transition Into Fuck Manhood With Purchase Of Black Puffer Vest

TEXT:

“It doesn’t matter who the Prime Minister is or which party is in power, my life just sails on ahead,” he said.

“But what does matter in my life is the decision I’m about to make now.”

Lying on his parent’s couch this morning, Alphie Stevens had four tabs open and a credit card sitting on his chest.

“Patagonia, North Face, Kathmandu or RM Williams?” he asked our reporter sitting opposite him in the living room of his parent’s leafy Betoota Grove home.

The 23-year-old pursed his life.

Many of his friends and peers from The Whooton School, one of the Diamantina’s most exclusive and needlessly expensive school for boys, have already selected Kathmandu.

“I’ve always been an individual but I’m not sure if I can pull off a North Face. That’s more of a girl thing, you know. Yankees cap, nice top, black North Face puffer vest, black yoga pants and some fresh kicks. Don’t get me wrong, that really puts the doughnut in the tea for me, I just wouldn’t wear North Face,”

“So it looks like RM Williams, the Bush Outfitter. Italian-owned, Bangladeshi-made. Wouldn’t old Reginald be spinning in his grave? Anyway, a label is a label.”

And with that, young Alphie broke free of the shackles of fuckboyhood.

No longer bound by his innate ability to ghost his way out of casual relationships. Replying to texts is still low on his priority list. Is it 2 am on a Saturday morning yet? You’ll know when it is because Alphie will shoot out a text to someone he hooked up with 11 weeks ago asking if they’re still awake.

Now, he says, he’s a fuckman.

“I’m looking forward to experiencing even less consequences for my poor judgement,” he said.

“The black puffer vest is more than just nylon, polyester and child slave labour, it’s a way of life. It screams, ‘I don’t care if you were at the bar before me, I’m going to order anyway,’ and things like that,”

“It’s a licence to be a bag of shit. You might as well call me Colostomy Bag Stevens now because I intend to spend the rest of my life living like one.”

Surgeon Let Down Once Again After Patient Thanks God For Successful Operation

TEXT:

Many other surgeons had written off Beryln Colt as a lost cause.

The 67-year-old’s lifelong love of heavy cigarettes, sunbathing and cured meats had caught up with her and it seemed that her time on this hellscape of a planet was about to come to a premature end.

Enter Associate Professor Angela Brock-Jones, who spoke briefly to The Advocate this morning via telephone.

Ms Colt was offered a lifeline by the popular Brisbane-based instructing surgeon, who said she’d seen patients in similar circumstances before.

“I remember being out on smoko one morning, while I was sunning myself in the designated smoking area, when I was thumbing through Lancet I came across a case in Canada that stood out to me,” she said.

“So I downloaded the instructions on how to do the operation, rang old Ms Colt and the next week, we were in theatre.”

That was five years ago.

Today, Beryl is a 72-year-old with a new lease on life – who thanks God every morning for her blessing.

The Betoota Heights Bowling Club Treasurer told our reporters this afternoon that while she acknowledges the expertise of the men and women who cured her of her terminal illness, it was God who ultimately came through with the bickies.

“I’m not even that religious,” she said.

“But I know a miracle when I see one. God saved my life and I pray every day to His kingdom on high for all my good health and graces. I’m even prepared to kill in His name. All he has to do is ask.”

However, Professor Brock-Jones has lashed out at patients who feel obliged to thank a 2000-year-old wizard who lets bad things happen to good people all the time.

“Just once,” she said.

“I’d like someone to maybe be like, ‘Oh, Professor, thank you for taking time out of your busy day to operate on me and in turn, saving my fucking miserable, pathetic life from the jaws of death,’ but no. It never comes,”

“I try to not let people die all the time and fucking God lets really good people die in horrible ways all the time. I read about some guy who drowned in concrete the other day. Fuck that. God let that happen.”

Malcolm Turnbull Lets Hair Down During Candid ‘Humans Of New York’ Appearance

TEXT:

Former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has taken time out of his busy first morning in New York City to appear on popular blog ‘Humans of New York‘ ahead of his six week holiday in the Big Apple.

Speaking candidly to photojournalist Brandon Stanton, who founded the project in 2010, Turnbull reflected on his past association with the city as well as the events of the past few weeks.

“I first came to the country as a happy-go-lucky merchant banker,” said Turnbull.

During his halcyon days as Managing Director of Goldman Sachs Australia, the enigmatic Scorpio would often visit New York for business – and pleasure.

“New York was a hell of a place in the 90s. If you had the money, you could get anything you wanted. It was actually fucked,” he said.

“Back then, I had a really fun time here. I even bought a place on the island. Anyway, I was the king. Then I became king of Australia but I recently lost that job. Regicide, brother. It’s a bitch,”

“Well, I kind of deserved it. I got this cunt Tony binned halfway through his term because of his penchant to shit the bed socially and politically. But then he got his mates to come back and bin me. Anyway, it is what it is. I’m going to Two Hands to have a flat white now. Then we might go to the Brooklyn Brewery, have a few there then watch the sun go down at the Wyhte.”

Lucy Turnbull and her mildly popular husband are due to enjoy a six-week break in the area, where they expect to catch up with old friends and do other things Australians like doing in America like shooting handguns and letting off fireworks.

Japanese Scientists Harpoon God Particle To Better Understand It

TEXT:

Scientists at the Tokyo Institution of Applied Physics have divided the scientific community with their revolutionary study of the enigmatic God Particle which was made possible by spearing the particle with a massive harpoon.

Known in the scientific community as Higgs boson, the God Particle is hypothesised to give mass to all elementary particles in the observable universe, which is why the Japanese government made the controversial decision to use harpoons to slaughter the particles for research purposes.

Research leader Kenji Sato PhD stated that the particles are killed humanely using harpoons with grenades attached and is a necessary thing to do for both the purposes of science and tradition.

“Iceland and Norway are doing it too,” stated Sato.

“You don’t see them being protested against when a God particle is murdered in front of its baby – for research purposes.”

The protestors Sato is referring to are activists from the group Particle Shepard who have taken to standing between research scientists and particle colliders in order to protect the lives of a non-sentient particle that may or may not actually exist.

At present, the Tokyo Institution of Applied Physics has released a statement saying they will not be ceasing their research into understanding the God Particle and if anyone has a better idea on how to study something that doesn’t involve impaling it with a barbed metal spear to let them know immediately.

Personal Trainer Posts Photo Of Car That’s Definitely Not His

TEXT:

Personal trainer Liam Powell (28) took to Instagram earlier today to share the spoils of his labour, by posting a photo of a car that is definitely not his.

The image captioned “Name’s Powell, Liam Powell #z3 #PowellFitness #Powell100DayChallenge” was posted earlier today and features Powell flexing his bicep muscles in front of a convertible BMW Z3 roadster that probably belongs to a neighbour or member of his extended family but is definitely not his.

“Who does he think he’s fooling?” asked high school friend Belinda Smith (28).

“He can’t afford a second-hand beamer. He has one client and still owes Nimble a packet from his last pyramid scheme.”

Sceptical of Powell’s perceived success, Smith questioned him in the comment section by asking ‘Yours?’ to which Powell replied with three consecutive sunglass smiley face emojis, making it clear beyond doubt that the car is definitely not his.

“Not his. Not even a nice vehicle.”

Powell denies Smith’s claims which according to him are malicious and untrue.

“James Bond drives one of these bad boys!” stated Powell next to a vehicle he definitely does not own.

“In GoldenEye, Brosnan at his finest. Fights Sean Bean.”

According to Smith, while Powell is correct about Bond driving a Z3 in Golden Eye (1995), she is quick to point out Bond drives an Atlantic Blue model and not the black model in Powell’s photo, adding that none of it matters anyway as you don’t even get to see any of the gadgets get used in the movie.

“It could be the damn car from the film and it wouldn’t change the fact that it’s definitely not his car.”

Girlfriend’s Half-Arsed Promise To Share The Driving Eventually Waived After Three Hour Nap

A local woman has today set a new Guinness World Record in the narcolepsy category. Kate Smove (27) was out cold within the first 15 minutes of a 5-hour road trip she was embarking on with her boyfriend, it has been confirmed.

According to Kate it wasn’t even on purpose.

“Well I’d actually promised him I’d drive, but as soon as I got in the car it was like I’d dumped 10 Valium”

“He’s always getting cut at me for making him drive, so to actually be rewarded for falling asleep feels pretty good.”

The Advocate reached out to Kate’s boyfriend to get his opinion on snoozegate.

“She could have her leg in a bear trap with the sound system blaring Rammstein and I’m sure she’d still be out in under half an hour”

“She can sleep through a five hour road trip, sometimes longer. Just me and my thoughts”

While Kate’s boyfriend may be unimpressed with the whole scenario, there’s actually a science behind the car ride catnap.

Head of the CSIRO’s Sleep division, Dr. Petier Binkerton, explained it in detail earlier to The Advocate. 

“There are multiple elements that play into carcolepsy, but the main one is the movement of the car replicating that of being in the womb, it immediately transports people back to that dark wet place that they felt so safe.”

Carcolepsey or not, Kate has set the bar now and we understand that she already has her sights set on breaking her own world record, we’re yet to hear back from her boyfriend on how he feels about this.

“Actually no, that’s unfair. I remember when I had my first drink. I’m just grateful that social media wasn’t around when I was a teenager.”

Twiggy Forrest Presents Tony Abbott With His Very Own Welfare Quarantine Basic Card

Just days after being made Scott Morrison’s special envoy on Indigenous Affairs, Tony Abbott has received his Quarantine Welfare Basics Card from the programmes biggest proponent, Andrew ‘Twiggy’ Forrest.

At a special afternoon press conference in Canberra, the billionaire and the former prime minister embraced before Twiggy palmed Tony the cashless debit card.

“Now don’t you go trying to spend all this on smokes and piss!” laughed Twiggy as the rattle of camera shutters filled the room.

“Oh! I’ll try not to! Just bread, milk and cordial for this busted old boardrider!” replied Abbott.

“I’m running on for Walgett tomorrow at the Koori Knockout so I’ll be taking it easy tonight!”

Forrest then made a jibe at the Howard-era Health Minister for playing rugby league, a game for thugs and lowlifes, when he could be playing halfback for a team in his rogue rugby union competition.

The pair of old friends decided to take a number of questions from the growing crowd of reporters.

A popular, bright and naively left-wing journalist from the ABC asked them both a detailed question about the possible ramifications of the Welfare Quarantine Basic Card, to which Mr Abbott said he was committed to working with Scott Morrison, while Twiggy decided to play 8 Ball pool on his cracked iPhone 4S.

“Hey, ah, if you want a sure bet. Roosters over the Eels tomorrow. My Manly boys are not spoon material. They are good guys,” said Abbott.

Man’s Plan To Ration Takeaway Butter Chicken For Three Nights Fails

Tony Johns lied to himself last night.

With his girlfriend away on a work trip for the week, the 26-year-old electrician from the Golf Course Estate decided to treat himself.

However, while he planned to treat himself, he planned to do it reasonably responsibly.

So, on the first night of her departure, Johns headed down to Indian Palace to order himself a large takeaway container Butter Chicken, some naan and a serving of rice, which would last him at least the next couple of days.

Takeaway in hand, barely able to contain his excitement, the Dolphins Reserve Grade centre burst through the door into his living room and ripped into the spread.

The left alone for the week male planned to survive on the Butter Chicken dish for at least three dinners, cooking up some rice each night to make it last.

However, sitting slumped on the couch last night, full as a butchers dog, with the dirty plastic and paper strewn across his coffee table, Johns asked himself why he is like this.

“Sitting there, at the point where I am almost needed to go out the back and throw up like a dog whose gulped down too much chum, I was filled with self-loathing,” Johns said.

“I’m still coming to terms with it.”

“Did I lie to myself? Am I just a fool who genuinely thinks he has self-control? I don’t know, all I know is I still feel fucking shit this afternoon. I think it’s going to have to be something healthy tonight like a takeaway stir fry with heaps of veges or something.”

Tony Abbott Stopped By Police For Absolutely No Reason Whatsoever For The First Time

TEXT:

Respected Manly community elder Tony Abbott told media in Canberra this morning that he’s just received his first Operating A Motor Vehicle While Aboriginal ticket since being made Scott Morrison’s special envoy on Indigenous Affairs earlier this week.

Mr Abbott, who was once the prime minister, described to journalists how he was just going about his business in his predominantly white suburb when all of a sudden, the police pulled him over.

“I was going well under the speed limit,” said Abbott.

“All I was doing was driving about the Northern Beaches with a carload of my mates. We might’ve had an open container of Light Ice or something but everybody does that, don’t they? Well, they did when I was a young man!”

“Anyway, the police were actually very hostile toward me and my friends. They drug and breath tested me – twice – and it turns out, one of the boys had an unpaid jaywalking ticket and they arrested him. After the shakedown, the cops defected my car because one tire was a little bit worn. What the hell is going on?”

However, in his capacity as special envoy, Abbott says he’s come to understand that it’s not an uncommon occurrence for Indigenous Australians.

“Terrible,” he said.

“No reason at all. There was no logical explanation for it. You know what? I bet I get pulled over again when I go visit friends in Red Hill this afternoon or try to get into a pub in Kingston or Manuka tonight,”

“If only there was something we could do about it – or somebody to voice my concerns to.”

Queensland Man Under Fire After Shaving Son’s Head For Wally Lewis Book Week Costume

TEXT:

A photo of a young boy dressed up as Rugby League immortal Wally ‘The King’ Lewis – complete with a bald head – for his Brisbane school’s ‘book week’ has gone viral.

The picture of the youngster was seemingly shared online by his father, who has admitted to shaving the boy’s head to make him look more like the Emperor Of Lang Park.

In just seven hours since being posted to the Euphoric Queenslander Memes Facebook page, the photo of the young boy has been commented on 800,100 times and received more than 1.2m likes.

The dad responsible for shaving his son’s head to look like Wally Lewis’, Shane Welcke, says his son wanted to initially go as his favourite former Brisbane Bronco’s player Palmer Wapau, but the two of them decided against the idea.

The son, Tim (10) says they decided to go with his dad’s favourite player of all time – but agreed that he would have to shave his head to make sure people fully understood who he was.

“Dad has posters of Wally Lewis everywhere,” says an ecstatic Tim.

“I was so excited when he shaved my head… And we won!”

Tim Welcke’s book week outfit has been voted ‘Best Costume’ in all of Queensland, and it looks like the haircut is here to stay.

“He wants to keep, but I don’t think the missus would like it being a permanent thing,” laughs dad.

“But fuck me, I’d love him to keep it. Long live the king”

Organisers of Book Week have once again requested that Australian families adhere to the actual concept of book week and stop dressing their children up as current and former sports stars.

Brisbane Girl At Sushi Train Briefly Considers Getting Something Other Than Chicken And Avo Rolls

A Brisbane woman spent a little bit of time last night contemplating whether to step out of her comfort zone.

Phoebe Husic (26) from Brisbane’s Inner Western Suburb of Indooroopilly entertained the concept in her head during an impromptu outing to a local sushi train with a work colleague.

Sitting alongside her colleague and fellow teacher, Husic thought that maybe today was the day to pull a new plate from the train.

However, watching the plates meandering around, it only took a few moments for Husic to realise that it was probably just best to stick to what she knows.

Nodding to herself, pleased with her decision-making ability, young Husic pulled 3 Chicken and Avocado Roll plates from the train in short succession.

Speaking to us outside the restaurant moments after finishing her meal she explained her thought process to us.

“I did sort of want to try something new, but after the weekend, I’m not sure my palate was ready for potentially gross fishy plates,” she said.

“So I just steered clear and followed the tried and tested path.”

“Besides, Chicken and Avo is a match made in heaven. I feel like eating some weird looking plates is a recipe for failure when I’ve got the perfect rolls right there in front of me.”

Abbott Joins Local F45 Gym In An Effort To Tackle Turnbull Related Self Esteem Issues

TEXT:

After another tumultuous month, Tony Abbott, the country’s former Prime Minister has today decided to turn things around. 

For a couple of years, the Liberal Party’s Chief White Ant has confirmed that his life has been filled with negativity and conflict. 

The conservative MP from Sydney’s Warringah Electorate told The Advocate today that enough is enough. 

In an exclusive interview with our humble outback paper, the spiritual leader of the right faction of the Liberal Party explained that he has been struggling with his self esteem since Malcolm Turnbull rolled him in 2015. 

“Ever since Malcolm did me over, I just have struggled with my confidence,” Abbott said. 

“Sniping and undermining Malcolm were the only things that made me feel better about myself. So I began chasing that. Leaking whatever I could to the press. Saying I supported Malcolm before going on 2GB and talking shit. It just felt so good.” 

However Abbott said that he is tired of living that way. 

“I have been watching some inspirational videos on the computer, and talking to some of the important figures at Church, and I have decided that it’s time to get off the pity potty,” Abbott said. 

“So I thought F45 would be the perfect thing to get me back on my feet and get my confidence back now that the smooth-talking gun for hire from Wentworth is on the way out.” 

Abbott told us that he had his first F45 session this morning, and he is almost ready to start posting on social media and acting like he is better than everyone who doesn’t attend the fitness chain.

Scott Morrison Confirmed As The Oldest Known Living Scott

TEXT:

After a dramatic week saw Scott Morrison become the next Prime Minister of Australia, the nation was left wondering;

Isn’t ‘Sco-mo’ pretty old to be named Scott?

Today, The Advocate can, in fact, confirm that Scott Morrison is the oldest man named Scott in Australia.

After hours spent in with the Australia Bureau of Statistics, our reporters can reveal that at the ripe old age of 50, the country’s newest Prime Minister is 10 years clear of the next youngest Scott.

Due to technical problems on the ABS’s Lenovo PC’s, it took The Advocate some time to actually get into the system for long enough to avoid the computer crashing, but it can be confirmed that the next youngest man with the same name, is Scott Ripps from Coffs Harbour in NSW’s Mid North Coast.

Social Demographics expert Ashley Barclay from the Royal University of Betoota told us that Scott is quite a new name.

“It has been a very common last name in this country due to its obvious origins. However, as a first name, it’s only emerged over the last couple of decades and can usually be attributed to men driving Holden Thunders and eating meat pies for breakfast,” Barclay said.

“So yes I wasn’t surprised when you told me that he is the oldest living Scott in the country.”

Coke Releases New ‘Hint of Winfield’ Variety To Corner Lucrative Early Morning Smoko Market

TEXT:

In Coke’s latest move of their rebrand campaign titled “Everything Is Fine,” the soft drink giant has launched Coke with a Hint of Winfield, a beverage aimed at the lucrative worksite breakfast market.

Observing how the rising cost of cigarettes has impacted those who want to start their day by pairing a carcinogenic lung buster alongside a drink with the nutritional value of Dulux paint, Coca Cola Amatil decided to combine the best of both worlds in a high sugar beverage enriched with the smokey delight of nicotine.

“Australians know Coke goes with everything,” smiled CEO Alison Watkins.

“It goes with pizza, fun times and with that first morning cigarette before you start your day on site”

Watkins confirmed the new variety of Coke was the result of 17 years of research wherein scientists observes that people drinking Coke while having a cigarette appeared to be the happiest people on earth despite the fact that they were forced to listen to talkback radio at work all day.

“It doesn’t matter how much you lost punting over the weekend, how bad your team played, or how much of a fuckwit your foreman is, when you have Coke with a hint of Winfield, everything is alright!”

For the health conscious smoker, Watkins alluded that a Diet Coke with Winfield variety would be available later this year, to be replaced by a Coke with Winfield No Sugar variety about eight months after that.

Bureau Of Meteorology Confirms Wind Is The Shittest Kind Of Weather

TEXT:

In news out of Betoota today, it has been confirmed that wind is the shittest and it can fuck right off.

Thats according to a new report by the Bureau Of Meteorology.

In a country known for its share of extreme and sometimes devastating weather events, residents agree that wind is still the one that can well and truly go and fuck itself.

The overwhelming sentiment has again been established this week as the brisk August westerlies arrived, bringing nothing but leaves, pollen and Ekka carnie germs to Brisbane.

“Wind brings nothing good to the table” said Bardon resident Aaron Frame. “Other types of weather have a purpose or at least a silver lining. The wind just blows around like a dickhead and fucks everything up. It’s basically the coriander of weather events”.

Danielle Sweeney, from Kallangur, agrees. “Yeah fuck the wind. Even if you don’t leave the house, you can hear it’s evil howls and its deeply unsettling. Plus my lips are dry and my sinuses are burning. Wind is definitley the shittest bro”.

The current forecast from the weather bureau reads: “this shittiest of shitty winds will fuck itself off in a few days. Asshole.”

Report: Winx Doesn’t Understand Or Give A Fuck About How Amazing She Is, Just Wants A Carrot

TEXT:

A report released to has revealed legendary racing mare Winx is in fact a 7-year-old horse and that she just wants to eat carrots.

After recording her 26th consecutive win on the weekend in a race named after her, the praise for Winx has hit dizzying heights, including a commemorative postage stamp.

As she carries the weight of an entire industry on her back, congratulatory messages have been flooding in from across the world, with dignitaries and fans who passionately cheered her down the Royal Randwick turf, showering “Darling Winx” with praise.

Trainer Chris Waller broke down in tears telling Winx how much she means to his bank balance.

Though as it turns out through this report, Winx, being a horse, doesn’t understand the english language and she “sure as fuck doesn’t understand the racing industry”.

The report concludes that “Winx is a horse. It is quite clear in our findings that she doesn’t give a fuck about any of this fanfare and she would much prefer to be at home, hooking into a nice, crunchy carrot”.

Other findings in the report suggested that she likes having her tail brushed and enjoys being patted down the nose.

Grammatically Incorrect Restaurant Name Good Indicator Of High Quality Cuisine

TEXT:

Restaurants specialising in foreign cuisine will serve a far more authentic and superior meal if their name is grammatically incorrect, it has been confirmed.

Research has revealed that establishments with names that make no sense – including misplaced words, interesting words, or words not commonly used in the english language – are 100% more likely to serve far better and authentic meals to their customers.

“It makes it easy” said Ryan Patterson, an avid Uber Eats user. “You flick through the Asian options and just look for the most cooked name. You see something like ‘Korea Chick Magnificent Hello’ and you know you’re good”

For those looking for the bricks-and-mortar experience, a few other factors are to be taken into consideration if you want the best meal.

These include:
– The shops decor must make as little sense as it’s name
– The windows must display highly faded photos of the food on the menu
– There must be no sign of any graphic design or marketing consultancy
– Absolutely no online presence (except for some bad reviews on Yelp)

If your local incorrectly-named restaurant ticks all of these boxes, congratulations. You’ll never need to eat anywhere else, ever again.

Investigation Launched Into Who Sparked The Chain Reaction Of Yellow Bins On An Off Week

TEXT:

A local Brisbane street collective has launched a thorough investigation into which resident put their yellow recycling bin on the kerb on a non-recycling collection week.

The Froome Street Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has begun gathering evidence and interviewing residents, in order to identify the culprit, who’s actions sparked a chain reaction of yellow bins being dragged out onto the kerb only to be dragged back in, still half-full, the next day.

In the midst of the confusion, landlines were running hot up and down Froome Street, as residents were unsure wether to trust their neighbours, or trust their own internal calendars.

“The yellow bin was only half-full” said Troy Reynolds at number 52. “In hindsight, something definitely didn’t feel right. It was too soon”.

Geraldine Keogh, number 33 and who is heading the inquiry, said that even though she prides herself on her punctuality, she wasn’t ready to risk missing a week. “I put the black one out, and noticed that it was an even fifty-fifty of people who’d also put out the yellow bin, to those who hadn’t”.

“I called Sandra next door and then Peter on the other side and then popped over to speak to the young couple across the road” admitted Mrs Keogh. “None of them could provide a definitive answer, although they all decided that they would probably just put theirs out anyway”.

“I don’t want to point any fingers, though I am a little bit suspicious of that young couple. I don’t much trust young people”.

More updates as they come to hand.

Running Becomes Local Toddler’s Favourite Pastime Just Days After Learning How

TEXT:

A Betoota Heights 21-month-old has ushered in a new era of worry for his parents this week after learning how to run.

According to Chester Willis’ Mum and Dad, he’s now opting to run everywhere he goes – just because he can.

“It seems only yesterday he was barely able to roll over,” said father, Glenn.

“Now he’s speaking, running and organising things by size, shape and colour. That latter has got me a bit jumpy, I hope he grows out of that. It’s pretty spooky coming home to find all the cans in the cupboard lined up on the living room floor with no labels on them. I was hoping for baked beans yesterday morning but ended up having to have asparagus spears on toast,”

“But yeah. He’s running everywhere we go now. He sleeps like a rock now too. The wife is a bit nervous he might run into traffic or somewhere unseen. Fair, but you don’t want to helicopter the boy.”

Amanda Willis also took time out of her busy afternoon looking after the spritely bastard to speak to our reporter about the perils of owning a toddler that runs flat out everywhere.

However, she was far less dramatic than what her simple husband had painted her out to be.

“I’m thinking of getting one of those leashes,” she said, stealing a rare moment to have a John Player Special.

“Because it’s actually next level how much Chester can run. There’s no slowing him down either. But at the same time, I’ve heard putting a kid on a leash is more harmful to their development than second-hand smoke,”

“He’ll be playing for the Dolphins one day like his old man did. I’d hate to see him end up in the debate club or worse – the theatre. So I’m torn. What do you reckon?”

Our reporter shrugged then let himself out before being asked another question about his future.

Report: How Good Are Movies

TEXT:

A recent report by anyone with a couple hours to spare is that watching movies is so sick, and the best way to spend an arvo.

Movies with good actors that you’ve seen before and like watching in movies were found to be the best ones, especially if the movie you are watching appears to be really popular but you’ve only just heard it.

All genres of movies are good, with even the sad romance ones having their moments, as with the ones where heaps of people get shot by an action hero.

The ideal scenario for watching movies has been found to be really rainy days with thunderstorms in the distance. On a massive TV, while lying on a couch. Possibly with some choccies.

The report found that movies that start with the stars that fly across the mountain top at the start are particularly good, but so is the one with the lion – and also the one with like the film studio and it’s all orange.

Also the movies that start with the guy sitting on the crescent moon. They are also good. But heaps of movies are good and some will surprise you at how good they are.

Man With Absolutely No Spatial Awareness Wonders Why Everyone Around Him Is An Arsehole

TEXT:

Known locally for his ability to meander slowly down a footpath and to sometimes just stop walking for no reason at all, a local dead shit has confided in The Advocate this morning about one aspect of his life he finds difficult.

Everybody Stacey Carter meets on the street is an arsehole.

“It’s hard to explain,” he said.

“Whenever I’m out walking somewhere or even when I’m driving. People blow their horns at me and sigh audibly as they powerwalk past me like they’re in some sort of hurry. It’s unbelievable. Slow down! Life is long! There’s no need to be rushing people,”

“But honestly though. I must be a magnet for arseholes and pricks because everywhere I go, I seem to be surrounded on all sides by them. Inundated if you will.”

However, colleagues of Mr Carter say that whenever they’re out getting lunch with him or whatnot, he exhibits all the signs of having absolutely no spatial awareness at all.

There used to be local laws in Betoota’s French Quarter district where slow walkers and people unable to mesh with a crowd were legally able to be punched in the back of the head.

Those laws were repealed in 2016, leaving people like Mr Carter free to be spatially reckless.

“It’s incredible,” says coworker Brandon Brathen.

“He stands in doorways, gets to the bottom of escalators and just stands there. He fucking pinballs all over footpaths and does it slowly. The list goes on,”

“And then when he drives. No blinkers, an almost criminal inability to merge or have any concept of merging in general. I told him it works like a zipper and he just looked at me with his big dumb fuck head like I was speaking fucking Danish! Fuck! It just makes my blood boil!”

“He’s a great agent, though. Can and will sell a property above reserve.”

ABC Fact Checker Explodes After Being Tasked With Checking Everything Bob Katter Said Today

TEXT:

A supercomputer at the heart of ABC’s Fact Checking Unit has reportedly exploded this afternoon after a staff member gave it the task of fact-checking each part of Bob Katter’s press conference today.

Around lunchtime today [AEST] Katter spoke to the media today in Cairns, despite it being a sitting day for both Houses in Canberra, where he made a number of claims about everything from the foundation of the City of Cairns, his own personal heritage and the nation’s immigration policy.

Over the course of roughly 20 minutes, the Member for Kennedy allegedly made upwards of 400 claims that needed to be verified.

About an hour after Katter was done talking, a taxpayer-funded employee of the public broadcaster finished typing the speech into the Fact Checking Computer and pressed ‘enter’.

“That’s when the fire alarm went off,” said the head of ABC’s Fact Checking Unit, Harriet Fuller.

Ms Fuller spoke to The Advocate via public telephone a short time ago.

“The whole building shook violently. My green tea spilled all over my desk. I looked around at my coworkers and we all traded worried looks. Then the office started to fill with smoke and the fire warden came in and told us all to get the hell out,”

“I believe the supercomputer exploded after one of my staff asked it to fact check everything Bob Katter said today. They really should’ve broken it up into smaller bits. I don’t know much more, I’ll get back to you later.”

From what witnesses have been able to describe, a large hole was blown out the north side of the ABC Kremlin in Ultimo, in the heart of Sydney’s soulless district.

Emergency crews are currently attending the scene with no reports of casualties at the time of print.

Mememakers Set For An Influx Of Content With Release Of New Puppet Movie

TEXT:

Mememakers on the internet have rejoiced today with news of The Happytime Murders Puppet movie being released. 

Home to many important things like, online news, videos of people hurting themselves and memes, the internet is set for a bit of boost with the movie’s release. 

A meme, defined as ‘an image, video, piece of text, etc., typically humorous in nature, that is copied and spread rapidly by Internet users, often with slight variations,’ often gains traction on the back of current trends, affairs and popular culture. 

Although enjoying a short, but storied history, puppet characters have featured heavily in meme stocks since their initial release on social media. 

‘Kermit Drinking Tea’ is one such puppet meme which has cemented itself as an iconic image over the last decade, and the internet and it’s content creators are bracing for a storm of fresh content. 

Social Media Professor from the Royal Betoota University, Anderson Park spoke to The Advocate about what we can expect in the upcoming months following the release of the film.

“Typically, we will see the first ‘memes’ lurking around on Reddit and 4chan. All the nerds will be posting images and quotes from the film, and the cream will eventually rise to the top,” Park explained. 

“After that happens, the cream will seep out onto mainstream platforms like Facebook and Instagram, before it eventually dies on NRL, Tradie and Car related meme pages,” he said.

“But that’s a long process, so in general meme stocks will receive a real boost for the next few months, and I’m looking forward to what the internet can create.”

“Don’t Talk To Me About Droughts” Says Unremarkable City Worker Who Hasn’t Mated Since 2008

TEXT:

There’s not a person who’d believe that Dennis Rutland had a packet of Snickers Pods for breakfast this morning – most only would if they saw it.

But he did and that’s far from the worst thing he’s shovelled into himself in the hours after first light.

By any measure, today was just like any other day for young Dennis.

The 32-year-old professional cobbler said a cheerful farewell to Stella, his 9-year-old partially-blind and grimly-incontinent Pekingese bitch, then pulled the door of his Betoota Heights studio apartment shut.

Speaking uncomfortably candidly to our reporter this morning at the D45 Bus Stop on Jones Avenue, Rutland said he was growing tiresome of hearing about the drought – because it hasn’t rained on his farm in almost exactly ten years.

“The last time I had sex was the night Steve Hooker won gold in the high jump at the Beijing Olympics,” he said, to a complete stranger.

“That was the 23rd of August 2008. It’s now the 14th of August 2018. You do the math. So don’t talk to me about droughts. It hasn’t rained on my back paddock wild oats since my third year of college,”

“And to make it worse, I told one mate about it and then suddenly everybody knew about it. They even make jokes about Hooker, saying I should visit a hooker. I’m not one to judge but I’m just not that type of person. The irony isn’t lost on me, however.”

Our reporter smiled politely until the next bus came, which wasn’t even the right bus, but she got on anyway.

Farmer Who Started Destocking A Year Ago Says He’s Right For Drought Relief Thanks

TEXT:

A local grazier has taken to social media today to announce that he doesn’t need or want any drought relief at the moment because he identified that times were getting tougher over a year ago.

In a lengthy post to Facebook, accompanied by a picture of him and his young family, Wallace Dangerford of Dangerford Pastoral Company Pty Ltd out on the Dunespring Development road explained that though he feels bad for other farmers doing it tough he’s seen on the news – he’s not one of them.

And he’s proud of it.

“It [drought] forced me to re-evaluate my future plans, at least for a few seasons,” he wrote.

“So when we lambed last spring, I elected to take basically all of them to market. If I had a bit of pasture, I probably would’ve kept most of them but the early warning signs were already there,”

“I also put money away that I otherwise would’ve spent on something stupid like a jetski or 10 days in Mooloolaba over summer. It’s basically Longreach-by-the-sea in January, anyway. Not missing out on much by taking a year out from the Australia Day stripey shirt gang,”

“What I’m trying to say is, is that I don’t need any drought relief because this isn’t my first drought and it won’t be my last. We had some over the best seasons in living memory before this current drought started. That’s all I’m saying.”

Dangerford then went on to say that he hopes it rains soon.

Science Behind Glass Kettle In Office Kitchen Still Amazes City Worker Every Time She Sees It

TEXT:

With a knowing 11 am nod over the cubical wall at her best work friend, Emma Douglas received one back – which meant only one thing.

It was tea time.

Joined in the kitchen by Emily Carter, the two French Quarter public relations professionals entertained themselves with small talk about the weekend.

Which events they went to.

Which events they’re looking forward to going to this week. What they think the events will be like.

Events.

But as the conversation slowly relented to the growing rumble of the kettle, Emma’s mind wondered from whatever Emily was talking about to the bubbles building at the bottom of the jug.

The office kettle at their boutique, bespoke and artisan public relations firm is made of glass – thus lifting the veil on what is typically hidden from view.

“How do they do it?” her inner voice asked herself.

“I’ve seen it a thousand times but each time, I cannot look away. If a fire is a bush television, then a crystal clear hot water jug is an office one.”

As the boil grew increasingly violent, Emily too stopped speaking and focused her attention on the kettle.

The two keep cups were at the ready beside the jug, green tea bags waiting for destiny.

With a great crescendo of chaos, the entire kettle began to rock to and fro as the boil neared the end.

“It’s so amazing how they do it, huh?” offered Emma.

“Yeah. It’s crazy.”

And with that, they made their tea then went back to vaguely answering emails – and began wondering which local eatery is going to get their $10 for a lunch special today.

The directionless and mildly afraid 27-year-old Virgo laughed as he explained how he didn’t even leave his house yesterday on account of how hungover and scat he was.

“I still feel like I’m dead on the inside,” he said.

“Today, I’m just going to try and look as busy as possible. Hope nobody asks me to do anything too taxing.”

As the big brown and red Betoota Bus Lines Mercedes moaned violently up the hill to the bus stop, Francis’ answers got shorter and shorter until our reporter got that he no longer wanted to talk.

However, they ended up sitting next to each other on the bus, where our reporter observed him looking at Patagonia gear and Anaconda catalogues.

He then researched where he could pick magic mushrooms in the wider Diamantina area.

Self-Described Writer Decides To Procrastinate At Local Cafe For A Change

TEXT:

Freelance writer and full-time son, Jamie Pike (26) decided to mix things up earlier today and procrastinate in a local cafe.

Taking his densely stickered laptop to French Quarter cafe, Leafy Blend, Pike opted to boldy set aside his screenplay about a misunderstood writer and focus heavily on what is happening on reddit and 4chan today.

Strategically sitting on a corner table where no one could see his screen, Pike mucked around for a while, finding out what member of Friends he’s most compatible with on an online quiz and watching X-Factor fails from eight years ago.

During this time witnesses report that Pike sneakily left a centimetres worth of coffee in his cup in order to give the appearance that he hadn’t been sitting there for five hours, using the free wifi to download all eight seasons of Mad Men.

“Yeah I just needed a break hey, it’s been a hectic couple of months,” he stated, referencing his rigorous schedule of writing and masturbating.

“Thought I’d come hang out here and procrastinate for a change. I like it here, and they like that I come here.”

Owner of Leafy Blend, Wendy Griffiths states that while she values all customers, Pike is the exact sort of customer she is hoping to rid her business of.

“He is here every day, purchases a $3.50 coffee and sits by himself at a table for four until we close and he still asks for the wifi password every fucking time,” spat a distraught Griffiths.

“Plus, if he was really writing, would he need to ask for the wifi password?”

According to Pike, his recent journey into the world of procrastination should come as a shock to Griffiths as she now no longer gets updates about his screenplay.

Leasing Agent Laughs In Face Of Peasant Renters Asking For Their Bond Back

TEXT:

French Quarter real estate agent Belinda Rowe (46) has received a formal complaint from a group of tenants who allege she openly laughed in their face when they asked for their bond back.

The peasant renters were tenants of a rental property Rowe oversees until last week when they moved out the last of their succulents, milk crates and bong residue, before dumping everything else in the alley behind the terrace house.

On their way to their new residence in a pre-gentrified part of town, the tenants stopped in to ask Rowe about getting their bond back which is when the real estate agent laughed in their unwashed faces.

“[Laughs] Fuck me you guys are funny!” exclaimed Rowe.

“That’s good. Haha, fuck me, that’s so good.”

One of the disgruntled commoners claims they are going to take their formal complaint further once they find their laptop charger and are connected to the internet at their new property in about 6 to 8 months.

Rowe claims she is not the slightest bit worried about the previous tenants getting their bond back, referencing her final inspection of the property.

“I don’t know what they did but I’m pretty sure the kitchen didn’t have carpet when they moved in. It appears to be 90% cat hair and 10% red wine stains.”

“There is evidence to suggest someone was using marijuana on the toilet and every surface seems to have doubled as an ashtray at some point. These heathens will get their bond back when they stop making horrible life choices.”

According to Rowe, she feels no remorse for laughing in the face of the provincial renters as none of them were even on the lease to begin with.

Made famous by Captain Starlight, who was rarely seen without his Longreach pocket square, the tradition has been carried on by stockmen of countless generations.

Which makes Preston’s act of cultural sensitivity all the more touching.

“I made sure to pick myself up a pouch of Port Royal last night before I flew in,” said Preston.

“The intoxicating aromas of rum and wine blended generously with a fine cut sweet Virginia tobacco is hard to pass. I used to be a Drum Cowboy back in the day, I even used to subscribe to the school of a filterless White Ox,”

Work Friend Promoted To Real Friend After Weekend Hang Out

TEXT:

“You know what,” he said.

“I know who loves the beach. Gary. Fuck it, I’ll give him a ring and see if he wants to come.”

One of Sam Hatton’s favourite Sunday rituals is a quick dip in Lake Betoota followed by a nice, hearty brunch at the nearby Yacht Club.

But this Sunday past was especially difficult for the 28-year-old buyer’s agent.

Surrounded by his real, non-work related friends at the Betoota Dolphins Leagues Club on our town’s picturesque southside, he was innocently enjoying a few drinks and laughs when a drug detection dog came in through the entrance, his little tail wagging.

In a panic, he had to eat four low-quality MDMA capsules that were burning a hole in his pocket all Saturday.

“So needless to say,” he told our reporter.

“I was in a very fragile and dark place yesterday. I still am to be fair, but I’m on the way out of the tunnel now,”

“So when I thought a nice frolic and swim down at the Lake would sort me out, it dawned on me that having some company would make the whole experience more palatable.”

Enter Gary Tucksworth.

For a few months now, Sam and Gary’s work friendship has grown from strength to strength.

Normally, agents working in the same agency are trained to systemically undermine and loathe each other, both professionally and socially.

But these two, friends say, are different.

“When Sam rang me up early on Sunday morning, I didn’t know what to think,” said Gary.

“But when it wasn’t work-related, and he just wanted to see if I wanted to go to the beach with him, I was surprisingly pleased,”

“When he asked me to put some sunscreen on his back and legs, I was kinda wigged out a bit, but I went along with it. I was apprehensive at first but I ended up having a great time.

Onlookers say the two were seen running up and down the beach, hand in hand, in a heartwarming display of friendship.

From all accounts, the friendship has graduated from one that only operates from 9 to 5 to the point where they follow each other on every social media platform they have.

Stand-Up Career Looking Serious As Profile Pic Changes To Performance Shot

TEXT:

Facebook friends of the substitute teacher and hobbyist comedian Harry Rovedi (27) have been notified that their friend’s career in comedy is looking more promising as their profile picture has changed to a photo of them performing stand up.

The photo in question was taken by a friend of Rovedi’s while he was onstage, likely performing one his jokes about his English second language father, experiences on Tinder or the funny things he says to charity workers.

Updated during prime social media hours, Rovedi changed his profile picture at 7:55 pm on Thursday to a photo of him smiling while holding a microphone, his face lit by a stage light, reinforcing the idea that his stand up is getting pretty serious guys.

“I didn’t know things were moving so fast for him,” stated Rovedi’s aunt Emelia.

“Good for him. Great job.”

He hopes the attention his new ‘trophy profy’ has received will notify people that his stand up career is progressing as he continues to open for other comedians on his level and considers eventually MCing an event.

The photo has so far generated 78 Facebook reactions, including 61 likes, 16 love reacts and one lone plane reaction that Rovedi is reportedly secretly stoked about.

Comments on the photo so far have included “looking good,” “FUNNY MAN,” and “when’s your gig at the Apollo?”

Rovedi is yet to respond to the comments, as he wants people to think he’s busy with his income absorbing career in comedy.

Pundits claim the photo is helping him cement his reputation as the guy from his high school that got into comedy and will add an extra boost to his podcast which mostly features comedians from the local comedy scene discussing comedians from the local comedy scene.

As the photo continues to grow in popularity, Rovedi hinted there may be more to the image than it first appears.

“Well, the good thing about the photo is that you can’t see the audience,” stated Rovedi.

“People needn’t know there were six people in the audience who were all comedians. That’s neither here nor there.”

Local Boomer’s 15 Cents Shopping Bag Outrage Redirected Towards ‘They Day’ Campaign

TEXT:

Logistics expert Oscar West (65) has had to pause his outrage over reusable plastic bags after hearing about ‘They Day,’ a day of observance for gender-neutral people who do not identify as male or female.

Although he’s yet to meet a gender-neutral person, West has been outraged by the idea that there are people who want to spread awareness about the daily adversity they face, so much so he’s completely forgotten to be mad about reusable shopping bags.

“According to Lyle Shelton the Bible says there are two genders,” stated West from a sagging armchair.

“It’s fine if someone doesn’t feel like a man or a woman but keep it to yourself and stop trying to ruin our kids.”

So serious is West’s outrage for ‘They Day’ she has cleared his schedule of posting angry comments on Coles and Woolworths Facebook pages in order to spend eight hours expressing his disdain for gender-neutral people.

“It doesn’t matter if you think you’re not either [male or female] you are as God made you and I can tell which one you are anyway so there!”

According to West, he’s not a bigot, just an ordinary Australian who values time honoured traditions such as fitting everyone into one of two categories and the continued production of an unnatural material that will break down many millennia after the last person with opinions like him has died.

“I just don’t get it, which fills me with rage,” he said.

“Not since I was told I couldn’t climb Uluru next year have I been this disappointed!”

Office Dog’s Vomit Set To Dissolve Slowly Into Carpet Until Owner Comes Back From Lunch

TEXT:

“What the fuck is that?” asked Georgia Frost as she came back into the accounts department.

The drone of office chairs wheeling back over the plastic carpet protectors filled the room.

“Oh Jesus Christ!” said one faceless, robot of an accounts director.

“That’s fucking disgusting!” yelled another.

Liberty Bell, the office dog, had just vomited in the middle of the room – as if she was meaning to do it on purpose.

The medium-sized Beagle-mix was now sheepishly hiding under her owner’s standing desk.

“For fuck’s sake, Liberty Bell. What the hell did you eat? It looks like a bunch of stock cubes soaked in a melted rainbow paddle-pop!”

The four city workers shot each other looks.

Who was going to be the hero and clean up the vomit?

As the seconds turn to minutes, it seemed that nobody was going to be stepping up to the plate.

The vomit was going to slowly but surely dissolve into the high-trafficked and rapidly-browning carpet until Liberty Bell’s owner came back from lunch.

Around 2pm this afternoon, her owner did return from lunch and was immediately greeted by greasy looks and a room-temperature slurry of dog breakfast.

Silvio Ernesto, the man who stands as he uses a computer to do things in return for money, immediately scolded Liberty Bell – who had since forgot she even vomited in the first place – and went into the shitters to get a ream of TP to begin the cleanup.

But much to Silvio’s chagrin, he discovered Liberty Bell has also shit at the foot of the men’s room door.

“Fuck,” he said.

“Abolish Centrelink!” Chortles Uptown Boy Who’s Never Needed To Go Inside One

TEXT:

“One hundred and fifty billion,” said the weak-chinned suit.

“That’s with a ‘b’ not an ‘m’. That’s what Centrelink costs the Australian taxpayer each year. 8 in every 10 taxpayers give their tax straight to Centrelink,”

“It’s time to abolish it and force everyone into work. No excuses.”

Henri-Paul Hanneford’s sentiments were echoed by his coworkers from Rochford & Williams Investments as they sat around the long table down the Harlot & Concubine Inn.

The Financial District institution is often awash with local powerbrokers of an afternoon – and today was no different.

A veritable gaggle of private school boys, casual franking creditors and uptown homeowners were spilling out of the hotel this afternoon.

Even though the ASX 200 finished slightly down today.

However, none were as entertained as Henri-Paul and his mates while they played Devil’s Advocate this afternoon.

“Has anyone ever been inside one?” laughed Henri-Paul.

From the head of the table, an arm went up.

With a wry smirk, senior portfolio manager Hunter-Ponsford Gilbert-Hopscotch explained to his fellow colleagues that when he was back at university, he once tried to apply for AusStudy so he’d have a bit of pocket change.

“Turns out my father doesn’t do a very good job of hiding his assets!” he said to growing, violent laughter.

“Because they knocked me back! Citing that because we have a beach house, my parents were too asset rich for me to get the welfare!”

Henri-Paul’s eyes rolled back into his head with sheer ecstasy, wetting himself as he giggled uncontrollably.

“Then I said, ‘But sweetheart, it’s not my fucking beach house is it, now? It’s my fathers. I’m broke and I need money, isn’t this what this economic handbrake of a government agency is for? I’m hungry! Feed me! I don’t want to work!”

Nearing death, Henri-Paul and the other senior money men were finally able to catch a breath.

As the laughter slowly died down, Hunter-Ponsford smiled and shook his head.

“What a place,” he said.

“And…”

“Turns out when you have a baby, your wife needs to go there to get her maternity leave! As if labour isn’t degrading enough!”

Henri-Paul then had an enormous, joy-induced aneurysm and slumped headfirst into his rapid warming pint of draught Peroni.

Pub Manager Laughs In The Face Of Bartender Who ‘Needs To Go Early’

TEXT:

On this gorgeous ANZAC Day afternoon in our cosmopolitan inland metropolis, a popular French Quarter bar manager got the laugh of his life after one of his barmen asked if he could go early.

Just as another wave of pub crawlers pour themselves through the front doors in their $299 off-the-rack two pieces.

“Ha!” laughed Michael MacDingwall.

“You’ve got to be fucking kidding, mate. There’s no way you can go early. It’s four deep at the main bar. It’s one of the biggest days of the year!”

But Sam Klimtapus didn’t care.

Yesterday morning, he’d made a promise to his friends that he’d be ready to head out on the town for his college’s ‘Cheeky Tuesday’ goon-of-fortune night by 5pm – some four hours before his swing bar shift was due to finish.

“Mickey,” he said.

“I’ve got an exam tomorrow and I need to study for it. Please let me go, it’s a weeknight. It’s not that busy. You can save on wages and Frazer [owner] will be happy with you.”

MacDingwall laughed again.

“Shut up, you idiot. My hours are none of your business. And I couldn’t give a flying fuck about your exam. In fact, mate can you head on onto the floor for me and do a sweep?”

As a bar supervisor, Sam felt he was above working the floor.

He tells friends who aren’t cut from the hospitality cloth that the floor is typically reserved for transient backpacker workers and fresh hires out of high school.

For peasants that haven’t yet worn the sheen of their RSA competency card.

To a man of Sam’s bartending experience, it is the ultimate insult.

“Chop chop, Sam. We’re almost out of pots and schooners,” Mickey said, laughing.

Sam frowned, got a wet rag out of the sink and headed out onto the floor.

Mickey chuckled to himself.

“What a fucking moron. Asking to go early. What does he think this is? Bush week? Does he think the Diggers asked to leave Ypres early?”

Witnesses say Sam left twenty minutes after his shift was over, covered head to toe in sweat, liquor and broken dreams.

Michael’s shift ended at 3pm with the safe down a respectable $94.50 at change over.

Clothes Enjoy Fourth Wash Cycle Since Friday As Useless Man Forgets To Hang Them Out Once Again

TEXT:

“Fuck,” he said firmly enough for his neighbour across the hall to hear.

A socially-popular Betoota Heights man swore as he apologised to his clothes today after forgetting to hang them out to dry for the fourth time since last Friday.

“For Christ’s sake,” he said to himself.

“These socks are already sticking to the soles of my shoes. What am I going to do?”

Miles Greenie did the only thing a 34-year-old confirmed bachelor could do in that situation – he turned the socks inside out then put them on upside down so the sole of the sock was now running up the tops of his feet.

“This will have to do until tomorrow.”

Speaking to our reporter this afternoon, Greenie explained that he left a note for himself so he wouldn’t forget.

“I’ve also set a reminder on my phone,” he said.

“Which I’ve been told still works even if your service has been cut-off. I’m currently at war with VodaCuck because they sent me an outrageous $450 phone bill after I got back from overseas,”

“But yeah. Can you actually ring me but and remind me, just in case?”

J.R. Holeman & Sons Bookkeepers in the Old City District are currently offering $1.23 odds that Mr Greenie’s clothes will endure a sixth wash cycle tomorrow.

Local Hopes For True Love Dashed After She Pulls Out The Crystals

TEXT:

A local man has today had his renewed hope for true loved dashed when a visit to the home of his new love interest revealed an alarming stockpile of crystals, curiously placed in several locations, in and around the house and its contents.

Matt Barton, 29 and former inside centre for the West Betoota Warriors, said he felt his “heart sink in his chest”, when he was confronted with the rocks.

“I was pretty shattered”.

“I really thought I could’ve been onto a winner with her” he admitted, referring to Paris Langer, Betoota TAFE hairdressing teacher and owner of the crystal collection.

“She drank beer, loved Thai food and her Godfather is Wayne Bennett. She seemed really well-adjusted”.

We asked Mr Barton if there was any chance of seeing past the moonstone, amethyst and rose quartz.

“Nup. Look I’m pretty open-minded. I’m a Freddy Fittler fan and I appreciate a good meditate as much as the next bloke, but the rocks just give me the heeby-jeebys. They belong in the ground, not on top of the bloody microwave”.

Matt also says that it’s hard to talk about any problems he has in health or in life, because the conversation will inevitably divert to talk of rocks and mars and smelly smoke.

“I just want to talk some things through sometimes, try and solve a problem, have a partner to lean on, ya know?”

“I don’t wanna be sitting amongst a bunch of shit that should be in the yard, drinking some awful tea, at risk of burning myself”.

“Just give me a cuddle, a block of black forest and some Seinfeld thanks”.

Freezer Bananas From 2014 Still Waiting Patiently To Be Turned Into Bread

TEXT:

On a lazy Sunday morning back in 2014, Dennis Rutland got up off the couch where he was watching some figure skating at the Sochi Winter Olympics, went into the kitchen and noticed the soft buzz of fruit flies in the corner of his eye.

“Shit,” he thought to himself.

“Those bananas are on the way out, I’ll freeze them and make banana bread at a later date.”

The past four years have seen many changes in the world – from reality TV stars becoming presidents to the end of the QLD Maroons dynasty.

Those five bananas in Dennis’ fridge have bared witness to all of them.

This morning, in a brief conversation with our reporter down the Gumnut Cafe on George Road, the 29-year-old city worker said he was reminded of the banana’s presence when he went to defrost some chicken last night.

“It made me think,” he said while eating a slice of banana bread.

“Those bananas have been in my freezer for ages. Four years if I remember correctly. Can I still make some b-bread with them – or have they gone off?”

“If you or any of your readers know, can you please tell them to get in touch? In this day and age of minimising waste, I’d hate to throw out some perfectly good produce, you know?”

When asked if he intended to stop lying to the bananas and just turn them into bread, Dennis said he’d consider it this weekend – providing he gets the green light as to their quality.

Exotic Fish Tank In Pokies A Testament To All The Cash Lost In That Room

TEXT:

A Galaxy Rasbora, Red Spot Severum, and even the endangered Nosferatu Labridens are just some of the exotic fish that call the 2×1.5 metre fish tank in Betoota’s Royal Hotel home.

While the origins of these fish remain rather suspicious, one thing we know for certain is that the exotic school has been funded entirely by punters.

Catching up with the Advocate earlier, Royal manager Sven Cochorone, outlined exactly how much cash comes through the pokies each week and just how they ended up with Australia’s second largest collection of exotic fish – second only to the Great Barrier Reef.

“We see about $150,000 go through the pokies each week and as you can see we’ve reinvested a lot of that money in the pub”

Sven was right, the pub was in top order; freshly painted interiors, no sticky carpets, large high-definition televisions, renovated bathrooms with built in AI, in fact, it almost seemed like Sven had done what any average bloke who’d come into a lot of money would do – start spending money on unnecessary shit.

“Haha [sic] yeah you’re right, we’ve got more cash coming in than we know what to do with”

“That’s why I added the fishquarium.”

“It’s my pièce de résistance. Look at those majestic creatures, so beautiful”

“Little Larry here cost me $10k, had to have him smuggled in from Myanmar with a – oh actually never mind”

“Don’t want the cops to cut off my fish supply.”

Sven’s ‘fishquarium’ is a testament to the amount of cash Betootan punters pump through the pokies each week and with his sights set on a Pelagic Octopus, we can only hope people don’t kick their gambling addictions before then.

Country Person Heading Home For Weekend Forgot How Fucking Cold It Gets

TEXT:

A 20-something man who’s spent the past 3 years softening his country coat on the eastern sea board has today sent his body into shock after stepping out of a cosy small plane and onto a frost covered Betoota airstrip in nothing but an Academy t-shirt and chinos.

Lionel Adams (24) grew up walking the streets of Betoota with bare arms for the majority of his youth, despite temperatures often falling well below zero during the cooler months. However, today, that Lionel is long gone, what remains is nothing but a weak-skinned blow-jn that can’t cop it in the country. 

“Fuck me it’s cold!” Lionel stated obviously to our t-shirt wearing reporter.

“I forgot how cold it gets here!” 

“How can you be in just a t-shirt?” 

“We used to rock short sleeves in winter when we were 18, but there’s no way I could do that now!”

While many assume Betoota to be a constantly warm climate, the environment in the Diamantina is often compared to that of the Gobi Desert.

As we are a typically dry patch of land, there’s no moisture to trap the sun’s heat, so once the sun goes down temperatures drop dramatically.

Most people who grew up in Betoota are aware of this ecosystem, however, it’s the ones who venture inter-state who forget just how fucking cold it can get. The lesson here is, don’t forget where you came from.

Man Walking Barefoot Around Woolies Shouting Into Phone Doesn’t Want You To Get Him Fucking Started

TEXT:

Deverill ‘Wapjohns’ Slacks is under the pump, witnesses say.

Striding headlong through the magic doors at the Betoota Heights Woolworths, the 28-year-old partially blind Old City District Casino croupier couldn’t even find the time to end his seemingly high-stakes phone call before getting out of the car.

“Mate,” he prefixed, reefing a basket from the stack near the entrance.

“Don’t get me fucking started on the cunt. He has to be the dumbest fucking sucked-mango-seed-looking-cunt god has ever put fucking breath in!”

The irate Virgo was shouting this into his smashed iPhone 4S, which he won in a drunken game of Go Fish in 2014.

He was also well within earshot of young mothers, their old-basketball-skinned mothers and their bedwetting offspring.

“Anyway, like I said. I can talk about how many times that gibbering bag of month-old-sun-dried-hummus has shit the bed until the FUCKING cows come home, cunt, but I won’t. Don’t get me started, mate,”

“Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Nah, fuck him, mate. Yeah, righto then jooga, I’ve gotta run. I’ll speak to you about the dough-banging prick later.”

Mr Slacks then let out a sharp, earth-shattering cough thanks in part by his penchant for unfiltered cigarettes.

After a short moment of contemplation and the fact that it’s Friday, he filled his basket with a heavily-sweating roast chook, a family-size punnet of pasta salad, a six-pack of white bread rolls, a metric half-kilo of generic-brand margarine and enough smokey BBQ sauce to drown a Shetland pony in.

However, at the self-service checkout, he apparently told the computer that everything was, in fact, 2.3kg of unwashed potatoes.

“Sorry, This Is On Trend Now” Says Girlfriend Cutting The Bottom Off Her Boyfriend’s Jeans

TEXT:

Right before his goddamn eyes, James Carmichael could only watch on as his life partner cut the cuffs off his favourite $9 Rivers jeans with a pair of blade shears.

Last winter, he wasn’t even allowed to wear them outside the house because they were ‘Dad Jeans’.

This winter, they’re the latest fashion trend sweeping the Simpson Desert – albeit with a few choice alterations.

“Hey, what’s going on in here?” asked the 28-year-old as he walked into his bedroom.

Standing over the bed, Sofie Rokmellen was going to town on his old jeans.

“I’m sorry, Rudie. But this is in fashion now so these jeans belong to me now.”

James was given the nickname ‘Rudolph’ in high school because of his perennial red nose and the fact that his eyes are so far apart, they might as well be on the side of his head.

He wanted to say something, not about the jeans, but about the love of his life using the nickname his bullies used to crush him in an almost deaf-mute existence.

But he didn’t.

He spoke to our reporter a short time ago as he took the bins out to the roadside. Though he’s been living opposite our reporter for close to a year, this is the first conversation they’ve had.

He detailed what happened next.

“Hey babe, you could’ve at least asked me!” he said – in a tone with just enough jest to prevent an argument about how wrong he is.

“Yeah, I know! Sorry! But you never wear these and I thought it’d be cheaper if I just started wearing them! Hope you don’t mind!”

“We can go shopping for new jeans for you on the weekend!”

He thought about that for a second.

As he was now starting to fill out quite grotesquely as most sedentary young men do approaching 30, he thought of the horror that was about to befall him.

“Am I supposed to pour my fat legs and barge arse into a pair of skinny jeans like they’re a pair of piping bags? Huh?! Then am I supposed to give some over-friendly-$19-an-hour cunt three hundred Australian pesos for them?” he said, looking down at the recycling bin.

“Fuck, man. Life is hard. At least she’s happy, I guess.”

The polite but comically meek reindeer then smiled at our reporter from across the street, threw a melancholy shaka then went back inside.

Kate McClymont Learns She Can Only Investigate Dodgy Tradies, Hoons And Neighbourhood Disputes From Now On

TEXT:

Popular Fairfax investigative journalist Kate McClymont returned from lunch this afternoon to find a yellow envelope waiting on her keyboard.

In it were details of where her position as the last shining beacon of true investigative journalism was going to be heading after the merger.

Moments ago, Kate spoke to The Advocate from the Sydney Morning Herald’s second story payphone using her personal phonecard.

“They asked me if I’d like to start working as the ‘Editor-at-large’ of A Current Affair from December. I told them I’d think about it,” she said.

“But I’d only be allowed to investigate hoons, dodgy tradies and neighbourhood disputes in low-socio-economic areas in my capacity as a journalist. They even suggested I have my own ongoing segment on the show called ‘Kate’s War on Hoons’ – something to mull over, I guess,”

“They made it clear that rugby league scandals were now off-limits. No more ICAC-related stories. No more CCC, either. But the real clanger, get a load of this, they want me to start including more colloquialism to my articles such as ‘Straya’ and ‘Chazwazza’. It is what it is, it could be worse.”

Never-the-less, our reporter spoke to A Current Affair host Tracey Grimshaw who said the whole ACA team was looking forward to having all of McClymont’s Walkleys on display out in the foyer like they’re Cannes Lions at a second-tier ad agency.

But Grimshaw was quick to tell our reporter that her desk is only big enough for one.

“If they want us to merge, they’ll have to call up Charlie Teo to stitch us together because I’m not going anywhere,” she said.

“Charles Croucher had a crack at trying to knock me off my perch. I had him shipped off to Canberra for that act of attempted regicide,”

“Aside from that, I can’t wait to work with Kate. She’s one of the very top journalists in the country. I once heard she choked out Peter Stefanovic with a Macbook charger – something everyone here at Nine has dreamed of doing at some stage!”

Gay Community Say Their Bar Is Essentially Just A Hen’s Party Function Centre Now

TEXT:

The close-knit French Quarter gay community has lashed out today at the constant stream of maids-of-honour booking Hen’s Nights at their local waterhole.

The Sex Cauldren on Rue Langue de L’homme has been a gay institution for almost a generation – up until now, says community LBGTI leader Cecil Freidman.

“That bar was a safe, inclusive space for the wider gay community in town,” he said.

“But recently, almost every night of the week, it’s awash with half-pissed women clip-clopping all over the dance floor in their last-season Jimmy Choos and Estée Lauder,”

“I don’t want to sound like an arsehole but can you please fuck off to somewhere else? This is our bar and there’s literally fucking hundreds of places around this shit heap of a desert community that you can go to for your Hen’s than in our fucking Sex Cauldren!”

Mr Freidman’s sentiments were echied by the management at The Sex Cauldren, who say they’ve taken the feedback from the community and are now looking to restore a bit of order.

Popular bar manager Oli Desantis-Cook said they have noticed how much the Hen’s Nights have detracted from the vibe of the place.

They support limiting – or even banning the number of Hen’s parties the venue would host.

“You know, this place is what it’s always been. A place that we can call home away from home,” they said.

“How would you like it if the boot was on the other foot? How about if each time you plodded on down to your local pub after work in your $300 fuck boy polyester suit for a few cold ones and a slap, there were a couple dozen gay blokes asking you to dance every five minutes?”

“Yeah, that’s what I thought.”

Comprehensive Study Of The Fashion Industry Finds That It’s ‘Fucking Pointless’

TEXT:

An in-depth and comprehensive study undertaken by the CSIRO has concluded that the fashion industry, on the whole, serves no purpose.

In the report, the nation’s peak scientific authority detailed that close to 90% of what happens at fashion shows is merely there to entertain our nation’s ‘bored bourgeois’.

Speaking to the media this morning from their home in Canberra, Australia’s least-fashionable city, CSIRO spokesperson Hyacinthe Redblade said that after taking all facets of the industry, the only reasonable conclusion was that it’s ‘fucking pointless’ and ‘largely redundant to the lives of everyday people’.

“Some of the shit you see [at fashion shows] is pretty crook,” they said.

“If nobody in their right fucking mind would wear it, then why are we looking at it? So we can pat some gronk with a shit haircut and a Prahran drawl on the back?”

“We studied the fashion industry for about a week, we had FTV on Austar playing in the staffroom the whole time. No self-respecting scientist here could be caught dead in any of the shit we saw,”

“If you know what purpose the fashion industry serves, please keep it to yourself because nobody fucking cares.”

The popular researcher then called an end to the press conference before saying the next tax-payer-funded study will be into why Channel Seven is so racist.

Groom-To-Be Spends Entire Session With Wedding Planner Pretending To Care About Things

TEXT:

“Should we have drinks on the lawn first for a bit and then bring the hors-d’oeuvres out? Or just bring them out at the same time?”

Lewis Greenbridge wasn’t listening as he stared blankly out the window at two magpies dancing up and down a power line.

“Babe!” elbowed his bride-to-be.

“What do you think?!”

His mind came back into the fourth-floor office the three of them were lounging in.

“At the same time. People will be hungry,” he said slowly.

But that was the wrong answer.

The wedding planner sat opposite Lewis and Amanda Redpath sighed and pursed her lips.

Just before the planner was able to speak, Mandy explained to the idiot that some people might miss out on hors d’oeuvre if his ‘fat family’ made it there first and ate them all before everyone was there.

He said she was right and agreed with her opinion of what was going to happen.

Mandy smiled and patted him on the back while the wedding planner took down some notes.

They both knew he didn’t really care, they just wanted his nod in case it all went to shit later on down the track so they’d have somebody else to share the blame.

And he’s OK with that, he says.

Earlier this afternoon, young Lewis stood with our reporter in the line for the SlingShot ride at the Rue Putain Jardin Fête in the French Quarter.

The 28-year-old was alone and he had a mild buzz going.

“Yeah man, it’s true,” he said – rolling a cigarette in plain-sight of children with wealth-related gluten allergies.

“I just go in there and agree with everything. But you know, it’s not like I’m really paying for any of this shit. Like, her old boy is spending big on this whole shebang. She’s getting a flower wall that my dumbass cousins are just going to have to throw in a dumpster like an hour after the whole thing’s over,”

“Call me crazy but I’d rather the old bastard get us a new Falcon or something? You know? Anyway, do you want to come with me on the SlingShot? I’m too scared to go by myself.”

Our reporter did ride with the bloke and held his hand the whole time.

He left soon after without providing any context as to why he was there.

“Yeah Splendour Was Great” Says Colleague Returning To Work With A Thousand-Yard Stare

TEXT:

The clinking of stainless-steel on porcelain was all that kept Julie Proctor company in the office kitchenette this morning as she stared blankly out of the fourth-floor window.

She was making her third Nescafe Gold of the morning.

Speaking exclusively to The Advocate this morning, the senior project manager at Hutchenson Builder’s South Betoota office said her moment of solace was broken by a coworker coming into to make his own coffee.

“Hey!” said Mark Rawlins, also a senior project manager at the company that built Brisbane.

“How was Splendour? Did you see Kendrick do a shoey? How rank is that! Huh?”

He’d just spent the weekend bushwalking and camping with his fiance in the Lake Bindegolly National Park.

But Julie didn’t hear him.

She was still looking out the window, her ears still ringing.

Flashbacks raced through her mind. Seeing bands she’d always wanted to hear. Even Franz Ferdinand impressed the 28-year-old.

“What was that?” she said, her brain pouring back into reality.

“How was Splendour?” he repeated.

“Oh yeah, it was great,” she laughed.

“Kendrick was mad. Lorde was also great but it was too quiet but I guess I couldn’t really hear anything because I had alcohol poisoning on the first night,”

“First night fever, hey?”

She then told our reporter that Mark asked if she was OK.

Assuring him that she was, they finished making their coffees in silence.

“See you at 3 for the monorail contract meeting,” he said.

Julie nodded and went to say something but nothing came out.

School Boy Impresses Classmates By Pretending Mouth Condensation Is Cigarette Smoke

TEXT:

A local 10-year-old has this morning cemented himself as the popular kid amongst his classmates by pretending to smoke a cigarette while waiting at the bus stop.

It’s understood that, Aayden Anderson, who picked up his smoking techniques from his pack a day father, held a Fad Musk Stick between his index and middle finger and proceeded to mimic the actions of smoking. Where he won the crowd over though was when he breathed out ‘smoke’ – which was actually just condensation from his breath.

This visual trickery occurs when a person’s exhaled breath mixes with cooler outside air and the relative humidity (RH) increases. If it can reach 100%, then breath condensation will commence – which is exactly what has lead to Aayden’s dart depiction success.

The Advocate caught up with Aayden and his classmates after their 1.5hr commute to Betoota Public School, where it seemed the trick had yet to lose its appeal.

“Ohhh haha [sic] it’s sick! Come have a cigarette with us” pestered one young boy. 

“It’s not actually a cigarette don’t worry” 

When asked what inspired this faux rebellion, Aayden informed us that he was just doing it to be more like his dad – who, he thinks, always has friends coming around and it’s probably because he smokes.

“Oh, I just seen dad doing it, he looks really cool and he’s popular so I thought maybe that would help me.” 

While it’s usually adorable for a young boy to impersonate his dad, Aayden’s dad is actually a hectic druggo and we don’t think following in his footsteps is necessarily the right way to win over classmates.

Hatred Of Loud Motorbikes The Glue That Holds Local Community Together

TEXT:

Standing on the footpath outside their favourite cafe, Blanche and David Hickmore have just strengthened the bond with other members of their affluent Betoota Valley community. Not for some neighbourly reason, but because an unnecessarily loud motorbike has just roared past and momentarily inconvenienced their conversations.

Without saying a word, each person at the cafe stopped what they were doing and stared at the motorbike as it rode off into the distance. It’s understood that before turning back to their individual lives, the neighbours all shared a look that said: “that is so unnecessary, what is someone like that even doing in our neighbourhood and thank god he’s fucked off”.

While seemingly a lot to share with one look, Blanche explained to the Advocate that looks like that are the glue that holds their community together.

“If it wasn’t for the loud motorbikes, we wouldn’t be here having this conversation”

“Everyone’s hatred would be channelled towards us”

“We’re the outsiders in Betoota Valley, we’re a Volvo surrounded by Mercs [sic]”

“So, yeah, while we’re grateful for the motorbikes, we have to hate them to fit in.”

It’s understood that loud motorbikes are up there with the top community binding adhesives, with bitching about yappy dogs and people who leave the bins out a close second.

The Advocate is currently tracking down the rev head bikey to see if he’s aware of his impact to the rich community. Although it’s pretty safe to say in the meantime that he does not give a shit.

90% Of Office Cleaner’s Job Is Wiping Up Backsplash From Thai Lunch Specials

TEXT:

A local office cleaner has today found herself wondering what the hell she is doing with her life after wiping up what looks like laksa from the communal kitchen for the 5th time today.

Simone Yilmaz has been working in Bearnst & Long for over 3 years and there hasn’t been a day go by where she hasn’t found herself in this very same situation. And it’s made her wonder, is she working for a corporation of highly intelligent human beings responsible for millions of dollars, or, is she cleaning up after 30 floors of pigs?

The Advocate caught up with Simone after she finished unclogging a drain filled with shredded Pad Thai noodles.

“I don’t know how much longer I can deal with this. I’m supposed to be taking care of the whole building but I spend 90% of my time doing this shit!”

“I have a university degree and I’m here cleaning up after these pigs.”

Bearnst & Long employees don’t seem to be willing to change their habits though, as one laksa stained male employee explained.

“Give up $9 Thai lunches? Oink are you fucking kidding oink haha”

“You can’t buy the materials for that much, let alone the time you’d have to put in to making it”

“That cleaner’s just gonna have to deal with it, because we ain’t giving up shit!”

It’s unknown whether or not the cleaner will ever be brave enough to quit her job from hell, or just how many more noodles it’ll take to break her.

Tech Industry Takes It One Further With New Ladder Desks

TEXT:

Standing desks are old news, that’s according to a prominent tech start-up based out of a hot desking share space in Betoota’s Old City District.

Deliveridoo, as it is currently known, is purported to be Australia’s number 1 ice cream toppings delivery service. And on top of allowing their casually-employed staff to bring their small-sized dogs to work, they are now also ahead of the curb with several other workplace perks.

One, a free subscription to Slack, Dropbox and any other software programs required for work.

Two, ladder desks.

A natural evolution of the standing desk, The Ladder DeskTM has gained popularity recently due to purported health benefits, though there is no good medical evidence such benefits actually exist.

“It’s really good for my calves” says local apptrepreneur, Rowan Fairfax (27).

“Sure it’s cost a bit of money, but the returns are usually fucking epic – when it comes to health and wellbeing. I’ll send you some articles”

“It’s a bit like Deliveridoo. Getting this thing off the ground has been pretty costly and dad has been pretty skeptical. But like, the Ladder Desk, when people finally cotton on to what it is, and what it provides, it’s, like, basically free money”

“I’ve carved off a pretty specific part of the market and the projected outcomes have been measured up against the optimised algorithms of several channels that cater to an easily disrupt-able demographic of key audience behaviours”

“I’ve just got to find a developer”

Critics Of Gina Rinehart’s Climate Denial Eat Humble Pie After Discovering She Owns A Prius

TEXT:

Earlier this week it was revealed that billionaire mining magnate Gina Rinehart is a key donor to Australian climate science denial promoter, the Institute of Public Affairs.

The news attracted criticism from the wider public in general because as the owner of Hancock Prospecting, Ms Rinehart profits directly from the destruction of the environment on the whole.

However, all of those outspoken climate warriors have been forced to eat humble pie this morning after The Advocate revealed that Gina Rinehart is the proud owner of a 9-year-old Toyota Prius – thus hence whom proving that the swashbuckling West Australian cares about the environment.

“It’s not my daily driver, but I let my house staff use it whenever they like,” laughed Gina.

Australia’s richest person spoke candidly to The Advocate via mobile telephone this morning.

“There are a lot of people in the community who like to say I don’t give a flying fruitbat about the climate and environment. That’s categorically incorrect and hurtful,” she continued.

“Like many other people of note, celebrities if you will, the onus is on me to own a Toyota Prius because they are better for the world than say, a team of D11s working around the clock. So to those who criticise me for being a polluter, suck eggs!”

One local critic of Ms Rinehart’s climate policy spoke to our reporter a short time ago about the developments surrounding her Prius.

Lewis Greer, of the Diamantina Climate Institute, said he was gutted when he heard that Australia’s biggest climate vandal was anything but.

“It’s true,” he said.

“You can’t own a Prius if you don’t care about the environment. This is clear evidence that Gina Rinehart is concerned about the environment and climate change in general. I’ve eaten enough humble pie this morning to bust a kevlar lapband!”

“I hope Twiggy Forrest owns one. I know he’s donated almost half a billion dollars to charity but until he buys a Prius, he can burn in the fires of hell!”

Group Makes Unanimous Decision Not To Invite Mate Who Films Everything To Kick-On

TEXT:

“I just don’t need the stress of having him around, you know?”

“The last thing I need is to wake up in the morning and see what I did after I blacked out. Don’t get me wrong, he’s a good bloke, he just films everything we do on the piss and tonight, I just want to relax.”

Tyler Dollarhyde finds it funny to wait until 10 or 11 the morning after a big session before he starts posting photos and videos to the group chat of the night before.

Themes include friends with their dicks out, people doing Class-A banned substances, breaking both themselves and the property of strangers.

The list goes on.

Which is why last night, he was consciously not told that there was going to be a kick-on.

The South Betoota Polytechnic students took special care in organising the off-license grog so Tyler wouldn’t know about it.

Then, like they’d time-travelled back to 1993, the remaining boys in the group chat phoned around to make sure they all knew to head to Jonesy’s place for the kick-ons.

“And with that, we all said goodbye as they were locking up the Club and Tyler got in a cab and went home,” said one friend, who asked to remain anonymous.

“The rest of us then piled into the back of Mark’s* silver Commodore wagon and drove home slowly through the backstreets,”

“By by Joh, once we got back to Jonesy’s, all of us felt a sense of freedom that’s rarely matched by modern standards. We could do anything we wanted to do without fear of it being filmed and laughed at later on.”

This morning, each of them woke with reduced-levels of post-piss anxiety.

Some of the lowest levels each of them had felt in years.

As for what the future holds for young Tyler, his friends are still up in the air about it.

“We’ve thought about taking his phone and hiding it from him at the start of the night. Then we could watch him run around the house in a panic, ask to borrow our phone to call the cab company. That would be funny but we’ll cross that bridge when we get to it.”

Schooner Of Water Left By Drunk Self On Beside Table Fails To Shake Grog Horrors

TEXT:

In a selfless act of kindness, Peta Alice-Jones did something remarkable last night and picked a dirty schooner glass up off her living room table, filled it with water, placed it on her bedside table – then proceeded to pass out almost immediately.

It was the first school night the 24-year-old project manager had been out on in months.

“It’s not something I like to make a habit of,” she said.

Ms Alice-Jones spoke to our reporter this morning downstairs at the cafe on the ground floor of The Advocate’s Daroo Street newsrooms.

“But yeah, we just got caught in a flat spin. Pilots will know what I’m talking about. There was no escape. Next thing I know, I’m trying to unlock a flat phone at 3 am outside the Chèvre Galopante Club in the French Quarter,” she said.

“Luckily, Bridgette’s phone was still chugging along in the red zone which got us an Uber. But yeah. Home when the birds were chirping. So it’s safe to say I feel like I’m fucking dying right now. Why do I do the things I do?”

However, the now-lifeless Capricorn said he did the old ‘I’ll get myself a drink of water for the morning’ routine – only to wake up this morning, down the schooner of life-giving water then discover that it didn’t really have the curing effects she thought it would.

“I honestly thought I’d be right after the water,” she said.

“It was even nice and cold. I’ve still got the grog horrors real bad. I can’t remember huge swathes of last night,”

“I reckon this is my own personal casus belli to stay home this weekend and have a quiet one.”

Tradesman’s Opinion Of Cyclists Changes Dramatically After Blowing the Bag Last Week

TEXT:

Mercifully, his boss agreed to keep his tools in his ute for him in the interim.

Otherwise, Will Runyon’s life would be at the bottom of the bin – deeper than Oscar the Grouch’s gooch, he says.

Speaking candidly to The Advocate about his dramatic drink-driving arrest last Friday, the 26-year-old said he used to hate cyclists but now he’s charmingly impartial.

He used to dream about boinking them with the end of his bullbar into oncoming traffic.

How they ride down the middle of the road, how they think they own the road.

Fuck them, he thought.

“They don’t even pay rego. If one of them breaks the law or worse, gets away with it, there’s no way of telling who they are. Police could always chase them down or run their DNA after they drag their lifeless bone bags out from under a Pajero or something but that, to borrow a word from the left-wing media, would be quite problematic,” he said.

The Betoota Heights man conceded that there would be local cyclists who read these words – then feel compelled to email The Advocate about how insensitive they are toward cyclists.

“Mate, I’m a cyclist now and I hate other cyclists. I used to be a motorist and I hated other motorists. Honestly, it’s very embarrassing having to ride a bike to work. The boys put shit on me at smoko and stuff,” he said.

“However, my bunji, the opinion I have of cycling, on the whole, has changed wuite dramatically.”

Pausing to compose himself, the droll Virgo said that while he used to see cycling as something that was a mere nuisance to motorists – and a great benefit to organ banks around the nation – but he now sees it as a tangible alternative to driving.

“If I had a job in town where I didn’t throw shit in skips all day, I might actually do it. But I’ve got tools and whatnot. Things to carry that you can’t on a bike. So I need my Navara.”

When asked if his change of heart had anything to do with his recent drink-driving charge, Runyon left out a soft ‘yeah’.

Group Of Mates Too Hungover To Walk Next To Each Other

TEXT:

After a big night watching Queensland save face, a local group of single 20-somethings have today made the 200m journey to a local fish and chip store, in an attempt to quell the hangovers currently pulsating through their temples and out their pores.

The group of four are experiencing a rare ‘honeymoon’ of young adulthood where none of their mates have jobs and are able to just hang at eachothers houses all day and be hungover.

The fact that all men are sweating profusely and probably not wearing enough clothing for this brisk Winter is the first sign that they might have overdone it last night.

In fact, so strong is the post-beer dysphoria, the quiet group of stocky gentlemen appear to be even too dusty to walk next to each other, let alone in sync.

With two to three feet staggered between each, the biggest grub of the group proceeds to light up a cigarette.

“How the fuck are you able to do that?” asks his disgusted mate, downwind.

“That’s the last thing I feel like. I haven’t eaten in like 24 hours”

The smoker simply shrugs and spits, before taking a drag.

It seems that he immediately regretting lighting up the cigarette, promptly throwing all $2.50 of it into the gutter.

“Yeah. You’re right” he says.

“Fuck I’m hungry”

The next 90 metres are completed in complete silence at roughly 5 kilometres an hour.

Suburban Mum In Indian Restaurant Sounds Out Her Order In Weird Broken English Accent

TEXT:

A local late 50s suburban mother of three has today debuted supreme cultural sensitivity by talking to the waitress in a way that she’ll be able to understand.

Local bank teller, Shannon Hayes understands that conversational Australia English can be confusing for migrant hospitality workers, that’s why she speaks in a weird as fuck hybrid of English and what she believes to be an Indian accent.

“Can we hava chick-un ti-ka ma-sa-la” she asks, politely.

“And-uh do-uh you-uh have some-uh naan bread”

The waitress, a 25-year-old Australian-born medical student, Aanya, says the relatively new phenomenon of Australians presuming that brown people can’t understand them is probably a generation too late.

“When my parents first opened up this place they couldn’t speak a lick of english and people used to come in and ask them to ‘whip up some curried sausages’ – as though they knew what the fuck that meant”

“A generation later, my parents are speaking fluent English and all of a sudden now the customers decide to speak slowly”

“Nowadays they come in here and order authentic cuisine in weird accents”

While Shannon tip toes around pronunciations, the waitress pretends to be just as unassimilated as Shannon thinks she is.

“She didn’t need to do the head wobble.” says Aanya.

Autumn Set To Begin 6 Weeks Early In Britain

TEXT:

The Great British Summer is over and the reason behind it has both baffled and concerned climate scientists around the globe.

In the space of just twenty-four hours, the leaves and trees in the pleasure dome that is summer in England have all turned an auburn gold – heralding the beginning of the long winter ahead.

Thousands of tourists are heading home; the Qantas check-in desks at Heathrow are all manned for the first time in months instead of just the one lonely staffer there sitting behind the big dusty desk.

As to what caused the great freeze currently sweeping the British Xanadu, nobody is quite sure according to CSIRO climatologist, Wendy Frost.

“We don’t know what’s caused England to suddenly cool and what’s brought autumn on six weeks early. Whatever did is cause for great concern,” she said, “Facetiming” The Advocate from her desk within a nondescript Canberra office block.

“It might have something to do with their soccer team getting done in extra time last night, which is very funny. Sucked in, you yellow-teethed protectionist suck-holes. And when I say ‘might’, it’s a very big might. It needs to be investigated further,”

“And we’re flat out at the moment so don’t expect anything soon. We’re worried, as climatologists, that our jobs might be next if we don’t fix the climate like the right-faction God Squad in the Coalition expects us to do.”

Frost then dropped out because she lost reception walking into the office kitchenette.

The Advocate‘s own Imran Gashkori, our sports editor, is currently in London and he explained to our reporter that the feeling on the ground there is ‘subdued’.

“I watched the game down at Clapham Common and I had a cup of somebody else’s urine thrown on me when England scored the first time,” he said.

“Fuck this place, man. But yeah, boss. They reckon autumn has begun here. The trees suddenly changed colour when the whistle blew at full time,”

“There were Australians here cheering for England over Croatia. That’s the real story here. Those loyalist losers. Imagine cheering for England in anything. Yuck! I’m coming home next week, please make sure my desk is clean when I get back.”

Husky Boyfriend Polishes Off Year’s Worth Of Salt And Sugar During Opening Credits

TEXT:

A moron boyfriend has nigh-on overdosed on salt and sugar this week, after ignoring the best advice of his girlfriend, again.

Blake Ashford (24), a young electrician from the Golf Course Estate put his lack of self-control on full display last night as he wolfed down a large bucket of popcorn before the opening credits had finished.

The well-intentioned young man admitted to our reporters today that he just can’t help himself sometimes.

“Hayley, my girlfriend warns me every single time we go to the movies, not to touch the popcorn before the movie starts, but I just don’t have the willpower.”

“It’s very very lucky that we were in a situation where you have to be quiet because if that wasn’t the case, I think she may have gone ballistic at me,” Ashford said.

“And she’s right. I’m an idiot. I know that. I just can’t help it. I’m like a dog, if you put food in front of me I go for it. It’s just animal instinct.”

We also spoke to Hayley, Blake’s girlfriend about his inability to control his impulses.

“Last night was the last time I ever “share” popcorn with him again. It doesn’t matter the size of the bucket, he polishes it off before we are long enough into it for the music at the beginning of the film to finish,” Hayley said.

“It’s not like I want heaps, I just want a decent enough amount to graze upon during the movie.”

“And that’s awfully fucking difficult when he’s face down in the bucket like a pig in a trough.”

New Older Man Friend Is Dating Coincidently Makes Bank

TEXT:

Amy Henry is looking down at her phone as she mindlessly shovels a boiled chicken into her mouth.

By the looks of things, many of her friends are overseas at the moment.

Instagram story after Instagram story; one pal galavanting around the Greek islands; another mate is on the cusp of greening out in an Amsterdam park.

But the meek 25-year-old portfolio manager has noticed that one friend in particular, is currently enjoying her second overseas holiday of the year.

“How the hell can she afford it?” she thought to herself.

She poked her head up over her cubical walls to see if one of the partners had come back from lunch yet.

Nope; she was free to continue looking like she wasn’t doing anything.

So quickly, before they came back, Henry spoke to our reporter on the telephone about what she was thinking and feeling about it all.

“I want to know how she gets the time off? It doesn’t add up. Well, to be honest, it probably does,” she said.

“Her new bloke works in a bank or something. Wait a minute, I’ve got his card in my top drawer.”

Amy put the phone down on the desk and our reporter heard draws being reefed open and shut. She swore a few times as well.

“Here it is. He works in emerging markets for Credit Suisse in the Old City District. What does that mean?”

Our reporter explained that it means he harvests human misery from the third world, takes it to Wall Street via Panama, Bermuda, Jersey and Malta and then eventually it makes it way back to Cliff Street in the town’s fabled Old City District.

“So that means he makes bank?” asked Amy.

Our reporter said it meant he probably made enough to go on two overseas holidays each year.

“Ah well, I guess that makes sense! I’m happy for her! Thanks!”

Amy hung up the phone and went back to eating her $13 boiled chicken salad.

All of a sudden, an email from a client came in declaring some sort of emergency that needs to be fixed by midnight tonight.

She cancelled dinner with her marginally employed boyfriend, Max, then got back to work.

Half-Sick Colleague Heroically Comes Into Work To Carry Out Duty To Make Everyone Else Sick

TEXT:

A mildly unpopular bag of shit moonlighting as an account coordinator at a local multinational boutique advertising firm has today gallantly pulled himself together to come into work – despite feeling quite unwell.

With a sharp bark and a runny nose to boot, Lindsay Mulliscoles slammed back two paracetamol tablets over breakfast this morning, looked himself in the mirror and boarded the D45 down the hill to the French Quarter.

“Lesser men would’ve stayed home in bed,” he said proudly to our reporter.

The 34-year-old hero spoke to The Advocate this morning via wireless telephone about his courageous mission to not let the team down at work.

“But we’ve got new clients coming in left right and centre. The new financial year is one of the busiest times for us. Taking a day off now is testament to failure. Do you think the good people at Pepsico, my favourite client, would take kindly to the fact I’m replying to their emails from bed?”

“Hot tip; they wouldn’t. So here I am, sitting at my desk, doing some admin and talking on the phone to you. Smashing it out. I’m the fire warden, too. So I’ve got a responsibility to keep my flock safe from a potential fire.”

However, our reporter couldn’t find one person at the Clemenachi PAWG South Betoota office who appreciated Mulliscoles’ selflessness this morning.

Speaking candidly to The Advocate this morning in the designated smoking area of the office block Clemenachi currently leases, account co-managing director executive Lucy Gloch said that if she wakes up sick tomorrow, she’s going to get a cab over to Lindsey’s semi-detached Betoota Heights granny flat and stab him to death with a pair of scissors.

“I’m not even kidding, I’ll do 20 years for it,” she said.

“We’ve got so much on at the moment, I can’t even begin to fathom being sick right now. If that snivelling bag of shit makes me sick, I swear to every God there is, I’ll fucking end him!”

“Now fuck off, I’ve got work to do.”

Soul Of Rapidly Gentrifying Suburb Officially Dies As ‘Dapper Gent’ Barber Shop Opens

There was a time in the not-too-distant past where a young man – or woman – could enjoy an evening in the French Quarter and still feel like they were alive.

Nights could take you anywhere.

Whether it be shovelling or sticking a Class A Banned Substance into your sickly body, unprotected sex with a prostitute, a fistfight with a stranger outside a takeaway.

Opening this morning, a new ‘dapper gent’ barber shop as scratch the hairdressing itch the town didn’t even know it needed to scratch.

Starting at $40 for a beard trim, the deluxe service comes complete with a complimentary glass of a luxurious liquor or a crispy cold beer.

The Advocate was present at the opening of Connasse et Branlette Barbers on Rue de Fils de Pute this morning and witnessed the very last part of the French Quarter evaporate.

“Then one of them got a haircut and the rest took photos of him in the chair,”

Mature-Age Student Adds Another Valuable Family-Related Anecdote To Class Discussion

TEXT:

Classes have resumed at South Betoota Polytechnic College this week and one of the only journalism students without brain matter leaking out of their ears is Graham Jenkins.

Not because he didn’t try – but because he’s 49-years-old.

In JRN302 this morning, nearly everyone in class was still barely conscious after the first Silly Sunday back at Sideways Bar – save for Graham, who’d even showered this morning.

Professor Alan Cartwright, who’s taught the print stream for nearly a decade, knew this would be the case, so he kept the contents of today’s class rather light.

As the class discussion inevitably moved to fake news, two of the studious Pisces’ less-than-enthused classmates offered their two cents but it clearly wasn’t enough.

Graham cleared his throat and began.

“It reminds me of a time when my children were toddlers,” he prefaced.

“When they became self-aware enough to learn how to lie. I’d ask them if they were telling the truth and they nodded, thinking I’d believe them,”

“I think journalism, on the whole, is going through a similar type of honesty Rennaissance.”

It was too much for one fellow student, who stood up, nodded at Professor Cartwright – who nodded back knowingly – then excused himself from the room to vomit the six smokey-barbecue-sauce-lathered hash browns he had for breakfast back up into the nearest toilet.

Graham also cottoned on to where the youngster was going.

“Yes, it’s enough to make you sick!” he zinged.

A handful laughed.

“Back to what I was saying, it’s like when my wife, God bless her, borrows my car and doesn’t fill it up when she’s finished!”

“Journalism is like your car, being driven by somebody else, then they give it back without petrol.”

Professor Cartwright smiled a little bit – then asked the most savagely hungover person in the room for her opinion.

She lifted her head off the desk and in the croakiest, most cigarette-stained voice said:

“Who gives a shit? I’ll probably end up working in PR account management or at some soulless multinational advertising agency in town?”

The professor laughed.

“Yeah, you’re probably right.”

Nurse Takes To Social Media To Remind Followers She Is, In Fact, A Nurse

TEXT:

Local nurse Zara Shipmen (35) has taken to social media as part of a bold and daring campaign to remind her friends and followers she is, in fact, a nurse.

Having worked as a nurse for ten years, Shipmen appreciates that social media is a place for her to share photos of her cat, videos about cheese restaurants and memes about nursing that remind her friends that she is a nurse and that nursing is hard and important.

“Do you know what, I’ve got a friend who’s a teacher that reckons she’s got it hard!” laughed Shipmen.

“Haha, alright love, tell me all about it during the two weeks of holiday you just started!”

After a frantic day of restraining a junkie, being yelled at by no less than 12 baby boomers and stopping a man from bleeding to death, Shipmen likes nothing more than to unwind by posting on social media about how she got paid less than a doctor to do all of that today.

“You don’t see doctors sharing memes about their job, do you? It’s because everybody already respects doctors and they’re too busy playing golf anyway!”

Shipmen plans to eventually post something on social media that is unrelated to her job but will only do so once the hospital she works at is not short staffed and the working nurses receive a fair pay increase.

“So don’t hold your breath! Otherwise, I might have to come save you! Hang on, sharing that.”

Student Disappears Into Intellectual Phase In Haze of Cafe Creme Smoke

TEXT:

After completing his first semester of university, arts student Bernard Carrol (18) has disappeared into his intellectual phase in a brooding haze of Cafe Creme smoke.

Now one-sixth of the way through a degree that will earn him the respect of his mum and $30,000 in debt, Carrol has learnt that being smart can be kind of cool and that nothing is cooler than smoking mini cigars with a slight coffee flavour.

“Where’s the fun in cigarettes after all?” mused Carrol as he read his secondhand copy of Slaughterhouse-five.

Since meeting like-minded people at university, Carrol has embraced free-thinking by joining his friends in discourse about free will, furniture design classics and novels from the ‘50s written by American male authors.

On campus, the group is sometimes referred to as the ‘Fedora Kids’ a nickname Carrol thinks is hilariously misplaced.

“What they are referring to as a fedora is actually called a trilby hat. It’s a common misconception.”

Carrol is the next to be hosting the groups’ monthly poker game and he has purchased a lovely aged whiskey that he thinks will match superbly with his Cafe Creme’s once he works up the courage to try it without Coke.

“It will be a great night! The newest New Philosopher will be out by then so there will be plenty to discuss, believe you me!”

Friends Of Bespectacled Man Try On His Glasses Then Say He’s Blind – If He Didn’t Know Already

TEXT:

City Worker Tom Hankton has worn glasses since the age of 6 has only today realised just how blind he is. 

The revelation came about over a boozy long birthday lunch, as friend after friend had a go at trying on his glasses. 

“Fuck, Tom, you are so blind!” Stated Tara, rather obviously before taking them off and passing them to the next person. 

“Omg wtf? They’re actually hurting my eyes, your eyesight must be terrible! It’s like opening my fucking eyes underwater!” Added Sophie, who continued the pass the parcel game that was now taking place with Tom’s glasses. 

The glasses continued to make the rounds along the lunch table, with a cacophony of unhelpful observations filling the air along the way. 

“I feel like they’re making me cross-eyed, like I’ve had a whole box of dry white in under an hour!” 

“Oi, blind boy! Can you see how many fingers I’m holding up?” 

The Advocate believes Tom has a condition known as Hyperopia (long sightedness), a condition of the eye where the curvature of the cornea is flat or the axial length of the eyeball is short. It’s understood that when light enters the eye, it does not focus directly on the retina, but focuses beyond the retina. This causes near sighted images to appear blurred. 

“I’m happy that I finally know how blind I am” said Tom. 

“Up until now I was just wearing them as a fashion statement, but now I know for sure that I’m blind.”

Despite there being a smorgasbord of alcoholic serving establishments with over 4.5 stars on TripAdvisor within 500m, the group are listening to one dickhead mate who suggested they travel over 3km to the casino.

“Boys, should we hit up the cas?”

“It’ll be grouse!”

“We’ll walk out of there with a gut full of piss and pockets full of chips.”

As Betoota hasn’t succumbed to the same pressures our southern cousins, lock out laws are yet to be implemented. So, while it may seem like the casino is the only option at 2:30am, there are in fact over 16 better options than the casino right now.

It’s understood that the man who suggested the casino has not been out of the house in over six months. Not in a weird anti-social way, but because he has been under the thumb of his girlfriend, who apparently develops separation anxiety if the two are apart for more than 30 minutes – Bryan explains.

“Mate. It’s the fucking worst.”

“You don’t hear from him for 6 months, then the one time he does come out he tries to make us go to the casino.”

“I mean, look, I’m not complaining. I love the cas.”

“It just pisses me off that he’s calling the shots.”

“Anyway, I’m pissed now so have probably said too much. Do me a solid and don’t print any of this?”

Pious Colleague Crumbles At Work Drinks On The First Friday Of Dry July

TEXT:

Clerical assistant Nina Barnes (25) believed herself to have an iron will but has ultimately tripped at the first hurdle and joined in at work drinks on just day six of Dry July.

When office pisshead Alex Noble (43) dished out the afternoon drinks he mistakingly poured a dry white for Barnes, forgetting she was doing Dry July. Hesitating momentarily, Barnes discretely accepted the drink after precisely four seconds of inner-turmoil.

“No I can’t, I…ah, just give it here. Thanks,” said the disgraced former humanitarian.

Witnesses state Barnes initially tried to hold her wine covertly under her desk but was eventually caught out by sales leader Karen Clarke, who was dirty about it considering she had supported Barnes by donating a fiver.

“I’m asking for it back! I don’t donate to quitters!” she slurred from the bottom of her fourth merlot.

After being caught out, Barnes decided that seeing as she’d already cocked up Dry July, she might as well help herself to another couple of glasses tonight just to make sure any cravings are out of her system for the rest of the month.

“I’ll just make sure I don’t drink on August 1st so I will have still done a month sober. That’s a Wednesday so it should be easy.”

Not wanting to crumble to the social pressure of drinking and the niggling sense that everything will be ok after one sip of cool white wine, Barnes has hatched plans to make sure she does not have a drink again this July.

“From now on, on non-week nights I’m just going to just take some sleeping pills and play ASMR videos over the speakers. If I don’t do that I might actually end up drinking furniture cleaner.”

“I made a commitment and I’m going to stick to it to raise money for cancer or whatever it is.”

“A Couple Of Chips” Identified As Gateway To Half Of Boyfriend’s Meal

TEXT:

Boyfriends across the nation are on high-alert as Betoota University professors released a report confirming that ‘just a couple of chips,’ is a girlfriend’s gateway to eating half of her boyfriend’s meal.

The ‘Gateway Chip’ theory has been hypothesised as far back as the 70’s but has now been confirmed following the landmark study.

Dr Sam Anderson chose Betoota’s KFC for the intensive study, as it’s the most likely place blokes would indulge in a fried chicken bonanza and be lied to by their girlfriends, who might claim that they’re ‘fine for now actually.’

“In 79% of cases where the girlfriend did not order her own food she ended up eating half her boyfriend’s meal. 99% of the time, the first thing she went for was a couple of chips,” states Dr Anderson.

The 94 page report details that while boyfriends are usually happy to share one or two chips with their girlfriend, they become disgruntled after she asks for a sip of Pepsi, a dip of potato and gravy and eventually a bite of chicken.

“Looking at these figures we have a strong reason to believe that up to 62% of the subjects studied didn’t even want a chip in the first place but were just using it as a way to get their fix of some hot, fresh chook.”

“This is a smart strategy as 88% of times the girlfriend asked for a bite of chicken right away, she was rejected with statements like, ‘I thought you said you didn’t want any.’”

Whilst the ‘Gateway Chip’ theory has received praise in the scientific community, girlfriends across the country are reportedly concerned about the findings.

One girlfriend who requested anonymity said; “We had a good run, I’ll just have to figure out another way to weasel my way in.”

Boyfriends are however feeling vindicated, with one young man by the name of Ed Kennedy saying; “Mate, the amount of times I watched my meal being lovingly prepped by hand with the Colonel’s secret herbs and spices, only for her (his girlfriend) to put away half the wings in front of me”.

“But now, I have proof that what she does is deliberate and I can counteract it. I’m just feeling relieved really.”

For now, Dr Anderson is encouraging anyone who finds themselves in this situation to order extra chips for their partner, up-size their meal or failing that seek relationship guidance and counselling.

Residents Of A Quiet Suburban Cul-De-Sac Lick Their Lips As Skip Bin Appears

TEXT:

The inhabitants of Spoon Street in the leafy northern suburb of Betoota Grove are salivating this morning, after spotting a newly delivered skip bin sitting on the curb.

The skip bin was dropped off by the Farrugia Brothers, the Maltese family who rule the demolition and waste industry roost in the Diamantina Shire (by questionable means at times) early this morning, much to the relief of local builder Andrew Wilson.

Wilson, whose got mounds of rubble piling up on his reno job in the Grove was pleased to see Jeff Farrugia dropping the skip off as he said he needed to get moving cleaning the site up.

Wilson said he immediately ordered his apprentice and the two other blokes on his payroll to start filling the skip up because in his own words, he ‘didn’t come down in the last shower.’  

“I’ve done enough jobs in my time to know that all of the vultures are circling,” he said.

“See, look over there at 10 o’clock, to my left. See there, the middle-aged woman peering through her curtains at the skip,” Wilson said to our reporter as the curtains on a nearby window quickly swung back closed.

“They’ve all got their eyes on the prize. And that prize is filling up the skip with all of the shit they’ve accumulated in their homes.”

Wilson explained that he would sort of be able to understand why people chucked out things like furniture and building waste, but couldn’t for the life of him fathom why people were chucking household garbage into his skip.

“Cardboard? The last skip I had, there were about 5 garbage bags chucked in there. It was on a residential fucking street. They’ve literally got bins for that shit. It’s more work to put them in my skip than their own bins.”

We knocked on a few doors on the street and only got one individual to speak to us, under the proviso that he remained anonymous.

The individual explained that he has a deep-seated desire to throw things into skip bins under the cover of darkness.

“It makes me feel a bit dangerous you know. Like I’m breaking the law, but without any repercussions.”

Local Dad Suns Self On The Back Deck Like The Majestic Silverback He Is

TEXT:

Before heading into battle today, an ageing Betoota Heights father stole a minute to sun himself on his back deck while he enjoyed a warming cup of tea and a Rothman Red.

In that moment, he says, he feels completely free.

Nothing can bring him down.

Looking on from the relative safety of inside, Allan Stevenson’s wife Wanda said that he often does this type of ritual of a morning time.

“He just stands there in the sun,” he said.

“Sunning himself. He doesn’t look at anything in particular, he doesn’t even do anything. He just stares off into the distance, sips his tea, draws on his durrie,”

“Completely at peace. It’s something I’ll never understand.”

And with that, Allan whip the cold tea out of his mug and off the deck. He took one last suck on the Rothman and stubbed it out on the bottom of his shoe and put it in his hand.

He let out an earth-shattering cough and spat the by-product off the deck before sliding through the screen door and into the kitchen.

“You’re like a big gorilla out there in the sun,” said Wanda.

“Sunning yourself. You could be in a zoo!”

Allan let out a type of force- smile only someone who’s been married for 40 years can.

“I like being out in the sun, it’s good for you,” he said in a low voice.

“You know, those silverbacks don’t get where they are for being dumb. They know what’s good and what’s bad,”

“And sunning yourself on a clear morning in July is unbeatable.”

They smiled at each other and Allan picked his keys up off the kitchen island.

“See ya later.”

Bill Thinks Up A Few Good Comebacks Just In Case Leyonhjelm Calls Him Names Today

TEXT:

Out on his usual Wednesday morning run in Canberra, Opposition leader Bill Shorten took the time to come up with a few good barbs to throw back at David Leyonhjelm – just in case the unpopular misogynist comes after him at work today.

Flanked by his ex-SAS bodyguards as they jogged around Lake Burley-Griffin, the Victorian bounced a few ideas off them to varying amounts of positive feedback.

“What if I call him a fuckwit? Like if I was talking to a property developer hell-bent on making workers work in the rain?” puffed Bill to his close protection leader, John.

John Citizen, who makes running with a Glock 19 down the back of a pair of gym pants look easy, said he should try being a bit wittier.

“I dunno, Bill. That’s a bit blunt,” said John like he wasn’t even running.

“Maybe you should say something like he’s only doing this to get his name out there before the election – and that it’s kind of fucked up that he’s chosen to go after a divorced mother to do it.”

Bill agreed but said he needed to be on the front foot and pull him to the rope like Ricky Ponting would – rather than flick the insults off his pads ala Mark Waugh.

“That’s a valid point, John,” coughed Bill.

“But if he calls me a soft cock like he did to Malcolm, I reckon I’ll just have to flat drop a c-bomb on him. The voters will like that. People reacted well when that robot Chris Pyne dropped one in the House.”

John laughed.

“Yeah, but you can’t say that word in that place. You’ll be no better than he is then. I reckon you should just say ‘it takes one to know one’ or something to that effect,”

Just as they started back up Parliament Hill, the Prime Minister’s BMW slowed alongside them and slowed to a light jogging pace.

The rear window slid down and Malcolm popped his head out.

“Good morning, Bill!” said the PM.

“Do you want a lift?”

Bill said he was OK.

“What do you think I should say back to Leyonhjelm today? Should I even respond?”

Shrugging, Bill said it was up to him.

“I think I’m going to double down as well and call him a ‘redundant fence-sitting cunt’ and be done with it.”

He got the double thumbs up from John, Bill and the rest of the sputtering trade union’s close protection detail.

Bill coughed again.

“Fuck John, that’s a pretty good comeback. I might get in and call him that before he does.”

Andrew Bolt Wakes Up In Hell After Passing Out On The 86 To Northcote

TEXT:

Southside columnist and Sky News television presenter Andrew Bolt, woke up in the early hours of this morning inside the bowels of his own personal hell after getting on the 86 outside his Docklands office – where he quickly passed out.

Initial reports suggest the conservative commentator was only planning to get the tram across the river to meet friends for dinner at Melbourne’s fabled Bourke Street Mall.

However, it wasn’t meant to be.

As the 86 slithered its way past the relative safety of Parliament Station and into the city’s wild north, the tram rocked the 58-year-old deeper and deeper to sleep.

Speaking to the non-taxpayer-funded media this afternoon, Bolt conceded that it was a ‘miracle’ that he made it through Fitzroy’s morally bankrupt Gertrude/Brunswick/Smith Street district at such a late hour unscathed.

“It’s almost a year to the day since I was attacked by masked cowards in Carlton North,” said Bolt, outside the Sky News Building in Melbourne’s conservative ‘green zone’ in Docklands.

“I’m not a fool, I know that it’s just a matter of time until somebody else tries to have a go at me. I try to mitigate these risks, somewhat. I don’t live in fear but I’m not about to paint a target on my back by having dinner with Rowan Dean at Naked For Satan of an evening’s time,”

“But last night, I made an error that could’ve ended poorly for me. Old Boltaroony could’ve been a goner.”

In a segment of his show tonight that’s since been cut by a Sky News executive producer left skittish by the recent controversy storm smothering the news media organisation, Bolt described what happened when he finally came to.

He said a mild panic swept over him like waves over drunk wallowing in the shallows of a Portsea beach.

“I thought to myself, ‘Jesus wept. I might have to fight my way out of here,’ but then I suddenly realised just how deep I was north,” he delivered deadpan to the camera.

“As I alighted from the tram, I looked up to Northcote Social Club. A place I’d only read about. A place where young men and women go to ‘hook up’ and listen to music. It was like I was looking into the eyes of Colonel Walter E. Kurtz himself. Deeper and deeper into the heart of darkness the 86 doth taketh!”

“The denizens of that suburb that good taste and Jesus forgot, began to cotton on to who I was. A crowd began to form and the hairs on the back of my neck stood like cactus spikes! My fists clenched. I beckoned the first to have a go, I was ready!”

“But then one collarless young man told me to fuck off back to Prahran before walking away. I seized my chance and hailed a taxi. There, once back inside the safe warm bosom of that Ford Falcon, I felt safe. The nostalgic whirl of the Falcon transmission was a comfort. Told the cab driver that I was concerned about my safety up here, to not stop at traffic lights in case the unthinkable happened. In case I got Tupac’d.”

Bolt then said the taxi driver told him to take the serial-number-less Smith & Wesson .38 Detective Special from the centre console and start loading it.

Unfortunately, the Sky News board decided to stop him there.

Both Bolt and Sky News refused to comment on the matter further.

Embarrassed Professional Needlessly Defends Personal Wealth Moments After Card Declined

TEXT:

“That’s funny, I should have almost $3000 on that card,” he said loud and bright like a flashbang.

“Here, try my American Express.”

The card linked to Samuel Davis’ everyday transaction account had just been declined.

As part of his morning ritual, the 27-year-old city worker stopped off at his favourite hole-in-the-wall cafe in the French Quarter before he made his way up the hill to his boutique – yet charmingly bespoke advertising agency that pays him to coordinate accounts.

However, his handsome pay packet didn’t save him from a violent embarrassment this morning.

Seconds after his American Express footed the bill for his $5 large-almond-milk-flat-white-with-five, he had his banking app open to check what had gone wrong.

On the other side of the cafe countertop paved with banana bread and muffins stood the barista trying his best to mentally escape from his harsh reality of wage theft and job insecurity.

Cassie Willis makes a pretty average coffee but her blasé attitude towards the perils of life and her job has garnered her a dedicated, cult-like following among the faceless office clones that do things with computers in agencies around town.

“Ah ha,” said Samuel.

“Looks like the error was you. There’s like $3500 in that account. See.”

He held his phone out so Cassie could see how much money he had.

She smiled and raised her eyebrows before placing his coffee on the counter for him to pick up.

Young Sam smiled back at Cassie, who he thought could only dream of amassing such wealth as an economic remora-fish cafe serf, and took off down Rue de Putain Chateau with a very broad smile on his dial.

His ego, safe.

Perennially Broken ‘Return & Earn’ Recycling Depot Dominates Discussion In Small Town Facebook Group

TEXT:

Diane Palmer has a half a carport full of aluminium drinking cans and nowhere to put them.

Close to ten thousand empty Betoota Bitter cans have been painstakingly packed into empty superphosphate bags – then packed once again by the dozen into wool bales.

The 47-year-old and her husband Greg started saving their empties after the New South Wales Government put the “Return & Earn Scheme” into practice last year.

Queensland is set to follow in December.

However, until then, Diane and many other entrepreneurial townsfolk from our great south-west have been taking their cans across the border to Tibooburra or Innaminka – with varying degrees of success.

The practice is very illegal and the trade of illicit drinking containers has already claimed a number of lives on the disputed border with South Australia near Birdsville.

But that hasn’t shaken Mrs Palmer’s resolved to provide her family with some extra money.

One small problem does exist, however.

Most Betootanese people are members of the Tibooburra Discussion Facebook Group, where more recently, nearly all of the discussion going on inside the virtual walls of the group relates to the current operational status of the local ‘Return & Earn’ recycling depot.

And it’s nearly always broken.

Denise took time out of her busy Saturday morning of watching her 10-year-old son play junior rugby league while she shouts obscenities at the 15-year-old referee, to speak to The Advocate about the Tibooburra recycling depot.

“It’s almost always fucked,” she said.

“Tell you something for free, newsboy. December can’t come quit enough. There needs to be a depot in Betoota. I’m sick of running the gauntlet to Innaminka and the Tib. I’m fucking sick of it!”

“The NSW government needs to pull their finger out. I shouldn’t have to check the Facebook group every day to see if it’s working or not. Sort it out!”

Mrs Palmer then slammed the phone down.

Man Furniture Shopping With Partner This Morning Lowkey Not Ready For This Life

TEXT:

There was a special time in Daniel Frost’s life where a thousand dollars would’ve been life changing – today it’s the difference between fabric or leather.

“I think we should get leather, it will go with the rug better,” she said.

“Actually, look at the floral print. We could just get a new rug, what do you think?”

The over-employed 28-year-old said he liked how comfortable it was and he didn’t mind what it looked like, he just imagined that he – or a friend of his could easily spend a night on it without the aid of cheap alcohol.

There was a pause.

Sally Gilbert didn’t ask him if he thought it was comfortable, she wanted to know his opinion on how he thought it’d look in the already cramped living room of their French Quarter one-bedroom semi-detached fourth-floor apartment.

“Look at the samples,” she said.

Daniel took his eyes off the hanging ceiling above him and looked down at the heavyish book of pastel coloured fabric options.

He picked out the floral pattern.

Not because he liked it, not because he thought it’d tie the room together but because it was eleven hundred dollars cheaper.

“Me too,” said Sally.

“I’ll go and find a person.”

With that, she got up off the sample sofa and went to find a salesman to take their harmless Saturday morning window shop to the next level.

Daniel wanted to say something but kept his mouth shut.

Earlier this year, the surprisingly well-built left-arm quick dropped close to a thousand dollars on a new MRF Genius Elite AB Devilliers Edition despite averaging 7.

Its price and presence in the apartment weren’t appreciated – especially after Daniel said he couldn’t afford to go to Lord Howe for a week’s break a few days before he made the purchase.

Bill Shorten Gets His Mojo Back By Growing Out A Soul Patch

TEXT:

As the path to the 2019 election hots up, Labor leader Bill Shorten has put his best foot forward and held a press conference to debut his cool new soul patch.

Shorten began the press conference by asking for a moment of silence for rapper XXXTentacion before taking questions but asking the press to do so quietly as he reportedly ‘had a wild one last night.’

According to the member for Maribyrnong, his soul patch is just one of a few ‘clutch policies’ that the Labor party are enacting ensure they are the party of the future and ‘not like those liberal old heads.’

“Young people feel let down by the government and need a representative who understands their needs and understands their memes,” said the opposition leader as he ran a union of fingers over his soul patch.

“A bit like that Nollsy bloke don’t you reckon? I’ll be making fish tacos in no time! You get it?”

Sitting backwards in his chair Shorten deflected questions about the Adani coalmine and instead promised to get the Fab Five from Queer Eye back in Australia because he didn’t get to meet them when they were here a couple of weeks ago.

“Jonathan and I would be good mates but hey?”

The press conference ended when Shorten grabbed a bottle of water from a Newscorp journalist before attempting to land a perfect bottle-flip for the remaining 15 minutes of the press conference. Eventually, deputy party leader Tanya Plibersek was called in to help Shorten with the flip and managed to do so on the second try prompting Shorten to yell “Always give Labor a second chance!”

Emerging Boy Band Showcases Musical Range With OutKast Cover

The latest contestants to be spat out of The Royal Hotel’s annual Local Voice competition have today announced that they’re starting a band. 

The newly formed four-member band thought it best to showcase their talents with 3 very different renditions of Outkast’s Hey Ya. 

Not wanting to pigeon-hole themselves into a particular genre yet, the lads released an acoustic, heavy metal and trap version of the song. As of the time of print, none of the tracks were received particularly well, with some industry bigwigs going as far as calling it “horrendous” and something they “wouldn’t even play in a car they’re about to set on fire.” 

However, these negative reviews haven’t damped the young boys’ spirit, with lead singer, Alixander [sic], saying he was very much looking forward to their first gig at the Dolphins Leagues Club. 

The boy band are yet to settle on a name, however, Alixander informed The Advocate that there were a few ideas on the table. 

“Vibe Merchants is one, then our drummer likes The Kek Patrol. My favourite is probs The Pat Cash Pash Rash Experience – get it?” 

The Advocate understands that the band has already added their 3 tracks to Spotify and YouTube, none of the tracks have got a full play yet.

Dedicated City Worker Alone In Office At 10PM Hopes Giant Multinational Employer Appreciates Her Sacrifice

He waved goodbye from the kitchenette door as he wrapped a scarf around his thin neck, meaning that Amy Wainwright was now alone.

“I hope they appreciate the sacrifices I’m making for them. But I’ll tell you something for free, they’ll know if I expense dinner. That’s for sure. They’d sooner reprimand me for shouting myself a $13 Pad Thai than slap me on the back for crushing the Woolworths BP merger in under three weeks,”

“I Grew Up Pretty Rough” Says Man With Suspiciously Straight Teeth

TEXT:

A city worker who says he was blessed genetically with a Colgate smile has spoken exclusively to our reporters about his rough working-class upbringing on our town’s city limits – and all the things that go with it.

Alastair Ross-Williams recalled an afternoon in 2001 where the police brought him home to his parents Betoota Downs Queenslander in a pair of handcuffs.

The then 11-year-old troublemaker was apprehended a short distance from the Mulholland Road overpass where he and some close friends enjoyed a fine afternoon of throwing rocks at cars.

Another lazy Sunday afternoon that year, he was again returned to his parents by members of the constabulary for wrapping a razor scooter around the head of a Birdsville teen.

“That’s the type of shit we used to get up to as a kid,” he laughed.

“I’ve since learned to be better behaved. But yeah. Mate, I grew up out at the Downs. It was pretty rough. We didn’t really have a lot. Like we didn’t have a beach house at Noosa or anything. We had a beach unit at Mooloolaba we were that poor. Fucking Longreach by the beach they used to call it,”

“Speaking of Longreach. A moment of silence for the Lyceum. The cess pit. Hope Lethal was insured. If you’re reading this, thinking of you mate. Anyway, yeah. Oh yeah, my teeth. Yeah, oi but nah. I guess I’m just lucky, hey? Fucking genetic lottery or something.”

But one coworker at the boutique and yet bespoke legal practice he and Ross-Williams work at isn’t convinced.

Speaking anonymously to The Advocate because he doesn’t want to be punched in the back of the brain when Alistair inevitably reads this inside-out colostomy bag of an article, the coworker said there’s more than what meets the eye in regards to young Ali.

“He pronounces his G’s at the end of words,” he said.

“And he knows how to sail. He’s a part of the sailing club. If you know how to sail, you can’t be working class. If your opinion is different, come down here to Finigan & Jones Legal in the French Quarter and fight me in the street,”

“Alistair’s old man is a vet. No, not that type of vet. I mean like an animal doctor. Those blokes make millions. Plus his old girl doesn’t even work. Alistair stole a bunch of animal-grade ketamine from his old man for the Christmas Party last year. I swear to God, that shit really brough the whole night undone for a lot of people. I couldn’t even unlock my phone I was that cooked. People were full on shitting their pants and shit. It was fucking wild, man,”

“Oi but yeah. Alistair 100% had braces. The spoon is lying. His teeth are good enough to be in the mouth of a news reader. Cheers.”

Country Dad Looks On Proudly As 8-Year-Old Son Skilfully Fills Cruiser Up Using The High-Flow Bowser

TEXT:

In a touching coming-of-age story, a local father has bared witness to his primary-school-aged son fill up the wagon using the high-flow bowser for the first time this morning.

Just prior to dropping his boy off a St Fanning’s Primary in Betoota Heights, grazier Darcy Fogle flicked on the blinker and pulled into the Castlereagh Road  Service Station to fill up.

But there was a grey fucking nomad at the only regular diesel pump and Christ knows those gibbering old economic handbrakes take their sweet time at service stations – so Darcy decided to use the truck-only high-flow – something that only the most experience diesel cowboys should attempt.

Just as he rounded back around up to the pump, a quiet voice whispered from the back seat as he turned off the engine.

“Can I fill up the car, Dad?” said his 8-year-old son, George.

Darcy paused and pursed his lips. If his wife ever found out, he’d have the Jamie Oliver Teflon boinged up the backside of his head.

Was he old enough, he thought to himself.

He thought back to when he was a boy. When his old man first gave him the responsibility of filling up the two-tone wood-panelled Zephyr with that sweet-smelling super.

He was only 7.

“Yeah, mate. You can,” he said.

“But let me help you. This is the high-flow pump and if you mess this up, I’ll most likely end up in prison. Don’t ever tell your mother I let you do this.”

Young George smiled and jumped out of the late model Sahara and ran quickly around to the pump.

Two hands and twenty seconds of grunting later and he had the fuel cap off.

“Put it in the holder, mate. That way you won’t forget to screw it back up when you’re done.

George nodded.

The pump handle was heavy but not too heavy for the growing lad.

Again, with a great amount of effort, he got the nozzle into the fuel tank and look up at Dad for the next green light to proceed.

“Now squeeze her gently. No, wooooo! You have to hold the bastard in there. Squeeze gently and push firmly at the same time. That’s it, mate. Keep her steady.”

Now Darcy knew the main tank was pretty much empty. She’d be taking close to 90 odd litres here.

It was going to be a long haul for his son’s little hands.

But he got there in the end – after ten minutes of gentle encouragement.

He told Geroge to get back in the wagon while he went into to pay the man, who gave Darcy a filthy look up and down after watching what’d just happened on the CCTV.

Just and the father-son duo peeled out of the service station, the fucking aforementioned grey nomads pulled out in front of them without first checking their mirrors with their half-fucked cloudy retired city folk eyes.

“Fucks sake,” said Darcy.

“What Dad?” said George.

“Looks like we’re going to be late.”

Woman’s Lifestyle Not Half As Active Or Giggly As Tampon Commercial Would Have You Believe

TEXT:

Though she’s been on many a jog this year, Marcey D’Amato has never smiled or laughed while she’s on one.

Neither has she playfully giggled after being caught in a sudden downpour.

Save for the few times she and her pals have sheepishly laughed their way and stopped four busy lanes of traffic to get to their Uber, running and being outwardly happy is not something the 28-year-old does.

She said the last time she rode a bike was on a European holiday two years ago.

Being confident and carefree in public, she says, is something that seldom happens to her.

An odd list of things but to her, she sees other women on television take all these things in their stride.

Taking them in their stride while they’re doing something that makes most lawmakers wince with discomfort – menstruating.

“I don’t get these ads,” she told The Advocate this afternoon via wireless telephone.

“My life isn’t anything like those ads would suggest. A more accurate depiction would be me scrunching my face and swearing when if got caught in the rain because I’d just spent half a week’s pay on my fucking hair,”

“And the whole riding around on a bike in shorts pipe dream. It’d be more real if they showed me buying a premade lasagne at Coles and demoslishing it all in one sitting while I think about why the last guy I hooked up with never texted me back,”

“But I guess all that wouldn’t sell anything, would it?”

The Advocate reached out to a number of faceless, soulless and downright unoriginal local advertising companies for comment on the terrible, unrealistic ads they make for tampon companies – but have yet to receive a response.

Locals Sports Club Announce Steven Bradbury As Guest Speaker For The Third Year In A Row

TEXT:

If it’s not broke, don’t fix it.

That’s the message that the community is getting from the Betoota Heights Ultimate Frisbee Association (BHUFA) today after breaking the news that champion speed skater Steven Bradbury is returning to their annual luncheon as guest speaker.

For the third year in a row.

Speaking exclusively to The Advocate this morning ahead of the July 13 event, BHUFA president Doug Greenfern, said that young Steven had been such a hit in previous years that it was a ‘no-brainer’ to get him back again.

“He just has such an inspirational story,” said Greenfern.

“A real come from behind victory, we never get tired of hearing it. How it happened two times! Can you believe the odds? I don’t want to give away too much but I really think listening to how Steven won that gold medal and his story, in general, is worth the ticket price alone,”

“Plus, we have a recap of the season. A raffle and then a charity auction. It’s a real fun night. Your press passes are in the mail!”

Tickets to the event can be purchased via the Betoota Heights Ultimate Frisbee Association Facebook page or at the French Quarter Odeon box office before July 11.

A limited number will be made available at the door but Greenfern suggests the event will ‘probably sell out ‘before then.

Pub Advertising $20 Jugs Like It’s Some Sweet Deal

TEXT:

A local pub has faced criticism this week after advertising a reasonably standard priced jug as a ‘Special.’

The Dog Whistle and Fiddle, a recently renovated and rebranded version of The Clock Hotel in Betoota’s French Quarter, has been blasted for asking patrons to come into their venue on the back of a promotion offering 20 dollar jugs of some random craft beer on Wednesday’s.

“We are doing $20 Jugs of our beer of the week, The Thrifty Pensioner,” said another one of the pub’s posts on social media.

Betoota local and regular pub-goer Eli Kruger told The Advocate today that he is considering taking the pub to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) for misleading and deceptive conduct.

“20 bones for a jug of craft piss? How dare they advertise that as special,” he said.

“I can’t believe they’ve got the nerve to pretend like they are doing the punters a real solid by offering that this evening.”

Kruger said he will just be sharing a couple of jug’s of Betoota Bitter with some friends this evening as he always does, and maybe a jug of New if his ex-pat mate joins him.

We contacted the establishment about the offer, and they explained that they think it’s actually a pretty sweet deal.

“Um, the Thrifty Pensioner is actually a really interesting grapefruit infused IPA, so I think for anyone with a palate it’s actually a steal.

“We aren’t targeting the ‘punters’ anyway. We are trying to pull in the trust fund baby uni students from up the road and all of the creative cucks from the agencies and firms in the French Quarter.”

Hobby-Farming Merchant Banker Understands El Nino Is Pretty Much A Bear Market But Like For Rain

TEXT:

A French Quarter merchant banker visited his Betoota Downs farm over the weekend and frowned.

For some reason, it hadn’t rain on his rolling two-hundred-acre lifestyle block for close to a year.

If it weren’t for the bales of Mitchell grass he bought at the start of the year, Miles John-Whitford would’ve had to pith the dozen alpacas who call his front paddock home.

“Times are tough on the land,” he admitted.

“I’d always heard the term ‘El Nino’ thrown around loosely over the years – I didn’t realise it had something to do with rain. I’ve done a bit of research on it now as it’s really turning my place to shit. From what I’ve been able to ascertain is that its kind of like a bear market but for the weather,”

“Doesn’t mean you can’t make any coin out of it but you’d be fucked if I can turn a dime out of the farm at the moment. The arse has fallen out of the alpaca market. The two cashmere goats I had went mad and the cops shoot them. Anyway, now that I understand what El Nino is, a climate event, I guess I can start planning how I’ll outsmart it and gain an advantage.”

Thousands Of Obnoxious Japanese Ski Bums Descend On Australian Snowfields After Jetstar Fire Sale

TEXT:

Locals from our nation’s snowfields are demanding answers from Jetstar today after yet another busload of loud, drunk and casually racist Japanese ski tourists arrived in the skiing gateway town of Jindabyne this afternoon.

Earlier this month, the Qantas’ discount airline offered bargain basement airfares to Australia from the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido where the majority of the archipelago’s ski fields are located.

The result of that fire sale has been felt all over the country’s alpine snow slopes.

One business owner from Thredbo said many of the visiting Japanese are poorly behaved and fail to adhere to many local customs which is putting them at odds with those who call the town home.

“A group of young Japanese men have taken it upon themselves to learn a few choices swear words and then scream them out at the top of their lungs after a few drinks,” said the business owner.

“It’s not what we do around here. It’s extremely disrespectful. Swearing in public is heavily frowned upon. The fact that I can hear Japanese people dropping the c-bomb all night would indicate that there’s been a breakdown in what’s acceptable behavior,”

“They also take their shoes off at every door, blocking doorways and making them unsafe. They like to sit on the ground when they eat and get on the laughing juice. I tell you what, Jetstar has a lot to answer for.”

Qantas’ bogan missile division released a statement this afternoon after news broke of the controversy in the New South Wales snowfields.

In the statement, they refused to apologise for offering great service at unbeatable prices but said they felt for the business owners of Thredbo being kept awake by packs of Sapporo jet ski owners shouting the c-word at all hours of the night.

They consider the matter closed.

Heated Bus Argument Reaches Point Where City Worker Pauses Podcast To Listen To It

TEXT:

“What’s it to you, you putrid mutt?” she yelled.

The driver was taken aback but responded firmly.

“You need to pay like everyone else!”

It was a standard Tuesday morning on the D32 bendy bus coming in from Betoota Downs to the Old City District. Office people, tradespeople and other assorted serfs just trying to escape their collective realities on the way to work.

Most had their headphones in; most stared blankly around the bus or out the window.

There was a certain atmosphere of peace and polite decorum – which was broken shortly after Kimberly Jones stormed onto the omnibus just before Redwood Avenue.

“You’re holding everyone up, you fuck head,” she yelled back at the driver.

With a deep thump that reverberated around the bus, the driver flicked on the parking brake.

A collective sigh was let out.

“You either pay your fare, or you get off the bus,” he shot back.

That was when Mildred Hall pressed paused on Richard Fidler.

A man in the back decided to take matters into his own hands.

“Get off the fucking bus, mate. You’re going to make us all late,” he shouted.

Kimberly’s attention was momentarily drawn from the driver to the whispy-bearded man in the wearing a $340 off-the-rack suit.

“Buy a fucking car, you droopy-eyed fuck!” she screeched.

The droopy-eyed fuck sat back down.

Mildred locked eyes with a few other passengers, who were also reveling in the mid-morning drama.

As the argument – and time kept rolling on, the driver eventually caved in and pulled the door shut.

Highway Town That Already Has Everything It Ever Needed Receives First Red Rooster

TEXT:

The small farming community of Betoota Downs in the Development Road to Windorah has welcomed the arrival of a Red Rooster restaurant over the weekend – a sign that the satellite town has moved up in the world.

Betoota Downs has grown rapidly over the past two decades; it’s population and size swelling to that of a medium-sized desert community.

Recent upgrades have been made to the shopping, business and culinary sections over the years – as well as a number of education and health projects being earmarked by local government.

In 2004, the area received its first McDonald’s restaurant.

Immediately, it proved to have a profound impact on the community. With the double-edged impact of being ultimately responsible for the skyrocketing local obesity rate as well as providing limited funding for children’s sport, the community would be poorer without it according to locals.

Followed closely by a Subway storefront in the Wallace Road Shopping Arcade.

Touted as the healthier, fresher option to the golden arches, the Betoota Downs Subway shot the national fame in 2013 for going through the most seafood surprise than any other store nationwide.

However, 2018 is the year of the Rooster in this small community on the edge of the Simpson Desert.

One Betoota Downs farm worker spoke to The Advocate this afternoon about the fanfare that followed the opening on Saturday as well as the new smorgasbord of chicken-based fast food now available.

“I would’ve rathered a KFC but I’ll give Red Rooster a shot,” said Kurt Chin.

“It’s where the Video-Ezy used to be so I guess it’s got some big boots to fill. I say good luck to them.”

Chin was able to confirm to our reporter that nobody in the community really asked for a Red Rooster but they’ll take it.

“I guess this means we have everything a country town could ever want. But a KFC would be great if anybody reading this is looking for a business opportunity.”

England Whitewash Australia In Thrilling Series Nobody Knew Was Happening

TEXT:

In a survey conducted by The Advocate this morning, all nineteen of our respondents didn’t know that England has been thrashing Australia in the cricket – and neither of them particularly cared.

While some expressed shock that the national sport was now at rock bottom, all of them conceded that is wasn’t particularly surprising given the recent events that rocked cricket in this country to its absolute core.

Speaking exclusively to The Advocate, a local city worker explained that he didn’t know the ODI international series was on and that even if he knew it was on, he wouldn’t have tuned in.

Darcy Pearson, who hasn’t played a game of organised sports since it was compulsory back in high school, said the current state of cricket in Australia is a source of sadness for him.

“Yeah, look,” he prefaced as he breathed out heavily.

“It is what it is. The ball-tampering business has exposed a lot more than meets the eye. The blokes playing now have inherited a bed covered in shit. The bed-shitting that’s happened in cricket has been biblical. Honestly. Fucking sandpaper. What were they thinking?”

“There’s literally a million better things you could use to rough up a ball. Anyway. There was always going to be a period of rebuilding but it can’t get much worse. From my understanding, this is only the second time England has whitewashed Australia. The first being the arrival of the First Fleet in the summer series of 1787-88.”

None of the other respondents said anything worth reporting.

Bunnings Finally Concedes To Local Teenagers And Begins Selling Hose Pipe By The Centimetre

TEXT:

In a bold move to make sure independent hardware stores are gone forever, Bunnings Warehouse have opened a concept Betoota Ponds store where they will be debuting a new system of selling hose pipe by the centimetre.

Bunnings CEO Michael Schneider claims this is an exciting time in the companies history and he cannot wait to start giving back to the free-spirited community.

“After conducting an in-depth analysis about the local area we know that this will suit the demands of local teenagers and their mothers who are tired of having their hose pipe decimated every Friday and Saturday night,” stated the CEO.

Branch manager Darren Sidoti (44) is very excited for the community to start shopping at their customised Bunnings Warehouse, which will also be stocking Bic lighters, straightened paperclips and empty Gatorade bottles.

“On our opening day alone we sold 14 kilometres worth of hose pipe and 3,506 snags,” stated the manager as he twirled a dreadlock round his white fingers.

Amidst claims the hosepipe strategy could lead to higher levels of marijuana use, Sidoti claimed it wouldn’t be an issue, citing his own experience as an example.

“I’m an old-school boy and I used to be cutting up my mum’s hose in order to enjoy a cheeky billy but look at me know; I am the branch manager at a hardware store in the town I grew up in.”

Unconfirmed rumours state shift manager Jack Sharman (34) also deals a bit of ‘clover’ on the side and if you find a cheaper dealer, he’ll beat them by 10%.

CSIRO Declares 808s & Heartbreaks Is – And Always Will Be The Superior Kanye West Album

TEXT:

Australia’s peak scientific body has released their findings into the ongoing debate about what is Kanye West’s best album – and not everybody is happy.

Released just three weeks after Barack Obama’s historic election win in 2008, Kanye’s fourth album, 808s & Heartbreak, has been scientifically proven to be the best Kanye album to date and ‘any other opinion is inferior and wrong’.

Lead Researcher Calvin Clarke noted in the report that West’s first three albums are for children and focus too heavily on positive aspects of life – whereas 808s delves deeper into Kanye’s enigmatic and manic creative process.

“It was certainly a departure from his sound,” wrote Clarke.

“Which polarised listeners and fans all those years ago. However, it is the opinion of the CSIRO that the album has aged brilliantly and is more than a single bookend to his ‘educational-themed’ albums that came before it,”

“Our team hypothesised that prior to conducting a number of experiments on the album. We took into account the tone, lyrics and musical aspects of each song and from the data we received – it was quite easy to conclude that 808s is Kanye West’s greatest work. The Life of Pablo is a close second,”

“If any of you disagree, please get on a plane to Canberra and come fight me in the street like a Russian.”

The Advocate reached out to a number of local Kanye West fans for comment but as the CSIRO has declared that anybody who has a different opinion to them on this issue is wrong and incorrect, our editorial dictates that we cannot publish it.

“I Don’t Get Cold” Says Lying Coat-Less Hero

TEXT:

As snow falls across Betoota this week, one brave man has told friends and perfect strangers that he doesn’t get cold – something he likes to punctuate by heading out without a coat to keep him warm.

Stellan Sorensen told reporters this morning that it’s a combination of his personal gumption and Noric blood coursing through his veins that makes it very difficult for him to feel cold.

“It’s not that cold,” he said confidently.

Morning temperatures across the Simpson Desert fringe were a chilly -2 degrees and four inches of snow was recorded at Mount Remienko Observatory in Betoota Heights.

“I love it how Australians like can’t handle the cold at all. I’ve seen so many people cutting about town in their North Face parkas and puffer vests. Hey, fuck face! Where’s the Range Rover, you North Face fuckwit?!”

He chortled.

“Yeah, but quite possibly nah. Somehow, I never feel cold. Nuts, huh? Like last night, I was walking home from a mate’s place after we watched the girls’ State of Origin and I wasn’t cold at all. A heavy frost was coming down too. There as already snow on the ground. Not even a slight chill. Guess it’s genetics?”

But friends of Stellan’s can see right through the city’s worker’s charade of lies.

Like most people, says friend Colin, Stellan gets cold but feel obligated for some reason to tell everyone that he’s anything but.

“I know why he wasn’t cold last night walking home,” said young Colin.

“It might have something to do with that bottle of tawdry Teacher’s Scotch he practically inhaled upon arriving at my semi-detached rat nest down here in the French Quarter. Listen to me when I tell you that Stellan was hammered when he left,”

“I even told him not to walk but he wouldn’t have a bar of it. He just popped his headphones on and smiled as he pulled my front door closed around midnight last night. We got a few inches of snow last night, there’s no way he wasn’t cold.”

Colin’s suspicions and indeed our own here at The Advocate were confirmed by Stellan’s long-suffering bed and life partner, Rachael West.

Upon his arrival home last night around one, Rachael was awoken by a scratching at the front door.

That scratching turned out to be Stellan trying – and failing to get the key in the lock.

Taking time out of her busy morning of making just enough noise to prevent the sack-of-human misery that is Stellan himself awake, Rachael told our reporter that he was practically blue when he got home.

“There he was, standing in the doorway in his stupid fucking canary yellow t-shirt. Teeth-chattering behind blue, sickly lips,” she said.

“To answer your question, yeah. Stellan was chilled to the bone. Whether or not he was feeling, that’s a whole other can of worms that I neither want to open or waste time discussing. I’ll get him to ring you when he wakes up.”

Newly Employed Uni Grad Terrified She Might Have Slut-Dropped At First Ever Staff Drinks

Ava-Rose Sprawley worked damn hard at constructing a professional persona at her first real job.

However, on Friday night the young grad may have ruined whatever facade she’d managed to build up.

Not one to shy away from a drink in her social circle, Ava-Rose promised herself early in the night that she would try to keep a lid on her out of Work persona at her first ever staff drinks.

However, as soon as those champagne bubbles burst on her lips, that plan was out the window.

Like a duck to water, after was knocking back drinks left, right and centre.

Speaking to The Advocate, Ava-Rose confessed that the rest of the night is a bit of a blur.

“I don’t 100% remember, but I’m pretty sure I was slut dropping”

“It was so weird, everyone formed a dance circle then one by one the girls went in the middle and got a bit low”

“I distinctly remember thinking to myself, there’s no way I’m doing that, I’m too new”

“Then before I knew it, I was in there droppin’ it like it was hot”

“Whhhyyyyyy [sic]”

Church Attendance Skyrockets In Regional Centres As Drought’s Grip Tightens

TEXT:

“I’ve even been over to the mosque and prayed for rain there as well,” he said.

“I’ll do bloody anything.”

Johan Pendergast says he’s been running sheep and cattle on his 40-odd thousand hectare block an hour north of Betoota for 40-odd years – he says times are tough right now.

He’s never been a man of God.

In fact, he’s spent most of his life swimming through a polluted, filthy river of sin that he himself calls life.

Which is why many were shocked that he – and many other broken down cockys from around this district have turned to Jesus and his Dad for help.

“What else are we supposed to do? Wait for that sleeveless hay runner man to drop off a bail or two? Then what?” said the 65-year-old sunburnt Virgo.

“From where I’m standing, the only bloke who can save us now is a long-haired dribbler that lived over two-thousand years ago. What a time to be alive,”

“And as I told you earlier, I even went over to the mosque and said hello to everyone there. They made me take my shoes off and everything, which I did because I need the rain. We stood up and lay down for an hour or two and we sang some songs that I didn’t really understand the words to. But if Cat Stevens says the mosque has all the answers, then I thought I might as well go knock on the door.”

Another popular local grazier took the time to speak to our reporter today outside Betoota Heights Baptist Chruch, where he’d just finished belting out a rousing rendition of “Abide In Me” that was performed in part by the local primary school orchestra.

Darcy Montford, who had to give up growing canola here in Betoota some years ago, said that like Pendergast he’s been forced to turn to the Jesus to help him repay his debts.

“Don’t know about you mate but I’m not in the business of direct drilling canola into the side of a sand hill. There’s no money in it these days,” he said.

“That and I’ve got lambs sucking the sweat off my hands to get a bit of salt. So you can see why I’ve been going to church. Times are grim,”

“But I’ll tell you something for free. Every desperado in town is going to church these days. Everybody except the bank manager.”

BORING: Footy Fan Confused As To How A 1-All-Draw Could Ever Be Considered A Good Game

TEXT:

“There wasn’t even a result, bruz,” he said, handed extended out toward the television.

“I don’t think anybody in this house appreciates just how much I don’t like soccer. It’s the most boring thing in the world. They don’t do anything other than kick the ball around in circles and fall over when people run into them,”

“That’s not even the worst part. They’ve broadcast it at the same time as The Footy Show. And this is my television! I can’t even watch what I want in my own house on my own television.”

The case Miles Longmire is building against his housemates is a strong one but justice, especially on this godforsaken island, doesn’t always prevail.

Last night in the French Quarter sharehouse he and three other middle-class cis white males currently occupy, the 25-year-old was outvoted as to what they were going to watch that night.

Three to one.

“That would’ve been a better scoreline,” admits Longmire.

“And I don’t care who got the three goals, either. You know it’s one thing I’ve never got my head around. How a human being can sit still for two hours and watch something that doesn’t always end in a result. I tell you what, if they want more Australians to watch the game, remove the goalies. Make the scorelines like 30-37 or something.”

Our reporter spoke to one of Miles’ housemates, one who voted to watch the soccer, who said the match was great – despite Longmire’s constantly moaning.

Asking to remain anonymous, he explained to The Advocate that he watched the game because it was an idle Thursday night and Australia was playing.

“I’m not the biggest football fan in the world,” he said.

“But I enjoy sport and if a male sporting team is playing in a World Cup Final, you bet you bottom dollar that I’ll be watching it. I like cricket as much as Miles hates soccer. That doesn’t mean I won’t watch the game if Australia makes the World Cup Final next year,”

“But there’s no chance in hell that’s happening so I don’t need to worry.”

Income Tax Cuts To Somehow Benefit Battlers AND Big Business At The Same Time

Pressed on the issue, Malcolm simply chose to ignore the question and walk back into Parliament from the courtyard.

Dutton Says It’ll Take More Than Global Outrage For Him To Backflip On His Child Detention Policy

TEXT:

Former highway patrolman Peter Dutton has lashed out at US President Donald Trump this morning after the leader signed an executive order to end his policy of child separation and detention following unbridged global backlash.

Speaking to the media this morning on our state’s Sunshine Coast, Dutton said he was disappointed and angry that such a strong leader like Trump was able to be swayed so easily by public opinion.

He also confirmed that the news coming out of Washington this morning hasn’t affected his opinion on keeping children in detention and in some cases – separated from their parents or guardians.

“The US President used to be someone I admired and looked up to,” said Dutton.

“However, my opinion of him has changed overnight. To allow yourself, as a representative of the people, to be influenced and lead in policy by the public is reprehensible to me. He’s shown his true colours by doing what the majority of his country wants,”

“And no. Donald Trump’s backflip on his immigration policy hasn’t changed my mind or made me question my own. The Liberal Party policy on boat people is keeping you safe and the economy on track for surplus.”

The Advocate reached out to the Office of the Prime Minister for comment but he’s currently out kayaking around the harbour in the rain and is unavailable for comment.

Anthony Kiedis Checks Into Rehab After Shindig Addiction Relapse

Red Hot Chili Peppers frontman Anthony Kiedis has reportedly checked into a Utah rehab facility this week after his addiction to the shindig relapsed earlier this year.

Through a band spokesman, the 55-year-old said he hopes to finally kick the addiction that’s plagued him since the mid-1990s.

Hello.

Anthony Here.

I need to be honest to my friends and family; I need to be honest to the band and most of all, I need to be honest to you, the fans.

Today, I took steps to finally kick my addiction to the shindig.

I have checked myself into the same rehab facility that helped Robert Palmer kick his addiction to love back in 1985 – back when I was first experimenting with the shindig funnilly enough.

This treatment centre also helped the Puretones finally conquer their collective addiction to bass.

Safe to say, I’m in great hands.

See you all soon with love,

Anthony ‘The Michigan Magician’ Kiedis

Tributes and messages of support have flown on social media for Kiedis’ from his show business colleagues.

With the exception of Kanye West (who was under the impression Anthony had died of a tragic shindig overdose) every message was liked by Kiedis and members of Chili Peppers.

The band’s Australian-born bassist, Flea, lead tributes.

“Love you brother. Don’t let the shindig keep you down. You got this bruv [sic]”

Kiedis and the rest of the Chilis hope to resume touring later this year.

Frugal Shopper Wonders How She’ll Get Groceries Home Without Buying Reusable Bags

With half a pantry of reusable shopping bags, Stevie Milson told The Advocate she didn’t need any more – so she’d be damned if she’d buy another one as long as she lived.

However, the problem this afternoon was that all of her reusable are in the said pantry.

But that’s not going to stop the 19-year-old student.

She told reporters gathered at the French Quarter føtex self-service checkout that she’s going to attempt to carry everything home in her bare hands – or die trying.

“I’m not going to buy any more bags; they’re a rip-off, anyway,” she said.

“It’s not that far from home, I reckon I can do it. This is the new ‘taking everything inside in one trip from the car’ for this generation. Even if I drop this fucking out-of-season rockmelon, I’ll just kick it along the footpath,”

“There’s no way on God’s grim Earth that I will give this soulless multinational 20 Australian cents for a bag that’ll just end up as a surrogate garbage bag after our next kick on. Get out of my way, I’m ready.”

With the aid of our reporter balancing an avocado atop the half-carton of eggs, young Stevie was off out the sliding doors with her arms full of a week’s rations.

The sea of people of human rubble that shuffles in and out of the French District at 4pm each day failed to part.

Stevie only managed to get a hundred or so yards up the road before she dropped the avocado – worth close to 20 reusable bags.

“Fuck!” she shouted loudly enough for half the city block to hear.

“Fuck my fucking life. Fuck it right to hell.”

Local Pilot Says She Just Wants To Be Thanked Like The Glorified Bus Driver She Is

The pilot of a high-sophisticated passenger jet says she just wants to be thanked for doing her job – just like her land-dwelling cousins.

Emma Colton freely admits that she’s ‘just a glorified bus driver’ – albeit one that shoulders more responsibility and has a greater price for error – but that hasn’t stopped her desire to be patted on the back for doing the job she’s been paid for.

The rise of thanking bus drivers for simply not crashing or being late is thanks to an internet meme which has taken cultural cesspits around the western world by storm.

One question, however, still lingers in Colton’s mind.

“Why do I, a highly-trained commercial pilot, have to thank my passengers when they get off but a bus driver responsible for 20-odd-tonnes of Chinese steel gets a rousing applause and maybe even a handshake?” she said.

“I can drive a bus just as well as anybody else. I know people like to show their gratitude to pilots in their own way. Some rare species of human even enjoys clapping upon landing. Don’t do that by the way, it’s fucking weird and we pilots find it quiet embarrassing,”

“Even a polite nod. Like what men do to each other when to acknowledge each other’s presence. That’d do me.”

“Cricket Has Hit Rock Bottom” Says Millennial Who Thinks The 80s Were All Fun And Games

TEXT:

Coming of age during the nation’s sporting halcyon days at the turn of last millennium, a Betoota Grove 27-year-old is currently experiencing what many sports fans and felt before him.

The sinking feeling of crushing loss after crushing loss.

While the national women’s teams in nearly every sporting discipline continue to go from strength to strength, systematically dismantling their opponents around the world time and time again – the focus of the national interest has been on the perennially underperforming men’s teams.

Speaking exclusively to The Advocate on the D11 bendy bus from Betoota Grove into town this morning, Harry Alger said he’s sure cricket, in particular, has hit rock bottom and it’s never been in this much of a crisis.

“People will be quick to blame JL and Tim Paine for this but the problems go much deeper,” he said swinging on a hand strap.

“What the problem is, I’m not sure. But we got flogged last night. Not just a mild flogging, either. We got the worst flogging in history. The Wallabies look as happy as a polar bear at Sea World. The soccer doesn’t look much better,”

“If we get done by the Diet Coke of Scandinavia tonight, then I’d suspect Australian sport will be officially in crisis.”

However, when our reporter asked him if he was aware of what the 1980s was and what it was like to owe money and enjoy sport back then, he said no.

He said he was born shortly before the Soviet Union dissolved on Boxing Day 1992.

“I’m a Cold War baby by two weeks,” he said while another passenger in earshot rolled her 60-year-old eyes.

“But yeah, I heard we sucked at cricket back then but whatever. You had cheap houses. I could live with us being what the West Indies were in the 90s if I could afford to buy a house where I think I deserve to live,”

“Plus we were good at other sports back then. Like sailing and shit. Greg Norman and the Wallabies. Right now, all I have is a drawer full of jerseys I can’t wear, memes and enough money to get too drunk to speak once a week. This isn’t living, Josh.”

A Current Affair Reporter Apologises For Aggressive Demeanour Once Cameras Are Off

TEXT:

Earlier today, a local A Current Affair reporter was sent out to Betoota Ponds to get to the bottom of a problem that’s brought that community great pain.

A dodgy tradesman, a plumber to be exact, has had accusations of shonkiness levelled at him by scores of local residents who say they’ve paid him for a service he hasn’t delivered.

Checking his makeup in the passenger seat sun visor mirror, DTN-9 Imparja reporter Marcus Washbrook, let out a long and soft sigh and thought about the day he’d resign from A Current Affair for something better.

But that day is a long way away, so out he hopped and pumped himself up as Damien Goink, of Goink Plumbing and Taxidermy, walked out of his front door.

“Excuse me, Mr Goink. I’m Marcus Washbrook from A Current Affair,” he said in a stern voice.

Damien looked up at Marcus, frowned and told him to stay off his property.

Marcus ignored him, putting himself in a position where Damien would have to push him out of the way to get his front gate shut.

“Your silence is deafening, Mr Goink. What about the people you’ve ripped off?”

Nothing.

Using an old trick of his, Marcus turned to his cameraman and smiled.

“Mr Goink, is it true that you’re gay?”

As most of Betoota Ponds has had an inkling for years that Goink, a 51-year-old confirmed bachelor, enjoys the company of well-built men over that of a polite, homely lady, rumours have swirled for years surrounding his sexual penchants – something that Damien is well aware off.

With a sudden burst of furious anger, Damien lashed out at the television crew now trespassing on his property.

A choice few words were exchanged and Marcus’ cameraman said he had enough to put something good together.

As quickly as it started, it was over.

Now feeling guilty about the whole ordeal, Marcus quickly apologised to Damien off camera for his shocking and reprehensible behaviour.

“I’m sorry for bringing that up. I’m so sorry,” he said.

“Even if you are actually a dodgy tradie, you don’t deserve to be treated like that. No hard feelings?”

Just as Marcus put his hand out in a peace offering, Damien pulled a pair of 12-inch Crescents from the back of his belt and upside the television reporter’s head.

Now that Marcus’ brain was now rebooting slow while his lifeless corpse writhed freely on the nature strip, Damien turn his attention to the cameraman that was sprinting for the Prado parked across the cul-de-sac.

Our reporter also made a run for it.

Police and ambulance crews are currently on the scene, Marcus has been taken to Royal Betoota Base Hospital in a state of great disrepair.

This is a developing story.

Liberal Party Cafe Brawl Breaks Out After Rogue Members Criticise Ayn Rand’s Atlas Shrugged

TEXT:

In some breaking news out of Sydney, it has been confirmed that the Liberal Party Branch brawl stemmed from a disagreement over a famous book.

The brawl in South Western Sydney last night, which resulted in police attending the premises and a man being taken to hospital, reportedly kicked off after a discussion about Ayn Rand’s Atlas Shrugged.

The famous 1957 novel, although ever popular since its publication, has experienced a recent resurgence over the last few years in the large L liberal circles.

The 1100 page book depicts a dystopian United States crippled by increasingly burdensome laws and regulation upon private enterprise and businesses and has been a pseudo bible for libertarian free-market advocates for decades.

Our reporters have been told that a couple of rogue members at the Liberal Party Meeting last night spoke negatively about the book, inciting a violent altercation.

One of those rogue members has exclusively come forward to The Advocate today and explained what happened.

His name has been withheld due to concerns about reprisals.

“They always go on about the book at the meetings, and I simply said that I thought it was actually a bit of an incoherent, illogical ramble and that I wasn’t sure of its merit,” the member said.

“At that point, some of the other members began to become aggressive, and told me that the only way to live in a truly fair society is to have completely deregulated industries that can act in whatever manner they want in order to pursue ultimate profit.”

“I then raised the whole GFC thing and the fact that Alan Greenspan, one of the men culpable for the deregulating of the financial system in the US and helping to bring on the GFC was a disciple of Rand, and then bang, someone hit me in the side of the head,”

“I fell to the ground and I remember someone standing over me and saying ‘You have no idea how the world treats the prime movers. They pursue the ultimate goal for humanity, in the creation of individual wealth at all costs and go to extreme lengths in order to avoid sharing that wealth. Fool.’’

The member said that by the time he got back to his feet the whole thing had teed off.

“Yeah, basically our 2 female members had scattered and the boys were just going hell for leather.”

We contacted the Betoota Labor asking whether anything of the like has happened to their knowledge, and the told us it hasn’t.

“Yeah it can get testy at times, but basically our meetings just consist of a bunch of bland middle-class ‘progressives’ arguing about their favourite Paul Keating quote, so nah, it’s never teed off really,” they said.

Coworker Loudly Asks Dumb Question Instead Of Googling It Like A Normal Person

TEXT:

City workers at the French Quarter’s new WeWork complex were subject to a very loud man today who rather than googling the answer to his query, decided to boorishly ask the room for the answer.

Peter Moyra’s desk is on the fourth-floor beside the cool self-serve Brooklyn Lager kegerator, so he gets to hear his fair share of absolute dribble.

But that pales in comparison to the question he heard this afternoon from a fellow hotdeskperson.

“Oi,” shouted a very loud Lewis Palmer, a local freelance graphic designer.

“What’s the capital of New Zealand again? Is it Aukland or Wellington?”

Rather than open a new tab, type in his question, read the answer and then close the tab, the swashbuckling Lewis felt that he was above that.

A few sheepish seconds past before a Kiwi-born shearing team boss, who was using a hot desk this week to complete the business and individual tax returns of his crew, told him the answer.

“It’s actually Christchurch, bruz,” said the sheepish Kiwi at the end of the communal desk.

Peter paused and looked around the room.

“I’ll just double check that,” he said.

Another pregnant pause swallowed the room.

Peter looked up.

“It’s fucking Wellington, you idiot!” he said laughing to himself.

The Kiwi also smiled.

“Ask stupid questions, get stupid answers.”

Clive Palmer Says He’ll Run The Nation Like A Business

TEXT:

Besieged mining magnate and political hopeful, Clive Palmer, pushed his boat out earlier this week by announcing his triumphant return to public life.

He has the nation’s top job in his sights and has already recruited former One Nation senator Brian Burston to his cause.

Speaking today from his base on our state’s Sunshine Coast, Palmer vowed to run the nation ‘just like a business’.

“I want to make Australia great,” he said to the scrum of four journalists standing beside the 9th tee at Sanctuary Cove.

“And I will run Australia like a business. As a successful businessman myself, as a self-made billionaire, my experience and expertise will naturally make the nation prosper. I am the only true alternative vote in this country. A vote for me is a rejection of the major party nepotism and cronyism,”

“It will be great. All your dreams will come true if you vote for me.”

However, when one reporter present asked if Palmer was going to run the nation like he ran Queensland Nickle, Palmer said no because he was never running Queensland Nickel because he was in parliament at the time.

Another asked if he knew what happened when an entire country’s economy goes into receivership.

Palmer ignored the question.

But he did address the first question, stating that the matter is before the courts.

“I can’t talk about it. If you want answers, I gave them to Leigh Sales a few weeks ago. Go back on iView and check it out if you want. If you want to do your job as a journalist, that is.”

Palmer then called an end to the press conference and departed in a golf cart.

Last Friend Still Talking About Crypto Concedes That The Dream Is Over

TEXT:

There will be no Lamborghini.

No beach house.

No weekend getaways in the private jet, nor models to occupy the Gulfstream’s plush leather seats.

Instead, only broken dreams and a seemingly dead-end job in a field that will cease to exist once next year’s doomsday recession takes hold.

Today has been a bad day for Danny Madigan. Not because the crypto markets crashed again or he saw a photo on Facebook of his ex-girlfriend sitting in the lap of someone much better looking and more successful than he is.

Today Danny finally admitted to himself that cryptocurrency is dead and every dream he had for the future is in the coffin with it.

“It’s like having a sad, heavy weight lifted off my shoulder,” said Danny.

He joined our reporter in the downstairs designated smoking garden here at The Advocate‘s Daroo Street offices just a few hours ago.

Over the course of a few hours, he poured his heart out while a friend counselled him.

“For so long, you couldn’t do any wrong,” he said.

“You put money into crypto and it went up like ten fold in like ten minutes. Now all my money is basically gone. I’ve got nothing left. I’m just about to break even, which is fucked,”

“I should’ve listened to my dad, he said to buy ETFs from large name-brand financial institutions and be thankful for my 5% each year. Fuck, he’s so wise. No wonder he owns a house,”

“I just want what my parents had! But I want it all now!”

Danny then broke down and his friend decided the interview should end there.

Nine’s Sports Arm Renamed ‘Wide World Of Reality TV’ After Losing Rights To Almost Everything

TEXT:

Channel Nine has confirmed today that they will be renaming their iconic and long-running anthology brand the ‘Wide World Of Sports’ (WWOS) this summer.

Nine’s WWOS has rivalled Channel 7’s sporting coverage for decades but is now set to be renamed the ‘Wide World Of Reality Television,’ (WWORT) with executives at the company having already admitted that it doesn’t quite have the same ring to it.

After losing the rights to ‘Nine’s Summer of Cricket’ and falling out of talks over the Australian Open and it’s preliminary tournaments, Channel Nine is now reeling.

This leaves the broadcaster with the rights to the NRL and the State of Origin and maybe the odd swimming championship or the like every now and then.

Channel 7 has been left with the Cricket, the Olympics, International Rugby League, the AFL, Horse Racing and pretty much everything else.

With Kerry Packer rolling in his grave, the Director and CEO of Nine, Hugh Marks sat down with our reporters a short time ago in an exclusive interview with The Advocate.

“Yeah, we have lost some of our iconic sports and failed to secure anything else, so we are really going to focus on our Reality TV arm and try and win the market share there,” he said.

“We can reveal some exciting news. We are actually in talks with Channel 10 to try and by the rights to The Bachelor and The Project. So that’s really promising isn’t it?” he asked our reporters.

They declined to comment.

Marks then explained that Ken Sutcliffe will still be hosting wrap up, highlights and analysis programs with all the weekend’s major action.

“Yeah we will have experts sitting down with Kenny and going over what happened in the Live Auditions, and the Rose Ceremonies and bringing unparalleled analysis and insights,” he said.

“Exciting times ahead.”

We contacted the poor old ABC about the issues and they just tried to spruik their coverage of the bowls.

“Our 5 pm Saturday arvo bowls coverage has a really solid core audience and we are confident we can give Nine a go,” CEO Michelle Guthrie said.

Stan Grant’s Personal Assistant’s Assistant Confident Her Job Will Survive ABC Sell-Off

TEXT:

More than 100 MPs and members are in Sydney for the Liberal Party’s annual federal council which is expected to be the last before the next federal election. The right-wing political classes have already announced several new positions aimed at dealing with any detractors or commentators who might bring their ruling party into disrepute.

Liberal Party members have called on the Turnbull Government to privatise the ABC, after years of having their policies discussed and at times even criticised.

While the public broadcaster continues to restructure itself to provide more bang for tax payer buck, the currents heads of the chopping block continue to be regional outposts that don’t make any sense to anyone living in Balmain or Brunswick.

ABC Landline, rural radio stations and any form of programming that doesn’t involve white inner-city men sitting behind a desk, has been looking like an easy target for the Ultimo head offices to slash for many years now.

However, the 567 social media strategists and deep bureacratic-types hired at the Ultimo head office (colloquially known as The Kremlin) say that they are feeling rather confident in their importance.

Local ABC middle-manager, Sal Shallist, says she’s confident that a sell-off of the ABC would not result in a forced redundancy package for her or her peers.

“There’s literally no more fat to cut” she says.

“The ABC has plenty of random people reporting on bull sales in Longreach and Mt Isa that probably aren’t integral to the national conversation”

Sal says while she admits there is some dead wood within the public broadcaster, her role as Stan Grant’s personal assistant’s assistant definitely isn’t as expendable as other people from other departments.

“Stan Grant’s assistant is stretched thin, that’s why they hired me for $75k per year. To help her out”

“It’s not much when you think about it, especially when there’s entire segments dedicated to providing content for sport and stuff like that”

Farmer’s Knowledge Of The Land Set To Die With Him After Sons Decide Not To Take The Farm On

TEXT:

A popular local grazier has had to come to terms with the fact that all the knowledge he’s gained during his farmer career is probably going to die with him after his youngest son revealed he doesn’t want to follow in his father’s footsteps.

At 68-years-old, Miles Culter had entertained the idea of retirement in the coming years – ushering in a transitional period whereby he’d teach one of his boys the ins-and-outs of primary production for a couple years before stepping off the ship.

The future of the 45 000 ha ‘Caldwell Park’ via Betoota is now unsure.

“My two older boys never showed any interest in the job,” he said.

“The youngest did but he’s since found his calling as a fucking mortgage broker down in Brisbane. So I guess there’s no other option than to sell the place and move into town? My daughter said she’s interested but that’s not how things work out here,”

“If she married a bloke who wanted to take the place on, I’d think about it. Ideally, I’d want the oldest to take it on, keep the family farm in the family but you can’t always get what you want.”

When asked if he’d be open to the idea of teaching the next generation how to create food and raw materials, Miles said he’d be more than happy to – but ultimately lacks the educational prerequisites to teach other people.

Most of the agricultural teachers at North Betoota TAFE College and the Royal School of Agriculture in the Old City District have tertiary teaching qualifications, leaving many people with actual agricultural knowledge out in the cold.

“I could teach a course in animal husbandry, I’ve raised a few animals in my day. I’ve grown a few crops as well. Tell you what, there’s not too many young blokes coming out of ag school who know the pros and cons of direct drilling on the back of 200 points,” said Miles.

“But I can’t because when I did my leaving certificate in 1968, I didn’t get a very good score because all I wanted to do was come back here and be a farmer,”

“All I can hope for now is that the buyer is local and not foreign!”

Survey: 80% Of Inner City Left-Elite Still Kept Awake At Night By The Adler Shotgun

TEXT:

Fresh from complaining about his slightly overcooked $10 rump last night down the Gibbering Elf Club in the Old City District, a perennially-hard-done-by-sexagenarian-property-owner knew he would have trouble sleeping after the unpleasant verbal altercation he had with the bistro manager.

But it wasn’t because he called a 19-year-old girl earning $19.21 an hour a ‘simple bitch’ after she didn’t agree to refund him the $10 for his steak (of which he ate).

It was because of the Adler shotgun.

Though he really, really did not want to do it, our reporter phoned 68-year-old card-carrying Greens Syd Chisholm to speak about the shotgun and not about his behaviour last night.

“I can’t sleep at night knowing that these weapons are on the street,” he said – unaware that a lunch bag full of green banknotes and a knock on a bikie club house’s door can get you something much more useful.

“From where I’m standing, these people, these simple people out in regional Australia don’t need something with that much firepower. I have a hobby farm near Toowoomba with six alpacas on it, I understand that farmers need guns to humanely dispose of livestock and threaten the coal seam gas people,”

“But the Adler is simply a weapon of mass destruction. Who’s hands will have the most blood on them when we have a Columbine-style attack on one of our schools? It certainly won’t be mine.”

Syd Chisholm’s opinion is not dissimilar to that of 80% of people his age.

In fact, in a recent telephone survey conducted by The Advocate, close to 8 in 10 inner-Betoota residents who think they’re better than most are kept awake at night by the Adler Shotgun.

Shockingly, almost every respondent from the survey pool says they wince every time they see a firearm in the flesh – even if it’s on the hip of a soft-eyed police officer.

“This type of thing happens when the left-elite run out of things to be afraid of,” said Tucker Johnson of the Betoota Ponds Pistol Club.

“The only time a regular person would be scared of a gun is if they had a big gambling debt and found a standover man standing over them with a stolen police-issue Glock pressed against their forehead,”

“Then it’s OK to be scared. We’ve all been there, right? Anyway, all I’m trying to say is that this is what happens when people have too much time on their hands. We need to occupy them with another Paddy Pallin sale or something? You know?”

Our reporter said he didn’t, then put the phone down.

Opinion: Here’s Why Racism Might Be Problematic.

TEXT:

It’s fair to say 2018 is probably the worst time ever to be a marginalised minority and it boils down to one simple reason:

Racism.

Now before you go mad in the comment section pissing on about that time during uni that I allegedly threw a cat out of a window for a student film and shouldn’t be getting paid to write opinion pieces, just hear me out.

While once thought of a decent way for a white man to make a quick buck and stand out from the rest, people like me are beginning to realise that racism, when you think about it, is actually quite problematic.

Did you know racism affects approximately 7 billion people a year? That’s right gang, all of us.

Even white people to be fair, but I don’t know anything about those experiences, I only know about the experiences felt by minorities, by watching them happen to them – so that’s all I’m going to write about.

The reason so many of us are able to turn a blind eye to this is because if you’re like me, all of your friends are white – as is everyone on TV – so you might sometimes forget that people miss out on jobs because of their race before they even open their mouth.

The major problem Australia is facing is that people would rather watch The Bachelor than an SBS doco about racism.

Why isn’t there a show where a man has to pick a favourite woman from each race? Surely that would be a lot more relatable.

As it turns out, racism is like domestic contact sport, it’s something we are really good at. Yes guys, I know other countries have it too and it’s just as bad.

I can also confirm that some people of colour even get the words from hip hops songs that I’m not allowed to say, yelled at them. Excuse my appropriation but that shit is wack.

So what can you do about this? How about this, instead of yelling racial insults when you see a person of colour instead tell them how you admire them but it has nothing to do with their race and more to do with something else.

Think about it. They just want their race to matter as not as much as yours does. Give it a try. Try being as colour-blind as I have been since I learnt that expression at uni.

Racism starts with culturally insensitive comments and gaffes. If unchecked, those things can turn into wildly racist legislation and segregation.

So, heads up… Just stop acting like it’s a thing.

One way to do that, as I have learnt, is to make sure you never ask black people if you can touch their hair.

Also never compare your tan to their skin. Never say things like “I’m almost as black as you” during summer… That’s what I’ve learnt.

Girls’ Drinks Enters Hug Phase

TEXT:

It’s Saturday afternoon at the French Quarter’s hottest day club and the girls just ordered another 3 bottles of rose.

“Babe, I love you” one girl was heard saying.

“Nawww, no I love you!” Her friend replied.

Reports from other patron’s state that two women then embraced in a sloppy and prolonged hug. It’s said that the rest of the females in the group then began mimicking the two huggers, as if all reacting to some kind of secret signal that only they could hear.

It’s not yet known what triggered this burst of affection, but what we can confirm is that this is the calm before the storm.

Louise (29), a reformed rose drinker, explained to The Advocate that hugging is just another phase of the Rose effect.

“It starts with the laughing, you know, way louder than usual, higher pitched”

“Then it’s the dick chat.”

“Then, as is happening now, hugging.”

“What happens next can go one of two ways. They accept each other’s love for each other and move on. Or, they spiral into an uncontrollable emotional black hole and confess to things they don’t even mean”

“We might be in luck here though, the Rose they’re drinking is from a slightly warmer region is France which tends to favour a more docile reaction. I guess we’ll see.”

At the time of print, a few of the girls looked to be going down the emotional path – but it’s not yet known if they were crying as a result of laughing, or just crying.

Teenage Townie Transitions Into Manhood With Ritualistic Smiley Burn

TEXT:

Ouchies were had big time at the Gallagher residence last night in Betoota Heights as young Brett Gallagher received a traditional smiley burn on his 18th birthday – ushering in the responsibilities of manhood.

In the backyard of number 34 Rockwood Road, the 18-year-old’s best mate Davo called for hush around 4pm yesterday afternoon to tell the party it was now time for the traditional burning ceremony to take place.

Davo, in his best outside voice, called for a Bic lighter to be thrown to the front of the growing scrum of partygoers around Brett, now rolling up the right sleeve of his best Country Target button down.

“Oi,” bellowed Dave.

“A bit of fucking shush! Ok! It’s time for the smiley! Who’s got a Bic lighter?!”

The party reportedly roared with anticipation.

Mrs Gallagher stood in the back doorway shedding tears that her youngest fuck up was about to become an adult in the eyes of the justice system.

Annie Overell, the middle-daughter of The Advocate’s own editor, Clancy, pulled a pink Bic lighter from her Cotton On clutch and pegged it as hard as she could at Dave – striking him smack back in the palm.

“Are you fucking ready?!” Dave asked the crowd, holding the lit lighter above his head like his parents did at the recent Air Supply concert at the Dolphins Leagues Club.

The party screamed and roared for the burning to take place.

Brett shut his eyes and took a deep breath out.

“Do it, cunt,” he said softly up at Dave.

And with that, the nigh-on-molten lighter was thrust into Brett’s throbbing forearm as everybody hooted and hollered in ecstasy.

“Ahhhhh!!!! Fuuuuuuccccckkkk!!!!” yelled Brett at the top of his lungs.

His father shouted from the back door.

“Ride the lightning, son! You gotta ride that pain out! Yeehaw! That’s my fucking boy, everyone! Yip yeeee!”

Davo ripped the lighter from Brett’s forearm after what seemed an age, taking with it a large amount of charred skin and nerve endings.

But through the pain and distress, Brett managed to find the strength to stand and beat his chest after the ordeal.

The party exploded in unabridged fanfare.

Festivities lasted long into last night and our reporter bid farewell just as Brett and Annie Overell were seen retiring to the skatepark behind his parent’s third-acre block.

Man Begs For The Sweet Release Of Death After Mistaking Intermission For The End Of Amateur Theatre Production

TEXT:

With just a minced California roll and two glasses of pinot noir sloshing around inside him, a Betoota Heights car salesman agreed to attend the theatre last night on short notice with his new flame.

He says he can get you a great price on a new Landcruiser and offer you a great deal on your trade-in – but if you want him to explain the difference between Colin ‘Funky’ Miller and Arthur Miller – Kevin Palmer says keep on walking.

“This bird asked me for my number after I spoke at the Simpson Desert Auto Sales Conference a few weeks ago, which takes a lot of the guesswork out of the whole thing for me, you know?” he said.

“Which naturally means I’ll do anything she says or wants me to do because I’m 37 and I fear the music in this charade of musical chairs we call life is about to stop. Which I guess is how I found myself mildly buzzed at the theatre house last night watching a low rent production of A Streetcar Named Desire,”

“They didn’t even have a car it was that shit.”

But that’s not the worst part, according to poor Kevin.

He revealed to The Advocate that he mistook the intermission for the end of the show, making a complete fool of himself in the process.

Explaining what happened next to our reporter with spirited hand gestures and much shouting, he said his new coital partner Denise looked over at him with a mild disgust that only a person who’s seen you naked can have.

“I basically said, ‘Oh hey wow! Great show, babe. How random was that ending, huh?’ and she just looked at me like I’d basically undone my belt, walked out into the aisle, squatted, then expelled a plump carpet python out of myself right then and there,” he explained, taking the time to gesture the faeces coming out of his body.

“Needless to say that didn’t go down well. Other people who heard me just cough laughed like Malcolm Turnbull does when people tell him how bad the traffic and knife crime is out in Western Sydney,”

“So anyway, we went down and got more drinks, she didn’t even look at me the whole time. The rest of the night, I was honestly clenching my entire body tightly, forcing blood into my brain in the hopes that I’d have an enormous, unbridged stroke – or an aneurysm would pop and the sweet release of death would wash over me like a good set of three-foot shories. A man can only dream.”

From there, Kevin said, he dropped his adult friend off at her place. She didn’t even say goodbye.

So he smiled, unlocked his phone, deleted her number and put it into first.

“Oh well.”

Cotton Farmer’s Son ‘Livid’ After Dad Buys Him The Wrong Mercedes Benz Ute

TEXT:

A popular Hebel-area farmer’s son has lashed out at his father this morning after it’s been revealed that he accidentally purchased the wrong model Mercedes Benz ute that he’d been asking for his birthday.

Gavin Tucker, of Tucker Queensland Cotton Pty Ltd, said he instructed his father to get him a ‘new’ Merc ute to replace his ageing MY16 SV6 ute.

However, it seems Peter Tucker didn’t get the full memo.

Speaking exclusively to The Advocate this afternoon, Peter said up until his son’s blow up, he didn’t even know the German car manufacturer made utes.

“That’s what made me scratch my head,” said Peter via telephone.

“So I called up my car broker and he shrugged his shoulders as well. So I hit the Google and had a bit of a look about and found a Mercedes conversion in Rockhampton. I thought I was going to make Gav’s birthday dreams come true,”

“Instead, I’ve left them in tatters.”

What happened this morning on the state-boundary block was nothing short of biblical, according to the 68-year-old.

“So Gav’s come out of the house, thinking there’s $100k worth of Panzer ute in the turning circle. He’s seen the ute I bought him and he’s just gone off the handle. Throwing himself around in the dirt, taking fistfuls of dust and throwing them into his wide-open eyes. The writhing around, screaming, shouting and hollering,”

“You’d think he’d just been roshambo’d by Sterling Mortlock or something. Jesus wept, I didn’t know what I’d done wrong.”

Once he’d sufficiently calmed down to the point where he could hold a conversation, Gavin also spoke candidly to The Advocate today via telephone.

“I mean, the mind boggles. Doesn’t it?” said Gavin.

“When I told him I wanted a new Mercedes Benz ute, I meant a new Mercedes Benz ute. Not that purple slug with the fucking 19-inch rims on the cunt! It’s nigh on fucking 20-year-old! You’d be lucky to get into Goodooga before the thing blew up!”

“It’s such a piece of shit, it had to come out here on the fucking low-loader! What am I supposed to do with this wookatook looking thing? I might as well comprehensively insurance and drive it into an irrigation channel! Fuck my life.”

Gavin then slammed the phone down, thus terminating the interview.

Wallabies Fan Still Dirty At Team For Winning And Ruining His Multi

A mildly-unpopular doctor’s son has lashed out at the in-form Wallabies this morning after he revealed to friends and family that he would’ve won ‘a significant amount of money’ on a weekend multi-bet if the boys in gold went down to Ireland on Saturday night.

“Very annoyed still,” said Curtis Mullholland III, a 28-year-old full-time-stay-at-home-son who enjoys the finer things in life such as his parent’s heated pool and gambling beyond his means.

“I love the Wallabies but I love money more. I had Ireland by 13 and they choked. I got every other tip right except for that game,”

“My mates said I deserve it for gambling against the fellas but yeah, I’m just trying to be smart about my punting. We went out on Dad’s boat the next day – which is something I love more than a DFO Lacoste sale – and even that failed to cheer me up.”

With that historic win, the national rugby union team leap-frogs the floundering English team to be ranked third behind the All-Blacks and the Irish.

Asked if he’d be willing to be against the Wallabies in their next contest this weekend, Mulholland said he’d weigh up his options.

“I’m not sure yet, but I’d imagine they’ll let them win so they’d be able to sell tickets to the third Test. Nothing is what it seems in the world of sport.”

First-Year Knows He Shouldn’t Be Looking At The Welding – But Can’t Help Himself

TEXT:

“It feels like someone’s thrown sand in my eyes,” he said.

And he told our reporters who knows who that person is.

Himself.

Working yesterday on a local residential building site, Dennis Hardy said his boss told him not to look at people welding because it’s not good for your eyes.

He caught him looking at the welders working more than once, he even had to raise his voice.

“Dennis! Stop looking at those blokes! You’ll be sorry! You’ll get the flash if you’re not careful.”

Speaking candidly to our reporter today from his Betoota Ponds couch, the 21-year-old aspiring tradesman admitted that he knew he shouldn’t be looking at the ‘forbidden light’ as he calls it – but he just couldn’t help himself.

“It’s like,” he prefaced.

“If someone tells you not to look at something or do something, if you’re anything like me, you’re going to look at it or do it,”

“I’ve brought this upon myself and there’s nobody else to blame but me.”

Dennis’ flash is so bad today, he had to ring his boss and tell him the humiliating tale as to why he can’t come to work today.

Shortly after speaking to young Dennis, our reporter caught up with his boss to speak about what happened yesterday.

“I told him not to look at the forbidden light, now I’m a bloke down today,” said Wallace Greensborough, the site foreman.

“He’s a moron and I hope he learned his lesson. It’s like burning a kids hand on the stove to prove a point. Anyway, I’ve got two trucks of cement coming in ten minutes so I’ll let you go.”

Colourblind Man Urged To Explain What Random Object Looks Like

TEXT:

Financial advisor Campbell Hislock (34) is furious at himself for telling co-workers about his colourblindness as he has now been given the responsibility to explain what random objects look like to him on a daily basis.

Since casually mentioning his visual impairment that means he sees the colour green as more of a grey, Hislock has found himself inundated with requests from his colleagues about what green objects look like to him.

Hislock estimates he has had to give his opinion on the colour of a dozen water bottles, six staplers, 40 coffee cups, one handbag and every piece of stationary in the storeroom.

“They find it fascinating,” droned the dead-eyed shadow of a man.

“The answer is always grey. Every time. But they still keep asking me.”

Partial to the odd game of “what colour is this?” is Hislock’s boss Susan Granger (44) who has confirmed his status as a colourblind man since the rueful day he let it slip.

“We are an equal opportunities workplace and he’s a great financial advisor,” stated Granger.

“To think he couldn’t become a pilot is just upsetting. I don’t think he ever wanted to be a pilot but still sad.”

OPINION: Are Three-Wheeled Scooters Making Our Kids Soft?

TEXT:

“Yes,” he said.

“If you buy your kid a three-wheeled scooter because they can’t ride a two-wheeled variety, you are setting your child up for failure.”

That’s the opinion of a parent who is too broke to be a yuppie.

Learning to ride a bike or scooter should be punctuated with skinned knees, elbows and undiagnosed mild concussions – not hugs and kisses.

A child that rides a three-wheeled scooter is a wimp destined to live a life within the safe harbour of mediocrity and guilty privilege.

Speaking exclusively to The Advocate in his nauseatingly smooth voice, popular local child psychologist Michael Blue-Septum agreed with the sentiments of said broke yuppie.

“If you want my learned opinion, buying a kid a three-wheeled scooter makes them weak,” he said.

“They’re the type of kids who play soccer. You learn nothing about life by playing that game. Look at America. They suck at soccer but are really good at war. Every country that is good at soccer is also great at losing wars. Same can be said about those tricycle scooters,”

“Would a kid who grew up on a three-wheeled scooter have it in him to bayonet a Russian teenager? Because he’s going to need that pizzazz in twenty years when it all kids off. Jesus wept.”

The Advocate reached out to a polite city worker who bought his son a three-wheeled scooter for his birthday but he couldn’t stop crying after watching Castaway.

Property Owners Put End To Son’s Fortnite Addiction After Learning It’s Killing The NBN

TEXT:

“Tyler!” he screamed up the stairs.

“Tyler! You better not be playing that fucking game!”

Tyler was playing that fucking game.

In a statement made earlier this week – or last week sometime – the NBN chief, Bill Morrow, took time out of his busy schedule of shitting the bed around the nation to tell taxpayers that their NBN was being killed by young people and their unquenchable thirst to play online video games.

And that did not sit well with Tyler’s father, John Meeks.

Like most hard-working Baby Boomers of his ilk, he pays his taxes and feels his offspring have it too easy.

Enter Tyler, a directionless, perennially anxious 15-year-old Betoota Heights high school student who finds comfort in escaping this hellscape of a planet through video games.

However, after the declaration made by Morrow regarding computer gamers and their malignant presence on the nation’s internet infrastructure, John decided this afternoon to put the fun and games to an end.

“You’re ruining the internet,” said John – moments after bursting into his son’s room with barely a knock.

“Get off the computer now. You’re supposed to be doing homework, anyway. This isn’t homework, this is shit.”

Tyler’s mother, Butter, followed her husband up the stairs to join in the emotional stacks-on.

“Is this why your marks have gone down?” she barked standing over her son.

“I’m so disappointed and angry. Your father and I put so much effort into raising you right and you throw it right back in our face! No wonder I can’t watch my shows on Netflix! You are so selfish!”

Butter sighed and told John to confiscate their son’s computer.

He did so and the parents left Tyler alone in his room with only his smartphone to entertain him.

Shortly after he noticed our reporter standing out in the unit complex’s communal garden, Tyler came to the window and drew the curtain.

“Shows over, fuck face,” said Tyler to our reporter.

Frydenberg: BoM Pay Freeze ‘Not The Result Of Being Critical Of Government Climate Policy’

TEXT:

Staff at the Bureau of Meteorology have suffered the same relative fate as their broadcasting cousins today after plans to freeze their pay for the next five years has become public.

A growing number of employees at the nation’s peak meteorological organisation are joining a strike, which is supported by a petition to give the weather-folk what they deserve.

Many in the industry have chalked up the pay freeze to the Bureau’s continued attacks on the Coalition government’s climate policy and their collective blasé attitude toward publishing evidence of climate change.

“That’s not the case,” said Environment Minister Josh Frydenberg.

The swashbuckling Victorian Liberal addressed the media today in Canberra, where he hit back at the green left hypocrites who love spending money that isn’t theirs to spend.

“Their funding hasn’t been slashed, it’s just been put on hold. It’s also got nothing to do with their internal politics toward climate change or what have you. This is simple economics, it is about delivering the budget to surplus by 2019. I used to be a banker, I’ve got an MBA from Harvard, I’ll fucking shirtfront you into 2019, my opinion is right and your home-job tattoo opinion is wrong and invalid,”

“All I’m trying to say is, you mess with the bull, you get the horns, fucko. Look what happened with the ABC. They didn’t toe the company line, now the mortgages on their Glebe townhouses will probably default. Does it look like I give a fuck about that? Run at me, Barry Cassidy. You want a pay rise? Start predicting the weather correctly and stop publishing lies about the climate. Frydenberg out.”

The Advocate reached out to the Office of the Minister for the Environment for clarification on his comments earlier but was told to he still hadn’t calmed down sufficiently to field further questions from the media.

Our reporter also tried to get further comment from the Bureau of Meteorology but was told the government had bugged their phones and staff would be swiftly beaten and stomped on by jackbooted Treasury workers for speaking out.

Local Indie Surf-Pop-Rock Band Makes Waves With Lyrics That People Can Actually Understand

TEXT:

They’ve been playing the Simpson Desert music scene for a number of years now but for French Quarter surf-pop-rock outfit, The Gurning Goblins, success has always eluded them.

Until now.

Frontman Sock Davidson sat down exclusively with our least qualified and most unnecessary member of The Advocate‘s staff, the music reporter, to chat about the nipple of success they’ve recently found themselves suckling from.

“Yeah, weird metaphor, but I’ll take it,” said Sock.

“So yeah, bro. We basically just started singing clearly into the microphone. You know, like, loud and clear. I used to mumble a bit when I sang to make up for the fact I’m not Michael Hutchence, know what I’m saying?”

“That motherfucker could sing. Burn For You makes me naturally gurn. I can’t drive and listen to it at the same time. Anyway, for this new album, we just made a point of having some singing lessons, paying someone who isn’t a DJ mate to master the record and then we were away.”

The local quartet is playing a series of sold-out shows this weekend around town.

Interim Triple J music director, Tony Jones, is rumoured to be attending tonight’s show at the Heroin & Spoon Hotel in Betoota Heights.

Something that makes keyboard and kazoo operator, Goink Pearson, quite nervous.

“Fuck how good would it be if we got played on Triple J,” he said.

“Hope we impress Tony, his musical opinion of us will dictate whether I make a living out of music or if I’ll have to sell my Korg, throw the kazoo in the creek and get a job at the meatworks after this thing all blows over,”

“I’d like to do a tour, though. Doing the Darling Downs and the Warrego would be great.”

Local Rugby League Team Buys Scrum Machine Just For A Laugh

TEXT:

The President of the Dolphins Leagues Club in Betoota Heights has lashed out and purchased a scrum machine which has brought much joy to people around town.

Not because President Mitchell Curtis wanted to help his boys with their scrum work, he bought the machine just for a laugh.

Traditionally, the rugby league scrum is much less intense than the one seen in the blue blood variation of the sport.

Almost no self-respecting league club in the country would own a scrum machine, according to Curtis.

“That’s what makes it funny,” he laughed.

“I’ve seen the fourth-grade lads pack down against it. They bloody near stood there for fifteen minutes trying to work out how the thing works! [laughs] Jesus fucking wept, mate. I’ll tell you what. Go down there and have a look for yourself,”

“I don’t know why I didn’t think of doing it sooner. Shit it’s funny. Go look at them!”

However, not everybody is laughing.

One man who’s spoken out against the newest white elephant in the club is Treasurer Liam Buswell.

He’s not sure if spending $1900 on a piece of equipment nobody knows how to or particularly wants to use is very good for the club both socially and financially.

“There’s a perfectly good one that the union boys use just over there,” he said, pointing.

“Look, I don’t mean the be the shit on the shoe here and suck the fun out of it but come the fuck on, Bridget. That’s a lot of money to spend on nothing,”

“The club’s been looking to buy a courtesy bus and that $1900 is at least half a clapped out Hiace?”

CSIRO Launch Study Into Why Dropped Handbags Always Land Upside Down

TEXT:

“Fuck!” she said sharply.

“Fuck!”

Lucy Taylor’s handbag fell off the table and predictably lands upside down – in the middle of a French Quarter cafe.

Her most private possessions, some she didn’t even know she had, are now on public display for all to see.

Everyday items like her comb, hairpins, cigarettes, makeup and an unregistered Glock 23 lay on the floor for a few seconds before the 24-year-old swept them back up.

“Why do they always land upside fucking down?” she asked her friend.

The friend smiled and shrugged.

“Why don’t you do the zipper up?”

Lucy rolled her eyes and checked the safety was still on with her idle left hand.

Questions like this are set to be answered by a new landmark study conducted by Australia’s peak scientific body, which kicks off today in the south.

Speaking exclusively to The Advocate this morning, Gavin Spoon from the CSIRO said he and his colleagues look forward to finding answers for young, anxious people like Lucy.

“Only nerds zip up their handbag,” said Gavin.

“And as nerds only make up a tiny fraction of the population, that leaves many young Australians exposed to the dangers of dropped handbags.”

When asked if that includes men who use cute handbags and clutches day-to-day, Gavin looked confused.

“Girls have handbags, men have briefcases. If you’re walking around all day with your briefcase open, you need to get your head read. We’re living under an LNP government, there will no chit-chat of that nature. If you’re a bloke living in far western Queensland that keeps his man things in a hard-wearing Longchamp handbag, then you’re a bigger man than me!”

The study is expected to cost about $60 and take roughly a week.

Morbidly Obese Office Worker Surprisingly Confident Of His Chances In A Zombie Apocalypse

TEXT:

A local sales executive and current office foosball champion is convinced that his natural sales acumen and ability to write emails that are both friendly AND professional means he would absolutely crush it in any zombie apocalypse scenario, it is being reported.

Michael ‘Dragon’ Draginski, a 27 year old Sales Exec at a Betoota IT firm who several eyewitnesses claim picked his own nickname, is absolutely adamant that should society crumble tomorrow due to the release of a deadly plague which turns almost everyone on the planet into mindless zombies, he’d have the perfect skillset to survive and thrive in the new world that would emerge.

“I mean, if you really think about it, there is so much overlap between Zombie Apocalypses and Inside Sales”, said Mr. Draginski, when during an argument with another fat as hell coworker, Jack Peeler, who doesn’t believe asked a man who needs to have a latte every morning could possibly make it in a world where there are undead beasts trying to eat him.

“I mean, when I’m trying to sell our product, I often face a ton of resistance – people always start out adamant that they don’t need more anti-virus software. However, I almost always manage to wear them down long enough to change their minds”

“How different could it really be with a zombie? Like when a zombie talks about how it wants ‘brains’ all the time, does it really need brains? Or are ‘brains’ just what they think they need due to clever marketing by our competitors? I guarantee I can convince that zombie that brains are not the solution it needs right now, and it should instead look into getting some of our anti-virus software”

Mr. Draginksi claims that the unique insight into human interaction he gains from his role, on a daily basis, is the perfect foundation for learning how to deal with the living dead.

“In many ways, zombies and office workers are really similar. I mean, one are soulless husks of human beings with very little drive or motivation in life other than to slowly amble along in a stagnant and ultimately meaningless quest for some goal that won’t satisfy them anyway. And then zombies are like that as well”

Mr. Draginski is hoping he can use his natural people skills to really help him connect with and understand the zombies, and to hopefully get what he wants out of them.

“Ultimately, it’s all about building relationships, which I am really really good at. Once the zombies know how fun and cool I am, while also being a complete pro, they’ll almost definitely not want to eat me. And if any one of them is having an IT-related issues, well, that’s a two-for-one”

Fancy Man On Health Kick Treats Himself To A Refreshing Longneck Of San Pellegrino After Work

TEXT:

He’s told just about everyone so far but there’s one person he hasn’t told about his new health kick.

In his own words, that person is himself.

“I’m on a grog holiday,” he said to nobody in particular.

In the hours before an Origin showdown, he wasn’t expecting much of a rise out of his thirsty coworkers – all eyeing off the free beer chilling in the kitchenette fridge.

For Mabel Foster, these types of office drinks parties are now much more laborious that they need to be because of his newfound teetotaling.

As it’s past five on a a Friday, he had fair thirst building in the back of this throat but somehow the thirst didn’t reach up into his frayed mind.

“I need a drink,” he thought to himself.

So he slipped out, rode the ThyssenKrupp down to ground and walked into the newsagency across the road.

However, this wasn’t a European newsagency, there weren’t any beers, cigarettes of ribbed condoms to be seen. Just soft drinks, stationery and broken dreams of a bygone era.

Mabel looked the fridges up and down then smiled.

He opened the door and pulled a longneck of sparkling Italian mineral water from the fridge and read the label.

“Yes, this will do,” he said to himself.

Looking down at the price, he smiled to himself again.

“$8.30, it must be good.”

Stepping back out onto Mulbury Road, Foster cracked the top and had a deep, pensive swig from the bottle and made sure to ‘ahhh’ on the way out.

“This is fucking fantastic,” he said.

James Sutherland To Return To His Old Job As Bunnings Sandpaper Specialist

TEXT:

Outgoing Cricket Australia CEO James Sutherland announced his resignation earlier today, making the administrator the latest high-profile scalp to be claimed by the ball-tampering saga of last summer.

Though he claims it has nothing to do with his decision, Sutherland told reporters today in the south that he feels it’s a good time for him – and a good time for the game for him to finish his innings.

When asked what he planned to do next, Sutherland said he plans to retire and work part-time.

As the sandpaper specialist at his local Bunnings.

“I held that job for many years,” said Sutherland.

“But it had nothing to do with the ball tampering last summer, it’s just a coincidence. Albeit as largely unbelievable coincidence. But I digress, I came to the conclusion earlier this week that I’d done all I could as the boss of cricket in this country,”

“Regardless, I’m looking forward to returning to the old job I had back before I got mixed up in the bright lights of the sports administration world. I might even start playing again? Lastly, I’d like to thank Cricket Australia for giving me the opportunity to resign on my own accord and to the fans. Cheers.”

Sutherland then told a Channel Nine reporter to go fuck himself before flipping off the whole media pack.

More not coming, probably.

Dolphin Looks Forward To Seeing What New Reusable Plastic Bags Taste Like

TEXT:

One of the seven bottlenose dolphins that calls the town’s only saltwater bore drain home has telepathically spoken to The Advocate via drugs this afternoon about the new reusable plastic bags at local supermarkets and what they might taste like.

The Betoota Heights Woolworths is due to dump single-use plastic bags later this month in an effort to minimise the soulless multinational’s impact on the environment.

And in their place, hardier plastic bags which can be used more than once.

Our reporter caught up with a representative from the Fresh Foodkin a short time ago about the change.

“There’s also hessian ones,” said Woolies store manager Boing D’amato.

“Which is a natural fibre, so that’ll break down in the dolphin’s tummy no problemos. We’re moving forward to the next chapter of our esteemed history as the nation’s fresh food people and keeping those prices down, down,”

“So you tell that dolphin a change is coming!”

Before our reporter hit the road, bound for the saltwater bore drain, he purchased four BBQ chickens and a large pot of readymade pasta salad to feed to the popular aquatic mammals.

After devouring a whole hot chook in a matter of seconds, Fred the bottlenose dolphin said he’s looking forward to having a different type of plastic drifting around his home – and is curious to know what it will taste like.

“I’m a bit sick of these single-use bags, I’ve been eating them for years,” he said.

“Don’t get me wrong, I enjoy them as much as the next dolphin but I’ve had enough to last me a lifetime. I’ll be 2 years old in July and that’s basically all I’ve had to eat besides the odd Barra and barbeque chicken. So yeah, you could say I’m looking forward to eating one of these new tough bags,”

“Yeah, but nah, though. Can you stuff one of those chooks with pasta salad and chuck it to me? I love pasta salad.”

Disappointment As Podcast Reaches Good Part Just When Woman-About-Town Gets Home

TEXT:

Grace Sherlock toyed with the idea of walking around the block a few times but ultimately decided to press pause and put her feet up.

Walking home this afternoon with the warm Simpson Desert sunshine on her shoulders, the content of her podcast was anything but.

She spoke to The Advocate a short time ago via mobile telephone.

“It’s about this girl that got abducted in Ohio in like the 70s, it’s really full-on but so interesting at the same times,” she said.

“I don’t want to give too much away but it sounds like the police force was complicate in the cover-up and the whole justice system was full of rot at the time – but this intrepid young journalist from New York was determined to get to the bottom of it,”

“So when I was getting home from work this morning, like just as I was walking in the door, they dropped a bombshell on us that was so big I considered walking around the block a few times to hear it.”

When asked if she could’ve just listened to the rest of the episode in the comfort of her own home, Grace laughed and said only freaks and weirdos listen to podcasts at home.

The 24-year-old swashbuckling design student took the time to explain her point of view and why people of her ilk only listen to podcasts when they’re on the move.

“Otherwise they’re boring as hell. You have to be doing something, like walking or jogging, while you’re listening to a podcast because your mind wonders if you don’t.”

One podcast that Grace recommends is The Betoota Advocate Podcast, which is recorded weekly at the Koala Mattress Studio within Desert Rock FM, Betoota’s second-oldest classic hits radio station. 

This week’s show was with Hollywood actor Luke Bracey, who spoke to The Advocate’s editors about life in Los Angeles, how he got his start in the industry as well as tomorrow’s Origin showdown between the Queensland Maroons and the NSW Spoonmen.

Just When Bloke Thought Bullshitting Man’s Yarn Couldn’t Get Any Better – It Does

TEXT:

Though there’s absolutely no way any of what he’s saying actually happened, that didn’t perturb a young drinker from plough on through his yarn as it dipped, ducked and dived between mundane reality and pure imagination.

Speaking candidly to a small group of friends last Saturday night in the designated smoking area of the Betoota Dolphins Club, Peter Coolie spoke of the time he found himself staring down the barrel of a long stretch in an Indonesia prison – only to be saved at the last minute.

“My uncle was in the SAS for like twenty years and now he’s a kidnap and ransom specialist. That movie with Russel Crowe and Meg Ryan was actually based on him,” he said.

Both Dylan Harrison and Dale Peckham both looked at each other and smiled. As they stood opposite Peter, they relished in being witness to yet another Peter yarn.

“So anyway, I got framed for murder by these triads and then we basically had to bribe and then threaten the chief of police on this small island, one that’s not even on Google Maps. I can’t remember the name, something like Lobok or something? I dunno,”

“Anyway, my uncle chartered a Hercules from the RAAF in Darwin, he knew an ex-SAS guy who now flies C-130s out of the Top End. Anyway, they were about to parachute down to break me out but my Mum’s cousin, Alexander Downer, called his old friends in the service who got me out.”

Dylan laughed while Dale took another swig from his Heineken.

Looking chuffed, Peter also joined in the laughing, under the impression that they both believed the story.

“Nice, bro,” said Dale.

“I’m banned from going to the US because of my history of violent crime, could your Mum’s cousin Alexander Downer help me get a visa?”

Peter stopped laughing.

“I mean, I could try. I’ll ask him for you.”

Dale looked over at Dylan again, seconds before the pair exploded into laughter.

Man Serving 30 Days In Facebook Jail For Spicy Memes Says It’ll Take More Than That To Silence Him

TEXT:

What he posted can’t be repeated – but it prompted a visit from two detectives and a month-long ban from Facebook.

Around 6pm last night, two junior Queensland police detectives from a Diamantina Area Command paid a visit to Darren Goldman’s Betoota Heights Californian bungalow to speak to him about a very spicy meme he posted about the upcoming byelections.

“It wasn’t even that bad,” he said.

The 34-year-old spoke to The Advocate this morning about last night and what he plans to do now he’s been locked up in Facebook jail.

“It’ll take more than a 30-day ban to silence me. You can’t call yourself a meme maker if you haven’t been banned from Facebook. If you haven’t, you’re just a poser,”

“As for what was in the meme that got me banned, I can’t legally explain that to you right now but I’ll give you the gist. It was very explicit and made allusions to bestiality and political incest. I can understand why these Facebook normies hated it. Honestly, if half my friends saw it, it’d make their toes curl off.”

Which lead Darren to his next point, where he said that he didn’t post the meme from his personal account but from a ‘meme-de-plume’.

“That’s how I knew it was dodgy. The only was the coppers would’ve known it was me was if Facebook gave me up – which they obviously did, the dogs,”

“And to answer your other question, no, I don’t plan on stopping. If they boot me off Facebook altogether, I can go hang out with all the other narcissistic freakazoids on Twitter.”

Milk From Rudd-Era Discovered In Local Sharehouse Fridge

TEXT:

To say the scene was confronting is an understatement – that’s according to Capt. Damien Rustle from the Betoota Hills Fire Authority.

From shocking car wrecks to fires that burned a million wild acres of nothing, Captain Rustle has seen all that a man of his ilk could ever see.

“But that milk. Man, it really cut through me. Mother of God and her Mum, too. I’m sorry, mate, but I can’t find the words.”

Those were the words of a 30-year veteran of the fire authority, now sitting in the gutter, who was present when a two-litre jug of milk from 2008 was discovered and disarmed by specialists from the Charleville Police Bomb Squad.

The Rudd-era milk was found by the occupants of a Betoota Hills student sharehouse that’s been handed down from friend to friend, brother to brother for a countless number of years.

Shortly after the discovery, emergency services were dispatched to the address and the heroic first responders went to work neutralising the threat.

Disturbingly, however, the occupants of the sharehouse elected to keep the milk after a police analysis of the dairy product determined that it was now potently alcoholic.

“They said they were going to drink it for pres tonight,” said Capt. Rustle.

“Jesus wept, mate,”

He paused.

“What’s wrong with these fucking Millennials? That milk came out of the cow when they were in high school. You shouldn’t drink it!”

Rustle then began dry heaving while our reporter rubbed his back.

The gaggle of guys dawdled their way down the hill to the French Quarter after seeing their football team be thrashed at the hands of the Windorah Spacemen – something that’s become a weekly occurrence.

However, says Mike, it doesn’t excuse some of his friendship circle subscribing to the slow walking life.

He ran into our reporter at the intersection of Jones Avenue and Rue Du Putain in Betoota Hills while he waited for the rest of his mates to catch up.

“Honestly, it does my tiny head it, it does,” said Mike.

“How can people walk so slowly? We all have places to be and rocks to throw. It’s a nice winter day, hovering around 20 but come on. They’ll be the death of me. Steve especially. If he was going and slower, he’d be fucking near going backwards, I tell you.”

Our reporter left Mike just as his friends caught up to him at the lights.

He watched them take off down the hill, Mike out in the front talking back over his shoulder at them. More than once, he turned to walk backwards as he spoke to them, in an obvious, pure frustration that only he and our reporter would ever know about.

Couple Straight Back Into It After First Baby Fails To Hit 100 Likes

New parents Leah and James Finbar state they are immediately trying for a second child after the birth announcement of their first child failed to get over 100 likes.

Announcing the arrival of their daughter Juniper May Finbar (0) on their respective Facebook and Instagram accounts, the couple was shocked when 24 hours later not a single post had managed to get over 100 likes.

“I can’t believe it,” chocked the new mother Leah Finbar (27) from her hospital bed.

“Nine months of pregnancy, 34 hours of labour and all I have to show for it is 53 likes, 34 heart, a wow react from my cousin Matilda and a daughter I named ‘Juniper’ because I thought it would play better with my old uni friends.”

Agreeing these results were not good enough, the Finbar’s state they will immediately start trying for another baby the next second they are alone.

“Yeah, I’m keen. I haven’t had sex in six months, this pregnancy has been hard on me too you know.” stated James Finbar (26).

Acknowledging that giving birth was an intense experience every bit as painful as she was ever told, Leah Finbar is determined to do right by her family and get a birth announcement post that gets the attention it deserves.

“Look, my vagina is in pieces but that’s not going to stop me having a kid worth the adoration of my distant relatives and ex-coworkers.”

Friends and family of the couple have stated that two days after the birth is far to soon to start trying for a second child, but James Finbar stated they should keep their opinions to themselves and like his post if they haven’t already.

“By trying again, we’re showing Juniper that we won’t be raising a quitter. She’s sad about it too, hasn’t stopped crying has she?”

In a Betoota Advocate exclusive, we can also reveal the ‘happy couple’ have big plans ready for the announcement post for their second child when it arrives in “hopefully 10 months or less.”

“Gonna have big sister Juniper holding the new little bub. If that doesn’t get at least 100 likes I’m gonna start googling orphanages near me.”

“Only joking. But seriously, if it doesn’t I don’t know what I’ll do.”

Young-At-Heart Parents Show Their Age Packing For Holiday Two Weeks Early

TEXT:

Upper Betoota Gardens couple, Simon and Shell Brogue, have really shown their age today by laying out clothes and other miscellaneous items on their spare bed in anticipation of their upcoming holiday.

While this may seem like a simple organisation technique that’s not specific to any particular age group, where Simon and Shell exposed themselves was by doing it two weeks early.

The couple’s senior tendencies were discovered by their youngest daughter, Jenny (21), who was over under the guise of visiting her parents but really just dropping off washing and sticking around long enough for dinner.

“I saw all the clothes on the bed and just thought ‘fuck, are my parents that old now?’” She explained to the Advocate.

“Like, you know your parents are getting old…”

“I just didn’t realise they were that far gone”

According to Shell, she just likes to be organised. It has nothing to do with her age.

“I’d do this if I was 20” said the 65-year-old.

“I don’t know what she’s talking about, Shell packs for me.” Added Simon.

“It just makes sense, I’ve been pottering around picking up bits here and there as I think of them. It beats a mad rush at the end!”

Shell nearly had our reporter convinced that she wasn’t that old, but it was her last statement that exposed her; only an old person would think in that way.

Another Pair Of Local Woman’s Shoes Lost To Dancefloor Residue

TEXT:

Kirstin Fischer has this morning woken up with double the hangover. Not only does it feel like someone has lodged a pick into her skull, but she has discovered that she has lost yet another pair of nude high heels to that weird black stuff on the dance floor.

Kirstin, who spent her night club hopping along Betoota’s main night club strip, believes the venue that’s likely responsible for the residue is her favourite club, Reptile.

While the vibe at Reptile is unmatched, their cleanliness leaves a lot to be desired.

“It’s like they’ve never mopped the floor!” Kirstin moaned over the phone to our reporter.

“Like, what even is this shit? Do you know a scientist? Can you get it tested?”

Luckily for Kirstin the Advocate has extremely strong ties with Australia’s peak scientific body, the CSIRO, so we were able to send a sample down to them for testing.

“It’s quite fascinating really” said Dr. Martin.

“I believe it was once a rum and coke, but over the past decade it has evolved into something much more”

“The sample you sent me has developed a complex bacteria culture, likely due to the constant flow of artificially sweetened alcoholic beverages”

“I suppose the nearest comparison, for the layman, would be Kombucha”

“Although [haha] I would strongly advise against drinking this. You will die”

Despite Dr. Martin’s intriguing discovery, Ms. Fischer’s shoes, and those of every other female, are no safer than they were before. The Advocate understands that the Tough Stains division of the CSIRO have taken over Dr. Martin’s research and are working on a solution.

“This Is Just The Beginning” Says Eliminated Reality TV Contestant Nobody Will Hear Of Again

TEXT:

Sometime last year, Gilbert Boing was eliminated from Channel 10’s Survivor and on that warm tropical night his torch was extinguished – he promised that ‘this’ was just the beginning.

Countless long months later, the nation still hasn’t heard anything from the 34-year-old chimney sweep, which is leading many to believe that it was indeed the last we’ll ever see of him.

“I got in the newspaper last year,” he said.

“Not just this one but a big major one down in the city.”

The incident Mr Boing is referring to is his arrest earlier this year for throwing rocks at buses and iron ore trains.

“Nothing to be proud of,” he added.

“But the nation did hear from me again. I kept my word!”

When asked if he had any plans to reignite his fledgeling career in entertainment, Boing said he clung to hope that he’d be invited back on Survivor for a special, such as Villians vs Angels or Celebrity Survivor.

Either that, he said, or he plans to go mad in a public so the police would have to shoot him.

“That would certainly be the end! [laughs]”

Man Returns Home From Work To Learn He’s Now On His Partner’s New Diet

“I’m doing the GLUMAP-free diet,” she said.

“It’d also be really good if you could do it with me, seeing as though it’d remove all temptations! [laughs]”

Mark said he’d just pulled his headphones out walking up the steps to his first skid-row apartment on the edge of the Old City District when he received the news.

“So what does that mean?” he asked.

His partner-of-a-year-or-so, Debbie Motrosh, smiled at him and shut the fridge.

“Basically,” she prefaced.

“It’s no alcohol, grains, dairy, sugar, ketamine, red meat, white meat or seafood caught in a net,” she said.

“So for dinner tonight, I’ve made a bean stew with grapefruit bread as a side. There’s lemon water in the fridge if you’re thirsty and need something a bit sweet and malty to tell your brain it’s knockoff time!”

Moments earlier, Mark toyed with the idea of picking up a roast chook, one on-special baguette that’s already stiffer than a star picket, a pot of name-brand coleslaw and a stick of full-fat salted butter for dinner but remembered he had some mild taco mince, half a bottle of cleanskin gin and two blue-hued Peter Stuyvesants on the dresser – so he held off.

“Is that just when I’m here? Like at home?” he asked.

Debbie opened the fridge and put the pot of red stuff down on the counter.

She looked as disappointed as Mark felt inside.

“But that wouldn’t be fair,” she said.

“We’re in this together now. We’re a team.”

He wanted to say something – but didn’t.

“Ok,” he said.

“We’re in this together.”

Smiling, he left the room and dropped his messenger bag by the end of the couch before slumping down on the couch.

“Oh well.”

Shane Warne Floats The Idea Of Bringing Back His Old Talkshow At FOX Exec Meeting

TEXT:

A whole boardroom nervously laughed this morning at FOX Sport’s Sydney headquarters today after recent big-name signing Shane Warne floated the idea of maybe bringing back his old talkshow.

During the 2010-11 Ashes Series, Shane had his own cricket-themed variety show that debuted to great fanfare – but was ultimately killed off by ‘uppity middle-managers with an axe to grind’ – according to the retired wrist spinner.

“I think it’s got legs,” said Shane.

“Just look at Matty Johns. He had his own show, Sterlo has his own show. They’re both great. You should give one to my old friend Sam Newman, too. He’s a bit of a unit but he’d rate.”

The team of executives smiled back at Shane.

“So,” he said.

“Is that a yes or what?”

Everyone, including Shane, turned to Rex Waterford.

At the best of times, Rex says the right thing, according to those who know him best.

As the group creative president at Murdoch’s sports wing, it is him who’d ultimately greenlight or yellowlight the project.

“We’ll see after June 30, Shane,” he said.

“You’ve already cost us a bomb, we need to get a bit of value out of you first before we start talking silly buggers.”

A pause.

Shane laughed, then the whole room erupted shortly afterwards.

“Righto, Rex. We’ll talk later.”

Michaelia Cash Grabs Letter Opener As Person Serving Subpoena Knocks On Door

TEXT:

Embattled Liberal Senator Michaelia Cash reportedly snatched an idle letter opener off her desk and hidden under the table as a man attempting to service a Federal Court subpoena knock on her office door.

Earlier today, the Federal Court has issued a subpoena that forced Jobs Minister to give evidence in the Australian Workers Union (AWU) raids case.

However, the prominent West Australian has since made it clear that she does not want to do that.

Speaking to The Advocate via wired telephone as she sat crammed under her Tasmanian cedar desk in Parliament House, Cash said she’s since instructed her lawyers to fix the problem.

“I can hear the prick, he’s right outside my door,” she whispered.

“My lawyers are on the way here to try and stop him. I’ve got my letter opener in case he feels the need to kick the door down. I can’t believe my staff just let him in foyer like that,”

“Please help. If he serves those papers to me, I’m fucked! And not just me, Malcolm would be fucked as well. Come to think of it, that silver-tongued kayaking lunatic has a law degree. I’ll give him a ring.”

Cash slammed the phone down and started to dial the Prime Minister’s number when she heard a loud crack come from the door.

“Fuck,” she said softly.

“Somebody’s fucking let him in here!”

She peered up from behind her desk and saw Malcolm slip through the door smiling.

He guestered to her, saying get up off the floor and to sit down in her chair.

“I don’t think there’s any way around this,” said Malcolm.

“Who are you using for legal council? I know a few old friends down here who can hel..”

Malcolm pasued as he saw Michaelia pull the letter opener out of her pocket and stab it down on the table.

“Shine,” she said.

“I’m with fucking Shine Lawyers! We’re fucked!”

Malcolm nodded in agreement, picked up her phone and rang the leader of the Opposition.

“Hello Bill,” he said.

“Can you do me another pair? Yes. Yes, my Jobs Minister is about to go on extended leave until this whole thing with your boss blows over, yeah?”

Local Shearing Team Breaks Even After Payments Made To Shed’s Swear Jar

TEXT:

Sometimes swearing up to twice per sheep, a local shearing team has told reporters that they’ve barely broken even this week after a landowner put a swear jar in his shed.

Dennis Procter, who is a man of God, said he made the contractor aware of the jar’s presence before they started work on his flock last Thursday.

But that’s now been disputed by the team’s old hand, Simon Sherlock, who said he was ‘basically held to ransom’ over the swear jar payment upon completing the job.

“Dennis was classing the wool as it came off, so he was obviously in earshot of it all,” said Sherlock.

“I actually did notice him taking down a tally of some sort, I wasn’t sure what but you know, I had more pressing things to worry about – such as swinging off the press most of the day,”

“Long story short, this jibbering old cunt has locked the gate on us just then pulled our keys from our ignitions before we left and said we owed him for the swear jar. I thought he was taking the piss! A fucking swear jar in a shearing shed? What will they think of next? A tip jar in the sperm bank? Fuck me roan!”

Both parties confirmed that after a short negotiation prior to what could’ve been a seriously physical confrontation, Sherlock agreed to pay back almost all the profit made from the job in return for Proctor returning their property.

Now the matter is before the Fairwork Tribunal, who will decide whether it’s legal.

Mr Proctor declined to be interviewed by The Advocate as Clancy Overell, our paper’s editor, has a history with him that’s not good history.

In March 1998, it was alleged by Proctor that Mr Overell introduced his daughter to pot and in turn, away for our Lord Saviour Jesus Christ.

Ruth Proctor now does the meat tray at four North Betoota hotels and organises the Tractor Pull at the town’s small farm field days.

Holidaying Tax Accountant Gets A Bit Ahead Of Himself With GoPro Purchase

TEXT:

Though he doesn’t plan on doing anything too extreme on his upcoming holiday, a popular local tax accountant as purchased himself a GoPro to document his European odyssey with.

Speaking candidly to The Advocate in the lunch line at the Subway on the ground floor of our building, Colin Cresney said he liked the size and image quality of the camera – and that it made him look like a real adventurer.

“Which couldn’t be further from the truth!” he laughed.

“I’ve still got bad grommets in my ears which prevents me from even swimming. Despite that, I even let the smooth-talking young man at Harvey Norman talk me into buying a waterproof case! Anyway, I’m going to Italy, France and Spain for three weeks,”

“Doing the usual things. Eating, drinking wine, you know? I might even get some hoota. But yeah, I certainly won’t be throwing myself off any bridges or anything! I won’t be skiing with it, either. Don’t want to Schumacher my noggin!”

Paying with a fist full of coins, Colin joined our reporter in the food court to continue their chat.

However, much to the dismay of the other patrons in the food court, Colin unwrapped a footlong seafood sensation on white bread, complete with a double helping of melted English cheese.

“Jesus mate,” said one man from across the room.

“Can you take that shit outside? The fuck is wrong with you, cunt?”

Colin looked back at our reporter, who was already halfway out the room – dry heaving.

Confused Cyclists Finds Themselves Riding Down Local Footpath

TEXT:

A pair of cyclists were seen riding down a narrow footpath this morning in the Old City District, prompting questions as to why they were doing it.

Denise Pearlman and Roger Pooley, two self-described-middle-aged yuppies from the French Quarter, rang their bells incessantly at the shuffling pedestrians that blocked their path.

“On your right,” yelled Roger as he rolled his eyes at a man caught aware of his presence on the footpath.

“Are your ears painted on? Ring ring means get out of my way!”

The man being rung by the semi-retired software consultant was Colin Partridge, who smiled and pretended like the interaction didn’t bother him.

However, upon speaking to The Advocate, Colin said he was burning inside with a rage that can only fester early on a Tuesday morning.

“I live in hope that he’s an organ donor,” said Colin.

“Is he lost? Why is he on the footpath? Aren’t they supposed to be on the road? You should’ve seen the scowl he gave me as he rode past. The hide on that bastard!”

Aside from Roger’s obvious frustrations with riding on the footpath, the domain of the pedestrian, Denise said her morning ride is often ruined by people walking to work down Jones Avenue.

The recently-retrenched ABC radio producer said that it’s often too unsafe to ride on the road because there are cars on it.

Our reporter caught up with her at the next set of traffic lights.

“We can’t be expected to ride in traffic, it’s unsafe,” she said.

Suddenly, Colin pulled up between our reporter and Denise with yet another hostile look on him.

“How about you fuck off, mate? Leave us alone!” he said as his pink 60-year-old face pulsated with years pent-up self-righteousness.

“Go write another article about how cyclists are the bane of the motorist’s – and pedestrian’s existence!”

Denise attempted to calm Roger down but he wasn’t having a bar of it.

“And another thing, you Pius cunt!” he yelled.

Just as suddenly as he rolled up to the conversation, his eyes rolled back in his head for a second time – only now it was because an enormous piece of plaque had dislodged from the wall of his aorta and was now blocking it.

With the metallic thud that can only be made by a body and bike hitting the bitumen, Denise and our reporter quickly removed Roger’s helmet and began performing CPR.

Mr Pearlman was transported to Royal Betoota Base Hospital at approximately 9:20am this morning, where he is now listed as being in a critical but stable condition.

Blues Fan Entering Period Of Optimism Before State Of Origin

TEXT:

Local blues die-hard Josh Sullivan has already begun explaining to coworkers why New South Wales will win the State of Origin this year.

Work colleague Ash Barton said that Sullivan, 29, usually starts carrying on about Origin around this time of year, before reaching fever pitch the week of game Game One.

“I feel so bad for him, like he gets incredibly excited for it and it’s tough to watch the deflation mid-way through Game 2 or 3,” Barton said.

Sullivan said that he knows NSW haven’t had the best go of it lately but this year they are “genuine favourites.”

“If you look at the potential teams, player v player, we have a better team on paper,” Sullivan said.

“Easily. Easily better,” he then said to our reporters, as if he was trying to convince himself.

“Honestly, our forward pack is way better this year. We should bash them in the middle, and then let The Fox (Josh Ado-Carr) and Tommy Turbo (Tom Trbojevic) dot down on the edges,” he said.

“No Smith, No Thurston. A Billy Slater that needs to be put together with a drill and a screwdriver, it has to be our year.”

“It’s gonna be brilliant when we wipe the fucking smile of the Maroons faces. I can just see it now.”

Colleague Barton said Sullivan was pretty bad last year after the Game 2 loss.

“He was crushed, throwing around comments like; “How many boats did Cam Smith give the fckn ref this year,” and; “it’s just fucked. How can we win when it’s rigged?””

Sullivan confirmed that NSW has to win this year for his sanity.

“I can’t do it anymore, I spend months getting wound up, and in a flash it’s all over and I am saying to myself, ah well always next year. I have spent my entire 20’s doing that mate. I don’t know where my life’s gone.”

“When Darren Lockyer retires, when Jonathan Thurston retires, when Smith retires, fuck me dead, I’m over these whens. I really need the boys to step up this year, and I’m telling you they will.”

Queensland Man Arrested For Allegedly Using His Outside Voice While Inside A Sydney Pub Overnight

TEXT:

A Brisbane man is due to face court this morning after being detained by police overnight for allegedly enjoying himself in Sydney overnight.

John Darcy Cartwright, of Betoota Hills, was observed by police from the harbour capital’s Riot and Public Order Squad shouting at friends inside a pub at around 1 am last night.

Police will allege that the 24-year-old came over to his mates, who were all watching another mate break the pub’s Buck Hunter record, and yell at them.

Speaking with The Advocate this morning via telephone, a media liaison with the Surry Hills Police LAC said that behaviour such as that showcased by Mr Cartwright in ‘unacceptable’ and ‘antisocial’.

“We received a complaint from a nearby resident that somebody was inside a pub shouting at the top of their lungs,” said the spokesperson.

“Officers from the Surry Hills LAC attended the scene were they discovered Mr Cartwright using his outside voice inside – which carries a penalty of up to seven years in prison and fines of up to fifty Hail Marys,”

“He’s due to appear in court this afternoon and the Crown will oppose bail as we feel he’s a flight risk. That is all for now.”

Our reporter also spoke to some of John’s friends who were with him at the time of the arrest.

One mate, who asked to remain anonymous, said that while John was ‘feeling happy’ and ‘enjoying his time in Sydney’, he wasn’t aware that doing such things attracts such a heavy penalty.

“I’ll go back to the start,” they said.

“So Stevo was only two bucks away from getting the high school on the Buck Hunter they had there. So anyway, we’re all shouting and carrying on then John’s like, ‘Who wants another fucking beer?’ and we all just shouted and hollered. We were so pumped for Stevo,”

“Anyway, this bloke comes in from outside and tells us to be quite as he’s got a 50-month-old next door who we’ve just woken up. John told him to go and get fucked and that if he came into the pub with that type of bullshit again, he’d wrap a pool cue around his head. This yuppie cunt has spooked at that and obviously called the coppers. Now were in this mess,”

“Look, I’ve probably said too much. We just want to go home.”

Uncle’s ‘Controversial Opinion’ Surprisingly Mild

TEXT:

A Henderson family get-together has finished on an unorthodox pleasant note today, which pundits are attributing to uncle Brian Henderson’s ‘controversial opinion’ being surprisingly mild for a change.

During his brother Marcus Henderson’s 51st birthday cake and tea celebration, Brian Henderson waited for the usual post cake lull to settle before unleashing one of his signature controversial opinions, to the chagrin of his sister in law, niece, nephew and nephew’s boyfriend.

Today, however, this was not the case, as Henderson’s ‘controversial opinion’ seemed uncharacteristically respectful and considerate.

“Controversial opinion, but I think that if someone wants to die they should be given the choice to do so. Our government needs to look into assisted dying options,” stated Henderson through a mouthful of Woolworth’s bee sting cake.

Other members of the Henderson family were speechless, as their uncle’s usually head trauma inducing opinion appeared to be formed from genuine empathy and understanding.

His niece Gemma Henderson (26) was particularly shocked by this and is at a loss as to why her uncle is acting like this.

“Has he been reading news from a website that doesn’t have a crosshair in the logo?” Gemma Henderson wondered as her uncle went on to explain the correlation between countries with assisted dying laws and their overall livability.

“On my birthday I chucked a slice of lemon meringue cheesecake at him because he wouldn’t shut up about how men should have equal say about the rights of a fetus. Since when did he approach issues with actual compassion?”

Henderson’s nephew Collin Henderson (24) says there is a more sinister reason that his uncle is keeping his controversial opinions more approachable than before.

“He’s being nice because he doesn’t want us to bring up the fact that his Parramatta Eels are playing like absolute shit,” Collin Henderson stated with confidence.

“Either that or he’s giving Nana a not-so-subtle hint.”

Overly Polite Man Unable To Leave Negative Review Of Pizza Man That Ruined Dinner

TEXT:

Despite ruining his dinner last night, a very polite young man wasn’t able to leave a negative review out of fear it might cost the young backpacker who delivered the pizza his job.

Daniel Coleman told The Advocate today that he was very disappointed when he opened the pizza box last night to find most of it was attached to the lid.

“How fucking hard is it?” he asked our reporter.

“People talk about the gig economy and about how these delivery drivers don’t get fuck all, like less than minimum wage. Well, forgive me for sounding like my Liberal-voting father but if you can’t successfully deliver a pizza, you don’t deserve the minimum wage,”

“Actually. I’m sorry. That’s a bit much. They do deserve the minimum wage but you sure as shit don’t deserve much more. Anyway, the bloke who delivered the pizza was a backpacker so I doubt he really cares if his employer contributes to his super. But he would care about keeping his job, so I didn’t want to leave a bad review in case he lost his job. This is Australia; nobody should lose their job for doing it half-arsed.”

The Advocate reached out to the company Mr Coleman used and received a prompt but scripted response.

GluttonPoon, a subsidiary of StiffAorta Pty Ltd, released a statement this afternoon which absolved them of any wrongdoing whatsoever.

“We encourage users to rate their experience accordingly,” the statement read.

“So we can assure our shareholders that maximum returns are being met. Should a customer have a negative experience using GluttonPoon, we will find the delivery rider responsible and terminate their employment after a savage but necessary beating,”

“Our generous donations to both political major parties ensures that business will prosper into the future, for our shareholders.”

Nice Part Of Town Puts Fairy Lights In Trees

Far from the rampant carjackings and random stabbings of the South Ponds district, a Betoota Grove Municipal Council motion has seen fairy lights installed in the trees of the suburb’s boutique shopping street.

Councillor Gwendolyn-Jane Mathieson-Smith, who still enjoys a level of wealth which was built by the byproducts of colonisation,  introduced the motion after seeing similar things done in other nice parts of other towns.

The marginally-employed-mother-of-a-Reds-player spoke exclusively to The Advocate about having her dream to bring a little bit of Brisbane’s leafy Paddington district to the central South-West come to life.

“It’s fantastic,” Mrs Mathiseon-Smith said to our reporter as she walked him up and down Adelaide Avenue.

“You should come back at night time to really take it all in. This has been about a year in the making, we’ve had to order the lights in from Europe via China. The council also had a lighting engineer fly up from Brisbane to make sure it all looked the part,”

“The feedback we’ve had from the people here in Betoota Grove has been fantastic. I love living here.”

Volcanologists Pierce Brosnan And Tommy Lee Jones Reunite For Hawaiian Volcano Epic

TEXT:

Two prominent silver screen volcanologists are set to combine their knowledge and latent sexual energy in an X-rated reboot of 1997’s geological thrillers Dante’s Peak and Volcano which has the working title, Dante’s Volcano.

Pierce Brosnan and Tommy Lee Jones have reportedly signed with Disney to bring their beloved old character’s back to life in what’s been described as being the summer blockbuster of 2019.

Set on the Hawaiian island of Maui, both Brosnan and Jones will at first be pitted against each other before begrudgingly having to work together to save all of mankind for a volcanic winter.

Speaking to The Advocate this afternoon via Skype, Brosnan said he was apprehension about the project but once the studio promised him an X rating, he was in.

“I don’t know what they have in mind to make it rated X,” he said.

“As a matter of fact, I’m quite intrigued. I thought you could only get an X rating if you showed people actually fucking on screen, like something full-on pornographic in nature. Even then, I thought they had to be raw-dogging it to finally get that X,”

“If that’s what they have in mind, then it’ll certainly be a new experience for me. There was nothing in the script to suggest that but Ron Howard has done madder things. I’m looking forward to production starting as soon as they put the volcano out.”

Critically and commercially acclaimed director Ron Howard is attached to direct the 330-minute epic film after talks with Mel Gibson fell through earlier this year.

Howard spoke to our reporter shortly after Pierce handed his MacBook over him.

“The X rating comes from a scene were we needlessly show people being thrown into molten lava,” confirmed Howard.

“The rumors surrounding the possible appearance of some drunken reverse cowgirl or lazy Sunday morning side doggy are false. The X rating comes entirely from violent death and gore. Just the way it ought to be.”

The Advocate reached out to Mr Jones’ management for comment but he was still asleep at the time of print.

Dante’s Volcano is set to premiere in Australia on the 30th of January next year.

Coastie Named ‘Kade’ Smashes Stereotypes By Not Knowing How To Fight

TEXT:

A Maroochydore man who now calls Betoota Hills home has confided in friends, who then immediately told The Advocate, that he doesn’t know how to throw hands – despite being from a coastal town.

Kade Brooks, a second-year sports science student at South Betoota Polytechnic College, said that many people expected him to be able to fight because of his appearance and pedigree.

“I’ve had lots of guys look me up and down and walk away,” he said.

“When we go out on those college theme nights and stuff, you know the nights when all the townies come out and try to mingle with the students, they always leave me alone for some reason,”

“Then somebody said it was because I’m a coastie named Kade with a sleeve tattoo – so they just assumed I knew how to fuck people up at the drop of a hat. The truth is far from that.”

The 24-year-old fears for the day when somebody decides to take a shot at the title and throw down at him.

“My parents always told me not the fight people. You can kill people with one punch. It’s largely redundant and you can get arrested for it. The best thing to do is walk away and get punched in the back of the head. I’m worried that someone who can actually fight, like a Golden Glovesman or something, will come find me then boot my colon out through my mouth!”

Our reporter reached out to some of Kade’s college friends for comment.

One mate, Billy Campbell, said that being seen near Kade on nights out has both given him the confidence to be a bit lippy to strangers as well as the feeling one gets when they feel untouchable.

“It’s great,” he said.

“But I know what you mean, if somebody goes nuclear on us, you might as well warm the helicopter up because we’ll be in big trouble,”

“But until that day, I will call you a fuck head from a moving car and there’s nothing you can do to stop me.”

Aside from choosing the crudest and arguably least politically correct card for his brother’s upcoming birthday, Brett Gregson also felt compelled to leave a few choice insults inside in his own childlike scrawl.

William Gregson is turning 29 and he feels bad about it.

“After work, I got off the bus a stop early up at the shops and strolled through the newsagency for like twenty minutes. I had to look right up the back for the more racy ones. Here,”

Brett pulled out his phone and showed our reporter a picture of the card he chose while he struggled to contain his laughter.

It is not fit to print.

“Fucking pissa, hey?” he said.

“Anyway, poor Bill is getting old. Most of his mates are getting married and having kids now. All that old Bill’s managed to put together in his nigh-on triple decade on this hellish fuckhole we call Earth, is a huge credit card debt and a career in public service! What a fucking spoon. Love him but, don’t talk shit about him in the newspaper.”

The Advocate reached out to William for comment but he said he would rather spend his upcoming birthday in bed listening to Radiohead.

Our reporter phoned him a short time ago.

“I’m not ready to be 29,” he wrote.

“Please don’t make a big deal out of it. My birthday is on Friday and I don’t want anybody to make a big deal, I’ve already changed my birthday to February so nobody writes on my Facebook wall. I hate my birthday,”

“But Bretto always gets me a funny card, if that’s what you’re calling about.”

Mum And Aunt Joan’s Royal Wedding Bender Finally Ends

TEXT:

Life has been a blur for two local women ever since Harry and Megan said I do.

Mother-of-two Maggie Pearson and her sister Joan Rutherford have been three sheets to the wind for three days.

Both of them have little to no idea what day it is; Joan’s erratic public behaviour has attracted the attention of the neighbours more than once.

However, after their dealer stopped replying to their messages and Maggie’s husband came around for the third time to plead with her to come home, the bender has mercifully ended.

Joan bid farewell to her sister from the couch as she lay there motionlessly, ashing nonchalantly in a half-eaten Pad Thai.

“It’s been real,” she said.

“I think this party would’ve killed Ben Cousins. Are we really out of piss? Jesus wept! Hey! Maggie, come here! Give me a hug!”

Maggie hugged her sister and gave her the rest of her cigarettes, saying her husband won’t let her smoke anymore – shooting him a filthy look as he stood in the doorway twirling car keys.

Joan smiled in gratitude moments before her eyes rolled back in her head and she was off to sleep land.

Opening the door for his wife, Jack Pearson told our reporter that he hadn’t seen his wife in such a state of disrepair since William’s wedding.

Speaking to The Advocate on the front lawn of Joan’s house, Mr Pearson said he enjoyed the peace and quiet at home over the weekend but at her age, staying up for three full days on cheap drugs and white wine probably shaved a year off her life.

“I can’t talk,” he said.

“When the Cowboys won the premiership, the wife and kids didn’t see me for nearly a calendar month. No regrets, though,”

“Well, you know what they say. Marriage is all about compromise. Royal Weddings are like grand finals, I guess.”

Man Apologises In Advance Before Introducing New Girlfriend To Family

TEXT:

Starting out as a string of late-night weekend rendezvous with regular healing weekday silence, a relationship between two city workers turned into something mildly more significant last Sunday as one of them met the family for the first time.

However, just as they pulled into the driveway of a leafy Betoota Grove home, mere seconds away from the brunch table, Rob Starling turned to Sacha Connor and apologised for everything that he thought was about to happen.

“Uncle Jeff might make a racist joke or he might just sit there and stare at you. I know you’d probably want to pull him up on it but it’d be easier if you didn’t. You can do it at Christmas, just not today. It’d be a good excuse to leave early, actually,” he said.

“But yeah. Look, I’m sorry for what you’re about to walk into.”

Sacha and Rob spoke to The Advocate today over a French Quarter sushi train lunch about what happened next.

“I just said it was OK a million times and said nothing could really shock me,” said Sacha.

“What did he want me to say? ‘Oh, actually, let’s just turn around and go home and pretend today never happened,’ or something like that?”

“But I can see why he felt like he had to apologise in advance. Yeah, in retrospect I understand his concerns.”

As predicted, Uncle Jeff made a crude joke and let his eyes burn holes in the back of Sacha’s head all afternoon.

Rob’s mother chose an especially hostile line of questioning that crept as close to the line as one could tolerate.

His father just looked at the barbecue and thought about what the cricket and toyed with the idea of getting Austar this summer for the cricket.

Rob’s sister, Gwen, was semi-conscious on the couch with a wet washer over her face and a bucket by her side.

“If somebody tries to sell you a bag for $200 in a club. Don’t buy it, it’s probably not what you think it is,” she said, coughing as she shook Sacha’s hand for the first time.

Looking over at Rob, he shrugged and gave a double thumbs up.

As the sun disappeared behind the Colorbond at the end of the yard, Rob said he had to go because he had some work to finish up before Monday.

Dad shook his hand and went back to cleaning the barbecue. Mum hugged Sacha with a mild disapproval and Gwen was now unconscious.

“Well, that went well,” said Rob getting back in the car.

18-Year-Old Orders A Chicken Pad Kee Mao Like A God Damn Grown Up

TEXT:

A local 18-year-old temp worker has today taken full advantage of the money she earns as an employee, by purchasing an exotic Thai meal on her half hour lunch break.

Tessa Cooper is just a couple months in to her working gap year, where she plans to save up enough money to travel the world for three months at the end of the year.

Needless to say, she’s pretty grown up now, and it shows with her la de da lunch order.

“Yeah just a chicken pad thai thanks” she orders, before realising she’s just saying what most young Australians are programmed to say at the counter of a Thai take-away restuarant.

“Actually” she says.

“Make that a chicken pad kee mao”

Oooooooh. Not many of her friends would know that she orders off-menu Thai meals during her lunch break, except for Jessie, who was with Tessa the other day, when she ordered a tofu Pad See Ew.

Everyone in the restaurant takes notice and gives Tessa that nod to say “you know real Thai food”.

“Chilli?” asks the man at the cashier.

“No chilli” says Tessa, before handing over $12 dollars in coins, like a grown up.

Man Who Had Cereal For Tea Labels MasterChef Contestant ‘Pathetic’ After Profiteroles Fail To Rise

TEXT:

A remarkably unpopular South Betoota man labelled a MasterChef contestant ‘pathetic’ moments after her profiteroles failed to rise before the judges – just hours after he had cereal for dinner.

Nathan Dacleary, of Alison Road in Betoota Hills, told our reporters that he couldn’t help but laugh as Maria Culver’s dessert fizzled in front of the two manlets and food critic Matt Preston.

He spoke to The Advocate a short time ago about his sentiments toward the show.

“Pathetic,” he uttered to himself.

“Profiteroles aren’t even difficult. Bottom three for you.”

However, his couch and life partner spoke candidly to our reporter regarding Nathan’s criticisms of Ms Culver.

Cameron Wilmott said she’s often taken aback by the things Nathan yells at the television but this time, it seems his criticisms are unfounded.

“He had generic-brand sultana bran for dinner,” she said.

“And it’s not like he just felt like something easy. I’ve lived with him for five years and he hasn’t so much as cooked a toad in the hole since then. If there’s anyone less qualified to put shit on a person trying to cook a fancy dessert, it’s this bag of human shit I share a couch with,”

Our reporter nervously laughed then put the phone down softly.

Ambulances To Be Fitted With Blokes In TapOut T-Shirts To Combat Assaults On Paramedics

TEXT:

The shocking rates of assaults on emergency staff in Australia has today resulted in state government action in both Victorian and New South Wales.

Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews has today announced that from next month, paramedics will be equipped with dodgy blokes named Caleb, complete with shitty tatts and a chesty TapOut t-shirt.

“This is imperative to helping our paramedics help us. It is never okay to assault a paramedic”

The decade-long trend of attacks on officers, which has risen significantly, with the prevalence of drugs, alcohol and family violence – has left Australia’s already exhausted emergency staff at serious risk of verbal and physical assault.

Data provided by NSW Ambulance shows six out of every 10 incidents of assault and abuse experienced by paramedics involved suspected alcohol or drug use. This has also forced the hand of NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian.

“Following the trend started by Victorian to prevent attacks on our valued emergency staff, we too will be sending dodgy half-pissed roid boys on the road with our paramedics to combat assaults”

“Only our anti-assault staff will be named Kane, and they’ll be made up of citizens that are completing community service for drink driving and public nuisance”

“These young men will be given the duty of towelling up anyone showing signs of assaulting our valued paramedics”

While assaults on paramedics are, comparatively, much lower in the state of Queensland, Premier Palaszczuk has already announced plans to send members of the Broncos U19s for ambulance ride-alongs, in a similarly-styled program.

Account Managers Gather Near Water Cooler To Plot How They’ll Ruin New Creative Brief

TEXT:

The greatest trick account managers ever pull is convincing the industry that they need to exist.

That’s the opinion of four middle managers at the Old City District’s hottest new agency, Rusty Trombone, who told our reporters this morning that they’ve just received a new creative brief from a faceless transglobal corporation that’s looking to expand into the growing Asia-Pacific market.

Though it currently sounds promising and fun, the account managers are looking to change that.

In an effort to remove all tangle humour, innovation and creativity from this latest brief, the account managers gathered around the office water cooler to plot its downfall.

“We got a great pitch back from the creative team but I don’t get it, so it’s not good,” said Dorothy Pearlman, a 30-year veteran of the industry.

“There were some parts which I thought were funny but yeah, on the whole, I think I need to make some changes to really suck the life out of it.”

Echoing Dorothy’s sentiments was Brett Gresham, the agency’s lead account director executive coordinator.

“I agree. I think it’s a bit too homogenous and it could be more clever. I don’t think the client would appreciate it, so I think I’ll leave it on my desk for a few days and see if anything comes to mind as to make it a bit better,” he said.

“Don’t get me wrong, I like the concept. I don’t think its Cannes-quality. This business is built on the back of how many Lions you have in reception so you can see where I’m coming from.”

The Advocate reached out to the creative team at Rusty Trombone for comment but none were willing to go on record against their Tarocash overlords.

Blame Game Begins As Local Sharehouse Misses Bin Night For Another Week

TEXT:

The residents of Lower Holland Street in Betoota Hills were woken this morning by a very loud and public F-bomb as one sharehouse patriarch realised the bins didn’t go out – again.

Damien Crozier, a French Quarter bartender, was said to be livid with his two other housemates, Julia Cartwright and Molly Sharbel, after he trusted one of them to make sure the bins went out as he was going to be working all night.

When he got home early this morning, he saw a ream of empty discarded bins down his street with his two still sitting proudly up the side of the house.

For the second week in a row.

“I got home around 7am after a pretty long night having Amex cards thrown at me by bankers,” said Crozier.

“Every part of me was sticky and all I wanted to do was rip a two quick billies, get in the shower, have two slices of cold pizza then go to sleep,”

“But all I could do was get out of the Falcon, slam the door shut and shout ‘Fuck!’ as loud as my little lungs would let me. Honestly, why me? We had three kilos of stolen prawns for dinner on Thursday night and the pong coming from the bins is in violation of the Geneva Convention! Fuck!”

Aside for the four young families that live directly next to the prominent, infamous sharehouse, Julia and Molly were also woken up by Damien’s screams.

“I thought he stepped on the sprinkler or something,” said Molly.

“Then I realised it was bin day and Julia came home with a fair steam on her. I kinda just hoped she put the bins out. I was already in bed when she got home, it’s not my fault.”

However, Julia seems to think she’s blameless.

“How was I supposed to remember after being at the yacht club all afternoon, I don’t even remember how I got home? If anyone is to blame, it’s Damien. He should’ve put the bins out before he went to work. Fucking chinstrap fuckhead,”

“He’s trying to blame us both for this when I think he’s only trying to make up for his own mistakes! Fuck it, I’m moving out!”

Local Mum-Of-Six Treats Herself To Breakfast Over The Sink

TEXT:

Mother of six Jacinta Hunt (32) has gifted herself a taste of la dolce vita this morning by treating herself to a cup of tea and a slice of toast over the sink.

At 7:15 am, Hunt was startled to discover she had awoken from her own volition and not to the sound of one of her six children crying or fighting over whose turn it was to pick the morning TV shows.

“At first I thought I was dreaming. The house was completely quiet,” stated Hunt as she fought back tears.

Unable to get back to sleep due to the sound of her husband Joseph’s snoring, Hunt silently made her way to the kitchen where she made herself a cup of tea and a slice of peanut butter toast.

“I even spread some butter on the toast before I put the peanut butter on. It was like a holiday. In fact it was better than a holiday because I didn’t have the kids nagging me to buy them shit from a crappy souvenir shop.”

Hunt then went on to consume her toast over the sink as not to dirty any plates and save herself washing up later on.

“I would have used a plate if I wasn’t the only one who ever did any washing up around here. Eating over the sink is easier, plus the table is fucking filthy because Lucas hasn’t cleaned up his paper mache.”

Unfortunately for Hunt, just moments after she finished her glorious tea and toast, fifth child Rose (6) came into the kitchen and started to cry when she was told they were out of Milo.

This outburst caused a chain reaction in which the remaining members of the family emerged from bed and viciously fought each other over the last bowl of Crunchy Nut Cornflakes.

“Guess I’ve got to take the boys to footy now…At least I’ll always have this morning.”

Foxtel Exec Can’t Understand Why Millennials Aren’t Paying For A Service They Can Just Steal

TEXT:

As pay-TV subscriptions continue to decline, Foxtel executive Greg Holmes (62) has been tasked with determining why people are no longer paying for something they can steal for free.

Despite the Newscorp subsidiary making innovative strides such as switching back to satellite dishes and hiring Warnie to commentate, the network is unsure why they are failing to attract subscribers by airing television programs avid viewers can illegally download with no cost to them.

“We will always have an audience of people who want to pay $150 a month to watch shows about pawn shops,” states Yoon.

“It’s just the other 99% of Australians we need to convince that Foxtel is a service that provides value for money.”

Popular TV and Movie streaming websites such as Netflix and Stan are largely attributed to being responsible for the decline in pay-TV subscribers but Yoon says her network has a plan to get punters back on board.

“We’re looking at doing a Real Housewives of Brisbane.”

“If that doesn’t work I can’t think of anything that might apart from increasing the range of quality content at a suitable speed with a more affordable price tag.”

Christian Hen’s Night Kicks Up A Notch As Kimberly Gets A Spare

TEXT:

There was a time when Peta Washbrook regretted walking into the Betoota Heights Hillsong Church – but those days are long, long gone.

The 19-year-old said she didn’t know what she wanted from life before she found Jesus.

Now she just wants to be happy.

And that happiness now knows no bounds after a fellow churchgoer dropped a knee just 44 days into their budding post-summer relationship.

“It really took me by surprise,” said Peta.

“This time last year, I was pulling cones bigger than the boys were at recess. You could rarely find me without my favourite Paul Newman salad dressing bong. I thought I was happy. We’d go out and underage drink in parks. Throw rocks at the police and leave things on the road for people to run over like cans, rocks and bottles,”

“It was a simpler time.”

Peta recounted her misspent youth for our reporter last night at the Old City District Bowlorama, where she and some other church friends celebrated her last few weeks as a single woman.

“Kimberly said they do an ice cream cake here that’s so good, it’ll make you speak in tongues,” said Peta.

But the conversation was interrupted by Kimberly getting a spare.

With a great shriek, young Kim spun around in her bowling shoes and let the sheer ecstasy of the moment wash over her like she’d been dumped by a four-foot shorey outside the flags.

“Fuck yeah!” yelled Kim.

Peta laughed and jumped up and down as Kim ran up for a hug.

From the side, Peta’s non-Christian sister Brenda suggested they get a bag.

They all looked puzzled but Peta nodded in quiet agreement – then the celebrations continued.

One Night Stand’s Dog Looks Up At Local Man With A Vacant Look Of Disgust

TEXT:

With his ponytail flapping playfully in the warm desert breeze last night, a mildly unpopular accountant threw caution to the wind and followed his friends from one suburban pub to a famous inner Betoota nitespot.

Admitting to our reporter this morning on the D45 bus from the French Quarter up the hill to Betoota Heights, Boris Watson said he was kind of glad he did follow his mates to the Fitzrovia Club on Ru de Putain last night because he ended up going home with a perfect stranger.

“It was kind of weird,” said the directionless 32-year-old.

“Come to think of it, it was pretty fucking weird. I told myself I wasn’t going to get pissed last night. I even took my work shit to the pub so I’d have a reason to leave. But yeah, it was stinking hot yesterday out in that beer garden and long story short, I reckon I must’ve inhaled five schooners of heavy in the hour on an empty stomach. The only smart thing I did was put my work gear behind the bar,”

“Then yeah, it’s all a bit of a blur until we got down the Fitz. We had some shots then me and another mate decided to cut the rug for a bit downstairs in that part, you know, just as you walk in?”

Judging from the reactions he received from other bus passengers telling the following part of the yarn, the rest of the story has been omitted from today’s edition of The Advocate.

Never the less, around 6am this morning, he left the home of an Old City District leasing agent, had a drink of water from her sharehouse kitchen sink and ran into the dog.

“He just kind of looked up at me, stared right into my eyes,” said Watson.

“I wondered if he was hungry or something but he wouldn’t let me near. He wouldn’t even take a pat. He just looked at me with this knowing but ultimately disgusted look. It was quite confronting, this hasn’t happened to me before. I said goodbye to him and walked out the door,”

“When I said it was a weird night, that’s what I mean. I mean the dog.”

Tesla Owner Admits He Misses The Dank Aroma Of Petrol While Filling The Car Up

TEXT:

A local tech start-up co-founder used to think he had everything in life – until he bought a Tesla.

Gone were the days Mark O’Regan needed to steer his car down the Diamantina Developmental Road to Windorah – he now has a car that does that laborious task for him.

He told The Advocate that there’s not much he’d change about his life right and there’s not much he misses from his old one.

But there is one thing.

The 44-year-old spoke candidly to our reporter earlier this afternoon about how he misses the smell of petrol. He misses having its sickly, addictive aroma surround him while he filled up his old, conventionally-powered automobile.

He picked our reporter up outside The Advocate‘s offices and went around the block a few times.

“It was a twin-turbo V8 AMG Mercedes so I was at the petrol bowser a fair bit,” he laughed.

“One thing about owning a Tesla is that you don’t need petrol. You need a whole heap of coal to charge these things up overnight. My garage still smells a bit fossil-fuelly but it’s just not the same,”

“I know the smell of petrol isn’t for everyone but it really got me going. There’s something about it that I love but hate at the same time,”

He then sighed and looked out the window.

“But I guess this car is pretty cool.”

Recovering Gambling Addict Longs For Day He Can Watch Live Sport In Peace

TEXT:

There was a time when Dennis Pooley could watch live sport at home, but after losing his home through a gambling addiction, nowadays he simply cannot bring himself to do it.

The 28-year-old told The Advocate that he had every reason to be happy in life – he had a stable job at South Betoota Polytechnic College, a wife born under the star of Aires and two kids that seemed like they might actually be halfway bright.

But what started out as just a small hobby, snowballed into an avalanche of debt and shame.

Speaking to our reporter this afternoon at a famous hi-vis eatery down the road from his brother’s 3 bedroom Betoota Hills California bungalow, Dennis admits that he made some mistakes.

“It was just so easy to gamble,” he sighed.

“You could do it from the comfort of your own home. You didn’t even need to jog down the pub and halftime to put your bets on. And when you lost, there was no public shaming process. Like when you load up on a ‘sure thing’ with the fellas down the pub and when it runs last, they all put shit on you and it’s a bit of a laugh,”

“This was far worse. One thing led to another and I basically had debts I couldn’t pay. We lost the house and the missus moved back to folk’s place in Yaraka with the kids. I hit rock bottom.”

Which is where the downtrodden Gemini reached out for help.

He rang the G-line and started receiving counselling for his problems – and albeit slowly – started to get his life back on track.

All, he says, except for one thing.

“I can’t watch live sport anymore. The advertising for gambling apps and whatnot is just too triggering for me. It should be illegal. Honestly, it’s nigh on criminal how predatory it is,”

“The replays don’t often have much in the way of betting ads in them. As much as it pains me to say, I think if I ever want to watch live sport again, I’ll have to get Austar. But they don’t show much in the way of league, so I’m torn.”

“I live in the hope that one day that type of live betting on live sport will be outlawed so me – and the countless, faceless thousands of people – can watch sport again without being constantly bombarded.”

Triple J Launch Internal Investigation After Station Broadcast Country Song

TEXT:

Heads are set to roll at the national broadcaster next week as Triple J launches an investigation this morning into allegations that somebody on staff played a country music track yesterday.

(I Ain’t) As Good As I Once Was by US singer-songwriter Toby Keith was allegedly played at 7:34 pm last night during Good Night’s with Bridget Hustwaite and now the head honchos want answers.

“Country music has no place on Triple J at that time of night,” said acting music director, Tony Jones.

“Don’t get us wrong, we love all types of music here at the Jays but country music needs to be green-lit by the station director or myself beforehand. The song by Toby Keith that was allegedly played last night doesn’t align with Triple J’s values and we have launched an internal investigation into the incident,”

“It glories alcohol-fuelled violence, group sex and uses outdated and insensitive terms such as ‘redneck’ and ‘Texas smile’. All of which do not belong on Triple J. The investigation’s finding will be released shortly.”

Although nobody has admitted to the crime, one local Triple J listener said he almost had a car crash when the song came over the radio as he drove him from work last night.

Matt Dunston said he double took at the radio which caused him to dangerous swerve into oncoming traffic when he heard the warbling, strong vocals of Toby Keith come on directly after the latest Hockey Dad track.

“It definitely took me by surprise. I thought I’d bumped the radio onto 2WEB or something. Desert Rock FM even. But I shit you not, it was Triple J,” he told The Advocate.

“I thought maybe Tom Tilley was getting a bit excited for the Mudgee Races this weekend and slipped up after Hack, but it was well after he would’ve left. The Dragons and playing the Milk down there as well this weekend. Some of us are driving down for it, actually,”

“Anyway, it was a nice change. Yeehaw Bridget.”

Jim’s Group Capitalise On Growing Narcotics Trade With New Franchise Option

TEXT:

Popular franchise business Jim’s Group has created controversy today by announcing that they’re looking to capitalise on the recent growth in the domestic narcotics market by offering a new mezzanine-level franchise option.

Jim’s Bags, named after the small resealable bags made famous by drug dealers around the world, is the newest franchise offered by Jim’s Group – which is better known for it’s other offerings such as Jim’s Mowing and Jim’s Antennas.

For around $50 000, a prospective franchisee receives a secondhand Subaru, a stolen Glock 17 semi-automatic handgun, 20 grams of uncut Hong Kong-quality cocaine, 35 mobile phones and territory control over their local area.

One South Betoota man has told The Advocate that he’s interested in the new franchise and he spoke to our reporter about some of the apprehensions he has about a possible career move.

“I’m a primary school teacher now, which is great but I’ve always wanted to be my own boss,” said Brett Gourlay, 34.

“But at the same time, I don’t think I have it in me to actually put a gun in someone’s face. I mean, what if the cops catch me doing it? I’ll go to prison. And if someone tougher than me tries to muscle in on my territory? What am I supposed to do? Shoot them? I don’t think so,”

“But I do enjoy doing cocaine. I had it for the first time at my brother’s bucks party on the Gold Coast and I just could not stop talking for hours. One of the strippers was actually about to pay me to shut up and just sit there. So yeah, I’m torn. I haven’t spoken to the wife about it yet, though.”

The Advocate reached out to Jim’s Group for comment but only received a sternly-worded letter from their legal representatives asking us not to publish this article until they broke the news themselves.

As this news organisation is not in the business of pandering to commercial entities, we published it anyway – because the news never sleeps.

Man Charged With Torture After Leaving Empty Tim Tam Packet In Fridge

TEXT:

A Betoota Heights man has fronted court this morning after being charged with torture earlier this week.

Darryl Norman Carmichael (42) was found to be in possession of an empty Tim Tam tray which he sadistically left in his fridge for other family members to find.

His wife, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, made the gruesome discovery on Tuesday morning and immediately alerted the Betoota Heights Police Force.

After a short vehicle and foot pursuit through the Alice Road Reserve and up Mulbray Avenue, Mr Carmichael was arrested and taken to the police station for questioning.

Detectives from the Queensland Major Crimes Squad that flew across from Brisbane interrogated the mortgage broker, where he confessed to the crime after being questioned for close to an hour.

Carmichael appeared in Betoota Local Court this morning where he entered a guilty plea to the lesser charge of assault with a deadly weapon, grievous bodily harm and resisting arrest.

The accused told the court that he was under the impression that he was in possession of a ‘never-ending’ tray of Tim Tams – as the recent ad campaign suggests.

Detective Peter Cornwallace of the Major Crimes Squad spoke to the media outside court a short time ago.

“We are glad justice will be served,” he said.

“However, his early guilty plea has been taken into consideration by the court and the Department of Public Prosecutions,”

“But let it be known, this is a very serious offence. The first of it’s kind in the South West as far as we’re concerned. Should we feel the penalty not fit the crime, we will appeal the sentence to the Court of Appeal,”

“Deceiving a person with an empty Tim Tam tray is about as bad as it gets. In all my time I’ve spent on the force, this is by far one of the most disturbing cases I’ve ever dealt with.”

Carmichael will be sentenced on June 14.

Dutton Hires Dog The Bounty Hunter To Find Missing Cameroonian Athletes

TEXT:

It’s been four weeks since the Commonwealth Games closing ceremony and the visas of eight Cameroonian athletes are due to expire at midnight tonight.

“Times up,” said Immigration minister, Peter Dutton.

He called a press conference today to address the issue, which he hosted out in the middle of Carrara Stadium around 5pm.

“In just over nine hours time, their visas will expire and they will become fugitives. My department has put a price on each of their heads and employed the greatest bounty hunter of all time to find them,”

“DOG!”

Just as Dutton finished saying that name, fireworks shot into the sky around the entrance tunnel out to the middle.

Kickstart My Heart by Mötley Crüe blasted through the PA system as smoke billowed out from atop the tunnel.

A loud revving of a Harley Davidson Fatboy echoed around the stadium and mixed dirtily with the heavy metal.

Dog The Bounty Hunter emerged on the motorbike, clutching a Smith & Wesson Model 27 in one hand and a bottle of Jim Beam in the other – many of the journalists were scared.

He raced up to the press conference at full throttle, cast the bourbon to hell along the way then shot an ABC journalist in the chest just because he fucking could.

High-fiving Dutton as he walked up to the mic in front of the camera, Dog cleared his throat and put the gurgling, writhing taxpayer-funded reporter out of his misery with a single shot to the back of the head.

“All right, motherfuckers!” shouted Dog.

Peter wooed confidently.

“I’m here to find those athletes and bring them to justice, dawgs. It’s just my job and I’ve got nothing against them. Fuck, I’ve got friends from Cameroon, dawg. They’re a beautiful people,”

“But yo, they’re breaking laws. I just want to let the Cameroonians know that I’ve been there before, dawg, and that they should go back to their families. They’re illegal aliens, dawg. I’ll bring them to justice,”

“Beware of the Dog! Aroooooooooooooooooooooooo!”

And with that, he threw Dutton the .44 magnum, who promptly wiped the prints off it with his polyester tie, then got back on his Harley and disappeared in a cloud of grey dust.

Peter left shortly after, while the remaining journalists that didn’t scatter from the gunfire raced back to perform CPR on the ABC reporter still lying motionless in the middle of the stadium.

While most young mother’s spend the early stages of parenthood researching future childcare options, Avale’igh’s mother, Janeighce (17), has been exhausting herself trying to keep up with the random visits from vague high school acquaintances.

“Ohh myy Goooood” she’s so cute, say Janny’s former high school enemy, Annabelle. I can’t believe how much she looks like you”

“Oh my God! She’s smiling haha. She loves me! Pass her to me”

Janeighce’s boyfriend, apprentice boilermaker Jordyn, says while he thinks it’s positive that they can maintain a social life around young parenthood, it does worry him that Avale’igh is being treated like a new member of the social circle.

“She can’t even talk and they’ve got her an Instagram page going. She’s 3 months old”

“Someone was talking about taking her to Groove In The Moo. I had to pull the pin on that idea”

Closer to home, Janeighce’s 16-year-old sister Hayleigh says it’s quite frustrating to see all of these people that claim to be Ava’s godparent.

“Like, just go have your own kids” she says.

“They’re just in it for the Instagram photos. No one would actually be willing to help out with babysitting, or better yet, fulfil their oath to teach Ava about God”

Prominent Local Banker Confirms Claims His ‘Adlay’ Son Is A ‘Toy C**t’

TEXT:

A merchant banker has been forced to take time out of his hectic afternoon to address growing allegations that his youngest son, who chooses to live life as an ‘adlay’, is not hard at all and actually a ‘toy cunt’.

John Pearson, who specialises in Emerging Markets at Goldman Sach’s Old City District offices, said he’s fielded many phone calls this week, from local media to law enforcement – all enquiring whether his youngest son, Liam, was a half-way crook.

“Thank you all for coming,” said Mr Pearson to the growing media scrum forming outside his rooms.

“First of all, I’d like to apologise to anybody in the community who has had their phone and wallet taken by Liam over the years. For that, I am truly apologetic and the buck ultimately stops with me. Secondly, to the police and legal system. Thank you for being so patient with my son and we are working on getting him therapy for his anger problems,”

“Lastly, I would like to confirm reports that my son is a ‘toy cunt’. He was educated at the Whooton School For Boys in Betoota Grove, where he excelled in debating, orchestra and rugby union football. Despite being 23, he still lives at home with his mother and I in Betoota Grove. Last night, we had filet mignon for dinner. He is harmless. That’s all I’m going to say at this stage, thank you very much.”

Those in the adlay industry have been calling for Mr Pearson to address these rumours for months now and this latest admission by the BMW-owner is confirmation of what many were thinking.

For a number of years now, Liam Pearson has been living under the illusion that his quiet, privileged upbringing in Betoota Grove has been more of a curse on him than a blessing.

Soon after he finished school, gone were his usual drab of boat shoes, Canterbury footy shorts and a polo shirt and in its place, Nike TN trainers and tracksuits.

His parents noted his backpack jingled whenever he left the house of an evening.

“Turns out he was spending the money we gave him for sailing lessons on tins of Ironlak,” said John.

“Then he was spray painting his tag on buses, trains and fences around Betoota Grove. I mean for God’s sake, some of those fences belonged to my friends!”

The Advocate reached out to Liam for comment but discovered he was currently holidaying in his parent’s northern hemisphere base in Belgravia, Central London.

He did not respond to our emails.

PM Enjoys A 440mL Monster Can At Smoko In Bid To Understand The Common Man

TEXT:

Observing the men currently building the fence blocking the public from accessing the top of Parliament House this morning, the Prime Minister saw them sitting around in a circle at 10 am in some sort of ritual.

Malcolm Turnbull, intrigued by this Pagan-type doing, asked his driver to stop.

He strode confidently up the hill toward the workmen to ask just what in God’s green Earth they were doing.

“We’re on smoko, Malcolm,” said unskilled labourer, Darcy Feild, who didn’t even get up to shake the outstretched hand of the Member for Wentworth.

“I see. What’s that you’re drinking? Is that cigarette taking the edge off life? Ah yes. I imagine it would. I’ve never smoked much in my life, you see,”

“Only when Kerry Packer used to force me to. Anyway, is this what you do every day?” asked Turnbull.

“What, you mean enjoy a cold can of Monster and a John Player Special? Yeah, I guess we do, Prime Minister,” replied Darcy.

“You should try it some time. You know? You might even slouch like me a bit – like a bloke who’s broken shit up and thrown it in a skip all day? Maybe try getting shitfaced at the Club after work then get kicked off the courtesy bus for smoking? That’s how I live my life.”

Malcolm pursed his lips and help a fountain pen to them.

“Ok. I’ll give it a go,” he said, shaking Darcy’s hand before trundling back down the hill to his double-parked BMW.

And earlier this morning, closer to 12 than 11, Malcolm Turnbull kicked back in his office chair and cracked a big old cold tin of Monster and pulled the plastic wrap from a fresh deck of Peter Stuyvesant Classics with his teeth.

Spitting the wrap onto the floor, he flicked the bottom of the deck and pulled the highest jumping dart out and put it back in upside down.

“We used to do that in the 80s,” said Turnbull to a mortified staffer.

“Shit. Can you run down to The Nationals wing and get me a lighter? Nobody up here smokes anymore! Do you think Chris Pyne knows what it’s like out there in the trenches? With all the smokers? I think not!”

Upon the staffer’s return, Malcolm lit up, took a deep breath and let the headspins pull him into his seat like he was feeling 6Gs in a Hornet.

“Ah yes. I can see the attraction in this now,” he said.

“Marvellous. I haven’t felt so in touch with the nation since I went to Lou Reed back in 2004. Walking on the wild side I am, Lou. Vale my friend.”

Mum’s Gone A Bit Overboard Buying Grog For Her Royal Wedding Party

TEXT:

If the last Royal Wedding was anything to go by, a polite and homely homemaker from Betoota Grove has purchased a substantial amount of alcohol in preparation for the party she’s hosting on the big day.

Wanda Coleman, of Greenbow Road, was seen picking out grog down at the Cobb & Co Cellars in the leafy enclave’s shopping strip earlier today.

In her cart stood a dozen bottles of red, two dozen longnecks of rose lying down horizontally – plus an additional six bottles of overproof Bundaberg Rum, one bottle of Southern Comfort, two flagons of complex fruity lexia, four cans of Betoota Bitter, a carton of Marlboro Red town smokes, four 50 gram pouches of Port Royal and a bottle of Bolinger for when they couple say ‘I do’.

“That should be enough,” she said to the sales attendant, who was coming to terms with the fact that all of this alcohol was going to be put through a dozen 60-year-old livers.

Wanda laughed as the employee asked for just over twelve hundred dollars.

He even helped her take it out to her late model Commodore, which had a few floor chimes rolling around under the passenger seat already.

Just before the boot slammed shut, our reporter caught up with Mrs Coleman before she left.

“It’s just the worst when you run out of grog,” she said.

“That’s why I got so much. Even if we don’t get through it, we can have it later,”

“I’m famous for my Royal Wedding Parties around town. I had my first one with Diana. Penny Turner is bringing the sandwiches, cucumber of course! Diana Brooks has got her hands on some cocaine, just like it’s the 80s! Looking forward to Saturday, it’ll be a big one. Come by if your not doing anything, though. Where those shorts I see you in down at the pool! [laughs]”

Did You Know: Cate Blanchett Actually Married The Tim Tam Genie From That Ad In 1994

TEXT:

In a time when shows like Blue Heelers ruled the screens, and Mariah Carey just wanted you for Christmas, a young and unknown Cate Blanchett says she met the love of her life, the Tim Tam genie.

Yep, that’s right. The guy from that ad, all those years ago, is now married to one of the most famous actresses in the world.

Talk about finding a golden ticket on the bottom of a Tim Tam tray.

The now two time Oscar winner and seven-time nominee first appeared on our screens over 20 years ago in that random ad, and, on that fateful set, Blanchett says her and the Genie hit it off.

A couple of decades later and Blanchett says that despite reaching the giddying heights of Hollywood, she and her husband are still going steady.

Her husband Steve, (who unlike Cate) remained in anonymity for the rest of his days, and now works as a Sales Rep at Hunter’s Hill JB HiFi, when the family isn’t travelling on a private jet to Hollywood, or their countryside manor in Essex, UK.

52-year-old Steve, the former genie, told The Advocate that he also featured in a Hungry Jacks ad in 1996 and only just missed out on the ‘is Don, is Good’ ad from the same era.

“Ah what could have been aye,” he said to our European Correspondent as he herded a few sheep in the hobby farm.

“I guess I am just lucky I met Cate really. Very lucky. I mean, I’ll never really come to terms with what was missing in my career, but hey, I met a beautiful woman who’s done incredible things. My life could have been a whole lot different” he said. 

“Plus I got to hang out with Elijah Wood heaps in New Zealand.”

Recent Cold Weather A God-Send For Local Slow News Cycle

TEXT:

The executive producer of the IMP-9 Imparja Betoota collapsed into the newsroom beanbag this morning defeated.

Stacey Macklin flipped through the local and metropolitan newspapers all morning.

Browsed reddit for an hour and even stopped by the popular hacking website, 4chan.

Nothing.

So she did what any self-respecting newsperson does and reports on the only thing you can when there’s nothing else to report on.

She invited our reporter into the television newsroom she commands to speak freely about her thoughts regarding the current news cycle.

“For the midday bulletin, we lead with the recent cold weather down there in the deep south,” she said.

“Those Victorians, Tasmanians and other assortments of rabble down there have been taken by surprise again by an antarctic blast. They do every year and you can crack jokes about that until the cows have their lambs,”

“But I digress. That’s not the problem. The problem is that there’s nothing beside abject tragedy and sport to report on at the moment. Nothing. We’re almost praying that juicy news like Peter Beattie getting caught with half a bag of hoota under a Southbank palm tree comes down the news wire. But until then, I guess we’re just going to have to report on how seasonably cold it is in fucking Melbourne.”

Macklin kicked her Ariat boots off, got up on the chief-of-staff’s desk and stretched one sock over the newsroom smoke alarm.

She threw her head back in the beanbag and lit a John Player Special.

“It is too much to ask?” she said.

Anarchist’s War On Commercialism On Hold To Buy Mum A Present For Mother’s Day

TEXT:

The last time Sam Pearson was brought before the attention of the local courts and The Advocate, he was charged with assaulting a police horse and throwing rocks at delegates from the Betoota Chamber of Commerce during a civil disturbance in 2009.

While he escaped the charges, largely because his asset-rich family commands a large amount of power around town, he’s still stuck to the cause of taking it to the man.

Our reporter caught up with Sam this morning at an unassuming French Quarter Cafe where he spoke freely about the toughest day of the year for anarchists, anti-fascist and anti-capitalism people such as him.

Mother’s Day.

“It was a day created by card companies and department stores to drive up their sales. That’s it,” said the 28-year-old.

“Bullshit, it is. But I can’t say that to Mum. She doesn’t mind that I have primal need to burn cop cars and punch Nazis but if I turned up to brunch tomorrow with nothing, it’d crush her,”

“So my war on the man is on hold today. I’m doing to bite my tongue and head down to David Jones in the Old City District after this interview and get a nice cookbook or something. I’ll even ask the homely lady behind the counter to gift wrap it because I’m a piece of shit,”

“Anyway, your newspaper sucks and I look forward to putting your head on a pike when the purge comes. It’s been real.”

Middle Manager Validates Existence By Making Small Change To Project Just For The Fuck Of It

TEXT:

Not many of Gavin Harrison’s coworkers know exactly what he does all day, they just know he does something.

He’s been working at the somewhat-esteemed-local-mezzanine-level-advertising-agency, Clemenger South Betoota, for nearly a decade – where he’s had a hand in creating and maintaining key accounts and things like that which are important.

When something comes across his desk from either a client or a creative muggle from pod seven, he doesn’t always need to make a change – but if he didn’t, what point is there of him being there in the first place?

“I always find something that I don’t like about something,” he told The Advocate this afternoon.

“Whether it be copy from one of our copywriter that doesn’t quite, in my opinion, mesh with what the client wants – or even feedback from the client that I need to pass on, I never pass it on without making a change and adding my two cents,”

“That’s what being in middle management is all about. To be an economic, social and spiritual handbrake on my company – and the industry in general. I’ve seen perfectly good copy come back and I’ve just made a change just for the fuck of it. In fact, do that all the time. When I give feedback, I try to be as vague and cryptic as humanly possible as well. All in a day’s work, I guess!”

As it was 4 pm on a Friday afternoon, our reporter wasn’t hopeful on making contact with anyone at the firm to provide comment on the matter.

Nobody at the Clemenger South Betoota was available to speak with The Advocate this afternoon – except for Gavin, who wasn’t told were the work drinks were.

Ageing Journalist Sits Down To Pen Yet Another Thinkpiece On Who Millennials Really Are

TEXT:

After finding himself at a loose end with nothing left to write about for the weekend paper, Darcy Boyd, a popular columnist in the Sunday Advocate, has decided to pen his second thinkpiece on Millennials this year.

This week, he plans to go into bat for the younger generations, saying they’ve had it tough and they work hard.

But this comes after the first controversial piece he published this year in the January 7 edition of The Sunday Advocate which said Millennials and Gen Y were ultimately responsible for the death of the Australian dream.

“I think I’m going to call it, ‘Who Are The Millennials And What Do They Want?’ – that’s got a good ring to it. I’ve got two sons in their mid-20s of my own, both full-time-stay-at-home at the moment but we’re trying to find them work here at The Betoota Advocate,”

“That fact alone qualifies me to write on these young people. I’m at the coalface of their abject laziness and conceited nature. They were both offered copyboy positions but turned them down because they felt they deserved to start at a higher level. Why, I started as a copyboy here in 1967!”

“But they’ve done it tough. Expensive tuition fees, almost zero wage growth in their lifetime, hyper-inflated housing caused by foreign investment and tax incentives for elderly investors such as I. All this an more will be explored in my Sunday column so be sure to pick it up!”

However, he has to get it past The Advocate‘s editor, Clancy Overell, who said that thinkpieces such as the one Boyd plans to publish are starting to get tiresome.

Citing a recent incident that happened in the days after Boyd published his first article – where he was accosted by a group of South Betoota Polytechnic students and ultimately had a Sector 9 skateboard broken over his head – Overell said he wasn’t sold on publishing it.

“I’m not sure we have the insurance to cover this should the youth take offence to what he writes again,” he said.

“What if he gets knocked off like RFK down the IGA or something? That’d be on me and the sociopaths at Allianz insurance who cover his life. But I prefer the tone of this one to the last one. But look,”

“I’d get a Millennial to write a thinkpiece on Millennials if I could actually employ one long enough. I’m sick of getting six good months out of them before they resign in May and summer in Europe, only to come back and start pouring beers to pay the credit card. Just go to Port Douglas and shoot a few dolphins like I do on holiday.”

Truckie Reminisces On Time In Prison As Motor Inn Breakfast Slides Under Door

TEXT:

“Except this time it’s actually food you might want to eat!” he said.

“It always takes me right back to solitary. When they’d open the little hatch in the door and slide the food in. I always enjoy staying in motor inns. Very nostalgic for me,”

“Even the decor reminds me of the Wacol rec room we had access to if we weren’t too naughty. Glad to be out, but. Good to have work, you know?”

Mark Douglas, of Blackall, has been out of prison for almost a decade and a half but somethings, such as having a motor inn breakfast slid under a door at 5am, take him right back there.

Last night, he pulled into the Captain Starlight Motor Inn on the Betoota City Limit to rest his weary head after a marathon drive up from Adelaide.

But he wasn’t going to drift off the sleep without filling in his breakfast menu card which dangled from the front doorknob.

Smiling to himself, after two hard days’ drive, he ticked every single box on that card. From avocado to zucchini fritters – it was clean that Mark was going to feast when he woke.

“They had to slide two plates under the door, I ordered that much,” he said.

“And you’d be goddamn right if you said I ate it all. I feel fantastic. I’ve only got to drive up to Blackall today so it’s nice and easy. But yeah, still can’t get over the fact that places still slide your breakfast under the door like you’re in prison,”

“The novelty of it never wears off.”

Bored Homeowner With Nothing Left To Do Becomes Mature-Age Student

TEXT:

Some accuse Gilbert Speers of enrolling in a Bachelor Of Business Studies out of spite – just to make sure another young person didn’t get the spot in the course.

Others say the slow expansion of the 67-year-old jam and preserve business warrants further tertiary study.

But if you ask Gil himself, it’s about keeping his mind active.

Enroling in the three-year course at South Betoota Polytechnic College earlier this year, Speers took little time to defend his position at the illustrious business school.

“I’m just as entitled to be here as anyone else,” he said.

“You see, I’ve been retired for so long now. Almost 25 years and there’s only so many hands of bridge you play before you long for something else,”

“So I thought I’d go back to university. Christ, it’s expensive these days! Back when I was here in the 70s, it was basically free. Anyway, got to find ways to spend the kid’s inheritance! I’d rather die on the cold wet tiles in my bathroom than see some young family move buy my house. Anyway, it’s good to get my brain working again.”

Gil also highlighted that the degree could also give him the keys to reenter the workforce later on – should he be sufficiently bored with his life.

“That’d be grand,” he said.

“The sad thing is that I’ve got so much knowledge up in this head of mine that I want to share with younger generations. I can do that in the workforce but not right now. I don’t want to give them an unfair advantage over me in the exams!”

Melbourne Installs Snowmaking Guns Around CBD In Latest Push To Be More European

TEXT:

The incumbent Premier of Victoria has blamed the lack of local government leadership in Melbourne for some recent developments surrounding the installation of powerful snowmaking guns in the city’s central business district.

Premier Daniel Andrews admitted to our reporter that he didn’t know who made the decision to put snowmaking guns up and down the footpaths of the free-tram zone but he was ‘sure as shit’ going to find out.

“This is not a good idea,” he said.

“Just when you thought things couldn’t get any worse in Melbourne’s local government, it gets worse. My team will be investigating this and do everything in our power to make sure it doesn’t go ahead.”

However, The Advocate can reveal the decision to put these snowmaking devices in the heart of Australia’s second most European city (behind Bernie) was made by a consortium of CBD business owners hellbent on stealing the crown from the Tasmanian fishing village.

An owner-operator of a 24HR book and bicycle shop on Lonsdale Street spoke to our reporter about the plans via wireless telephone this morning.

“We [local business owners] all got together one night over a 4am pizza and Malbec and lamented the fact that it doesn’t snow in Melbourne,”

“A collective sigh echoed from the corner of that small bar, pangs of our time in Neukölln hung in the air for all to see. So we came up with a plan. We rubbed our ironic tattoos together all night until they blistered trying to come up with something avante gard [sic],”

“So we went on Alibaba and bought some snowmaking machines. I had to pretty much ride my tandem bike solo, which is pretty much the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do, like ever, like all the way to South Yarra to beg my parents to loan me the money. It didn’t go well but we raised the money by busking down at Fed Square with my sister’s bassoon and my friend Dave’s windchimes.”

The Advocate contacted the Mayor of Melbourne’s office for comment but the hold music was Dave Hughes doing bits about kids shitting on the rug so we hung up.

Government Deny New Cuts To ABC Budget Have Anything To Do With Their Bias

TEXT:

This May budget has revealed new details about cuts to the ABC’s annual budget while the government has had to defend their decision by saying they weren’t motivated by revenge.

Scott Morrison took the opportunity to address the media this morning at a doorstop outside Parliament where he was asked by an ABC reporter about the slashings.

“Where the cuts motivated by our left-wing, academic, city-centric bias?” asked the Radio National content creator.

The Treasurer shared a laugh with a Sky News reporter and the person who has Charles Croucher’s old at Channel Nine.

“Of course not,” he said.

“This budget is about returning to surplus. The ABC is like a black hole that you throw money into and nothing comes back out. Plus, the people receiving the money don’t even like us to begin with,”

“Which means, in layman’s terms for you, we want bang for our buck. The ABC is a cash negative investment for the government and the taxpayer, so we’re not going to waste our time and your money. Hell, I want to move the ABC out west to Parramatta in Sydney. Maybe those people might have to interact with a real person for once in their lives. Move the ABC in Melbourne out to Frankston!”

“Maybe if they started giving us a return on our investment, we’d be willing to give them more funding.”

The media scrum collectively shrugged and the Treasurer’s media advisor ushered him inside.

Disgraced Former AMP Directors Apologise To Shareholders For Getting Caught

TEXT:

Three non-executive directors of embattled wealth manager AMP will step down ahead of the annual general meeting later this year in response to the Royal Commission’s shocking findings.

They have chosen not to stand for re-election to the board after the fallout continues to spread.

Legally, The Advocate has been slapped with a suppression order and cannot publish their names without the danger of being sued back into the 60s.

“We’re sorry for getting caught,” said one disgraced director.

“Aside from all the bomb-ass returns we got you, we now know that we got those profits for you unethically and for that, we are sorry,”

“To my colleagues in the banking sector, please don’t judge us. To the shareholders, please don’t abandon us for a far more ‘above-board’ wealth management service. She who is without sin, cast the first stone.”

The Advocate spoke to a local AMP shareholder about the continuing damage done to the company by the Royal Commission’s findings – and he isn’t too amused.

“The share price has cooled, that’s for sure,” he said.

“Look, I’ll level with you. I don’t really give a flying fuck what AMP does with my money. If they can keep it around 10% and lather me with dividends, I’m happy,”

“They could invest in nuclear weapons and cigarettes for all I care. All I want is for the car to work when I got to get petrol for the jet ski. If they can guarantee me that, then carry on being crooks I say.”

Former PM Bob Hawke Admitted To Hospital After Reading Scott Morrison’s Budget

TEXT:

A Former Prime Minister is in hospital this morning after flicking through the Treasurer’s Federal Budget which has been dubbed ‘the mother of all political budgets’.

Bob Hawke was taken to Royal North Shore Private Hospital in Sydney’s leafy inheritance belt earlier this morning after taking in just what Scott Morrison’s May budget means for ordinary Australians.

Shortly before 6 this morning, Hawke was heard groaning and sighing heavily while he read an advance copy of the budget before complaining of chest tightness and general malaise.

Scott Morrison was blasted today by his former Liberal Party counterpart, Peter Costello, who said he should’ve never given Hawke a copy of the budget in his old age.

Costello spoke to The Advocate regarding the developments moments ago.

“I mean, what did he think would happen?” said Peter.

“Bob is widly–regarded, albiet foolishly, as being a true economic champion of the Australian people. A social one, maybe. Certainly not Mr 18% interest rates, he was an economic vandal compared to me. Scott will be playing squash with Paul the Apostle by the time these debts are paid off,”

“If you have a baby now, you might as well throw it in the creek because even they will be dead before this country is out of the can. I’ve even taken up a new hobby. I sit in my car out the front of maternity hospitals and I chastise people for reproducing as they’re walking out. We’re all going to burn in hell.”

Former High School Footy Hero Begins Wearing Glasses In Bid To Be Taken Seriously

TEXT:

A mildly popular local grain trader has shared his touching journey to being taken seriously today after spending most of his early life being good at sport.

Sam Spencer-Brown played fly-half for the Whooton School 1st XV for two full seasons back in 2006 and it seemed nothing could stop his meteoric rise in popularity and future prospects.

However, after being rushed into Super Rugby at just 19-years-old from the prestigious Cambellwell College team at South Betoota Polytechnic, he suffered multiple injuries and had to focus on his studies.

“It was a really dark time for me,” he said.

“I went from being the most popular bloke in school to being just another university graduate with two fucked knees and an internship at Suncorp. Nobody really took me seriously after that,”

“So I made a change. Even though I don’t really need glasses, I got a pair because a reinvention was necessary for me to move onto the next phase of my life. I really happy with the results.”

The 31-year-old has noticed a huge change.

Friends and co-workers say he has the air of an academic and the blind confidence of someone who thinks they are.

“He’s taken this rebrand quiet seriously,” the friend said.

“Now he’s all serious and stoic. Like a wise old soul that’s read lots of books. He’s been reading The Barefoot Investor for the past four weeks. I can see right through those glasses.”

Daredevil Showcases Nerves Of Steel By Keeping Eyes Closed During Turbulence

TEXT:

If there’s one thing that united mankind, it is our collective fear of dying in a plane crash.

No aircraft in history has been rattled from the sky by turbulence before but that doesn’t stop passengers from screaming, hollering and crying during especially bumpy patches of air.

All except Amy Hurshell, a local primary educator.

Flying into Remienko Memorial Aerodrome earlier today, the 26-year-old reportedly kept her eyes closed and seemed unperturbed by a patch of turbulence somewhere over Toompine today.

Witnesses have told The Advocate that Amy rocked violently along with the plane while those around her clung on for dear life.

One man allegedly suffered a heart attack about the Diamantina Air Freight DC-6 and died right there in his business class seat while his fellow travellers looked on helplessly.

A pilot has also told our reporter that he thought he was going to die.

However, the popular Abercrombie Road Primary School teacher seemed to be the only one on the plane who knew she’d live to educate another day.

The lionhearted Gemini spoke to our reporter moments ago.

“I knew I was going to be OK,” she said.

“Planes don’t crash because of turbulence. They crash because of things like terrorism, poor maintenance and pilots that fuck everything up. That and I had got a stack of reports to get through when I got home so I didn’t really care if I lived or died,”

“I’m not a hero, though. I’m by no means brave. Tired, yeah.”

There was a time when Tom Carter-Greenpoint’s name would strike fear into the hearts of all the other boys at his exclusive Betoota Grove private school – but that time is long gone.

It was over a decade ago, 2006 to be exact.

Then 16 and three quarters, Tom and his closest friends used to trade their neckties and black RMs they wear to school each day for an Ecko hoodie and a well-worn pair of Air Maxes.

The classic novels and advanced math books were thrown from their backpacks and were replaced with tin after tin of Ironlak – they were ready for the night.

The Advocate reported on the rising graffiti damage done to properties that summer but it’s not until now that the mischievous Libra has decided to come forward.

“I was a different person back then,” he said.

“I was so bored at night, I just needed to get out of the house. So rather than playing mixed touch with the St Augustines boarders at night, my and two of my best beds would go out and paint our tags on fences around the neighbourhood,”

“It was fun, though. We did a huge panel on a wheat train with these real G’s from Betoota Ponds Sports High. That was sick. I got arrested once and told the police man to go fuck himself. That was a rush. It was a rush until he up-ended me with his baton! Ah well. Oh to be young again.”

Baby Boomer Asks Cabbie Where They Are Really From

For 63-year-old Dennis Costello, the idea of a cab driver simply being from ‘The Goldie’ is a bit unrealistic.

Upon getting into the cab one the way from the airport this arvo, the semi-retired aviation maintenance consultant from Brisbane’s Northern Suburbs was quick to notice the slight accent, as well as the noticeably not white skin of his driver.

“Where are you from, mate?” asks Dennis.

“The Goldie” says his cab driver, Tony.

“Actually just North of the Gold Coast, more Coomera, you know where that is”

Dennis, noticeably not satisfied with Tony’s answer is quick to avoid talking about where his driver thinks he’s from, and focus on where he is really from.

“Yeah, I know Coomera. How long have you been living there?”

“But that’s not where are you REALLY from, right?”

“Where’d you come from?”

Tony, who isn’t really sure why the fuck this old cunt is so keen on asking him these kinds of personal questions, makes a point of not gratifying him by saying he isn’t from Australia.

“Ummm” he says.

“Well I used to live in Salisbury”

“You know where that is?”

Dennis, still not content with the answer, tries to keep it up for a bit longer, but is cut off by Tony asking him what part of England he is from.

Personal Trainer Gets Sleeve After Reading ‘The Subtle Art Of Not Giving A Fuck’

TEXT:

A Betoota Ponds personal trainer has admitted to The Advocate this afternoon that the only thing that previously stopped him from getting a sleeve tattoo was the seven fucks he had left to give.

However, upon reading New York Times Bestseller, The Subtle Art Of Not Giving A Fuck, Dennis Pooley cast those fucks to the wayside and booked an appointment at Betoota Ink.

“I had concerns, some fucks, that I’d live to regret getting the tattoo,” he told our reporter.

“Like how it’d look when I got older, when my skin looked like an old basketball that’d been stuck up on the garage roof for seven years. But then a mate said I should read ‘The Subtle Art Of Not Giving A Fuck’ and lo and behold, I had the sleeve done last week,”

“Mate, I shit you not. This book will change your life. Do you have any fucks keeping you from doing the things you want to do in life? If so, read this book and you’ll be living like a free man in no time at all. Peace brother, I’m out. but if you want to lose 10kg in just four weeks, give me a bell.”

As sunny as it seems on Mr Pooley’s side of the road, all is not well in the land of no fucks – according to one local tramp who said the book cost him everything he had.

Wallace Wilmott, who lives on a bench in Machattie Park dedicated to The Advocate’s editor Clancy Overell’s late grandfather, said that he was once a high-flying Red Rooster franchisee but after reading the book, he said his life began to unravel.

“My credit card bill came in the mail and I just laughed and said ‘fuck you’ and threw it out on the footpath,” he said.

“Then my identity got stolen and lost thousands. I just shrugged and said I’ve got no fucks left to give. I got behind on my mortgage of the family home, the one I grew up in, so I challenged the bank manager to a game of roshambo. He said ‘what?’ so I went first and booted him in the nuts like I was kicking it from 60,”

“I spent 30 days in prison for common assault and public nuisance. Went home, locks were changed and some squatters had moved in. I could see through the window, one of them shat in the room I was born in,”

“Long story short, don’t read this evil book. It will ruin your life. You need to give a fuck in life or else it goes to shit.”

Smug, Gainfully Employed Friend Puts Wealth On Display And Gets Footlong With Avocado

TEXT:

Mia Nguyen (20) shocked her peers today. 

The young Media and Arts Production student at the Betoota Polytechnic was simply out purchasing lunch with a couple of her friends from university, when she caused a stir. 

Nguyen, like most of the students in town lives pretty week to week with with most of the cash from her Youth Allowance and part time job going towards a room in a French Quarter share house. 

After that, she has to outlay a fair chunk of her disposable income on other early university year necessities like weed and alcohol. 

As you can probably imagine, that doesn’t leave a whole lot left for much else. 

So that’s why her friends were taken aback when Nguyen asked for avocado on her footlong subway. 

The Brisbane woman said that she had a bit of money left over for the week and like all good young hedonists, felt like she deserved a little treat. 

“I had a reasonably big night working on some stupid fucking essay about Foucault and discourse analysis, so if ever I needed something nice it was today,” Nguyen said. 

“Besides, I went with the cheap sub of the day so I’m not breaking the bank, and it’s probably going to be my only meal of the day,” she laughed. 

Amy Fish, a friend of the eligible bachelorette explained the reaction from the social group. 

“It’s just not something you hear that often anymore you know. I mean, that’s a goon sunrise, or a 6 pack of Mi Goreng, but I guess you do have to treat yourself sometimes don’t you.” 

“Good on her! I personally would have spent my spare coin on some cookies, but each to their own as they say I guess.”

Cardinal George Pell has lashed out at the media, the legal system and the wider Australian people in a sensational attack, saying he’s a victim of Tall Poppy Syndrome and that everybody is just jealous of his on-going career success.

The Catholic Church’s leader in Australia did the lashing outside the Victorian Supreme Court were he’s booked in the fight historical child sex abuse charges later in the year.

“I see what’s going on here,” he said, waving his finger at the media.

“You’re all jealous of the groove I’ve carved for myself. My success. All the hard work I’ve done, all the hours I’ve sacrificed to get where I am. Go ahead, call me a sell-out! I don’t care. You’re all peasants with that toxic crab mentality that’s hardwired into every red-blooded Australian. You’re all crabs! Fucking crabs!”

“Well, I don’t care! I’m going to beat these charges then rub my success in all your faces. Jesus might love you but I think you’re all cunts! Each and every last bloodsucking one of you!”

Some reporters there were taken aback by the Cardinal’s outburst.

Portugal. The Man Saddened To Learn Paul From Caboolture Now Hates Them

TEXT:

Grammy-award-winning Alaskan band Portugal. The Man has reportedly ‘had their heart ripped out’ over some developing news that Paul from Caboolture, on Queensland’s answer to the Amalfi Coast, no longer likes their music and now hates them.

The news comes after the touring Alaskan band pulled out of a gig with controversial breakfast television show, Sunrise, citing the broadcast surrounding Aboriginal adoptions and the Stolen Generation.

The segment, which aired last month, was met with widespread and unbridled criticisms from the wider Australian populace – save a few vocal pockets of discontent.

In a statement released via social media today, the band address Paul directly about his newfound loathing for the American sextet.

To Paul, from Caboolture,

We’re saddened and moved by the news that you now hate us because we chosen not to allign outselves with Sunrise. We understand that Kochie & Mel and the rest of the gang are important to you, however, they are not important to us at this time. We urge you to reconsider just how much you hate us now and to open your heart to those in your community who you haven’t previously in the past.

With peace, love and music,

Band with weird name.

The Advocate reached out to Paul via Facebook Messenger earlier this afternoon and chatted with him for close to an hour about his feelings toward the band and the wider controversy that triggered their decision to dodge the show before The Morning Show.

As close to all of what he said is not fit to print, our reporters have selected some key responses that should help the reader come to a balanced conclusion.

“They should just stay out of politics and play their fucking tracks,” wrote Paul.

“I hate it when musos [sic] start getting political. I hate it even more when they speak about against what I believe in. It just makes me so fucking angry. Everything makes me angry. Anyway, they just got one less fan by pulling out of Sunrise,”

“And I’m glad it hurt them. I’m glad they took the time to reach out to me on their ‘gram and Facey. I’m not going to respond. Fuck ’em. Fuck everybody that doesn’t believe in what I believe in. Above all, I’m just so disappointed.”

Bloke Actually Named Jimmy Recard Turns Out To Be A Bit Of A Gimp

TEXT:

A local pool water purity specialist named Jimmy Recard is actually not very fun to be around, despite the expectation that comes with his name.

Recard (33) has never once had glasses raised to him as though he was the king of the bar, in fact he doesn’t really go out that much.

“I’m more into gaming” he says.

“And not Fortnite or any of those games you are thinking about, I’m more of a PC kinda guy. Still love getting down to some StarCraft”

These revelations come as a stark contrast to the first single released by Australian Hip Hop artist, Drapht, taken from his third album, Brothers Grimm.

The song, titled “Jimmy Recard” received airplay on radio stations across Australia, and has been praised for it’s confronting lyricism.

It is regarded as one of the most fervent and important Aussie Hip Hop tracks of the last two decades, due to it’s unflinching subtext, which discusses a contrived sense of identity for Australian males in the years immediately following the invasion of Iraq.

The single reached #10 on the 2008 Triple J Hottest 100.

However, a mere conversation with an man actually named Jimmy Recard is quick to undermine the whole premise of the song. If anything, Jimmy’s is far from the man of the millennium. With ladies rarely swinging their bras at him.

“It happened once” he said.

“But they were aiming for the stage. It was at Nickelback concert I went to with some of my cousins in Hillsong”

“I Was Enjoying The Comedy Show Until He Made A Joke About People Like Me”

TEXT:

It was supposed to be a nice night out on the town.

Two glasses of house red, perhaps a two-sentence half-laugh conversation with a stranger about a parking meter. Dinner was also on the cards – for dessert, a comedy show at the Betoota Heights PCYC.

The night was Filip Doolan’s oyster and things could not be better.

His steak down at the Dolphins Club was perfectly cooked and the side salad was red onion heavy. Just the way he liked it. A dry heat lingered in the air and the 49-year-old had just the right amount of malbec sloshing around in him to feel like he was on top of the world.

But it all came crashing down about 40 minutes into John New Holland’s new comedy show aptly named: “I Used To Shoot Turtles, Now I Just Shoot The Water.”

“I’ve never been more offended in my life,” said Doolan.

“He tried to poke fun at SES volunteers and all the hard work they put into helping others. I’m sorry, buster, but that’s not on,”

“So I gave him a piece of my mind, that curly-haired fuck.”

For the record, the line in which Mr Doolan took offence to was as follows:

I reckon those SES people and the RFS compete to see who can do the least amount of work at a bushfire or flood. Like seeing who can lean on a shovel the longest without being told to do something.

Our reporter spoke to John New Holland this morning who said he doesn’t recall the heckling (as it’s known in comedy circles) but that’s probably because he got on the lash after the show.

But he did share some insights into the rare type of human that stops laughing and starts shouting.

“I mean, yeah,” he said sitting in his filthy Harrison Ford-style brown leather jacket.

“People like that can be good or they can be bad. When it’s like those old white men jangling their fucking keychains with all their fucken keys to all the houses they own, it’s usually good. I don’t remember the one last night, probably a good thing, hey watch out!”

“Ok man, I’m going to lie down. I’ve got two shows tonight and these Volleys aren’t going to wash themselves, alright!”

Local Tradie’s Bloodwork Reveals He’s 80% Iced Coffee

TEXT:

Betoota Valley carpenter Jackson Alexander (28) has today got back the results to a blood test insisted upon by his doctor – and things don’t look good. For the majority of homo sapiens, 60% their body is made up of water, however, in Jackson’s case, his bloodwork revealed he is in fact 80% iced coffee milk.

“Yeah, shit.” Jackson said in response to the results.

“I guess it’s not that surprising if I think about it. It’s been 72 hours since I had my last sip of water.”

“Iced coffee goes better with a sausage roll, but.”

Dr. Charles, Jackson’s doctor, advised him to get a blood test after a routine checkup showed some abnormalities in his breathing, he explains.

“His breathing was like that of a 60-year-old emphysema sufferer, only he showed no other symptoms of the condition.”

“I’m somewhat relieved to know his lungs are just full of iced coffee rather than having a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.” Said Dr. Charles, trying to find a positive in a still very alarming situation.

“I know it may not be cool, per se, to drink water on a work site, but Jackson must start drinking water or he will die.”

Despite hearing this advice from his Doctor, Jackson was spotted walking out of the west Betoota BP with an iced coffee and what is suspected to be an egg sandwich.

Domestic Air Hostess Couldn’t Give Less Of A Fuck During Safety Briefing

TEXT:

It’s the most boring part of every flight, and for Shantell Skynner the in-flight safety demonstration is particularly painstaking today. Shantell, who is an air hostess on board Diamantina Air’s Sydney to Betoota flight, is today struggling to hide her lack of interest in the passengers’ safety.

“If there’s an emergency, get into the brace position,” said Shantell with little emotion or inflexion.

“If an oxygen mask…” Shantell pauses, then sighs before continuing.

“If an oxygen mask falls down, put your own on first. Then help your kid.”

“Exits are there, there and there,” she said while vaguely pointing towards the front, middle and back of the plane.

One of our reporters, who was returning from reporting on the Banking Royal Commission, was able to ask a few fellow passengers how they were feeling about Shantell’s lack of enthusiasm for their safety.

“Umm yeah, it’s a bit concerning. It’s like she’s ordering a happy meal at Macca’s, not relaying valuable information that could save our lives.” said, one passenger.

“I think I saw her sleeping on an inflated life jacket” noted another.

Thankfully the flight landed safely at Betoota International and the passengers didn’t need to put into action any of Shantell’s half-hearted safety instructions. When asked whether Shantell’s demeanour would discourage them from flying Diamantina Air again, all passengers answered with a resounding ‘no’.

Looks like Australia’s safest airline will take more than a lazy air hostess knock it off its number one spot.

New Diet Must Be Serious After Salad Is Chosen Instead Of Chips

TEXT:

Harley Billings (26) has shown his commitment to a new cause today, after ordering a pub meal, and specifically requesting salad, instead of chips.

The happily engaged teacher from the Golf Course Estate told our reporters today that he had promised himself, and his partner that he was going to give this whole diet thing a go.

“Yeah, I am starting to blow out a little. You know, that comfortable relationship, mid 20’s kind of mass you put on around the chest and belly region,” he explained.

“So I told myself that I was going to start cutting down and watching what I eat. And little sacrifices like, salad instead of chips, is one way to stop the ballooning.”

Billings, however, has confirmed, however, that he will still have some of his mate’s chips though.

“Just a couple.”

“Not like heaps, like just one or two,” Billings said.

This, however, has angered friends of Billings, who told The Advocate that he should have just ordered his own.

“Fuck off, order your own fucking chips,” said Tom Harvey, a friend of Billings.

“It’s unbelievable. It’s like I am at the beach, and I’ve got a seagull trying to get at my chips,” said Harvey a ‘chippy’ from the Flightpath District.

“It’s not my fault Charlene’s been giving him a hard time and he has gone ahead and ordered lettuce to go with his steak. Not my fault out all.”

Apathetic Gen-Y Says He’d Care More About UberEats Cyclists If They Weren’t Always Late

TEXT:

Friends of Joshua Blade-Morgan say he’s a bright young man – which is why he often collects all the facts before making his judgement.

“That’s why I guess he’s so apathetic toward those UberEats cyclists,” said one pal.

“He understands we live in a vapid, soulless and capitalistic world that’s wholly dictated by the almighty dollar. Which is why he often feels empathy for the shocking, disgusting work environment that these poor UberEats delivery people are subjected to,”

“But at the same time, he couldn’t give a flying fuck about them because each time he uses the service, they either fuck the order up or it’s late.”

Nodding in agreement as we read those quotes back to him this afternoon, Joshua said that’s exactly how he feels.

Like many Australians, he’s read about the developments regarding UberEats and their nigh-on-criminal business ethics and how they’ve been referred to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) – but he says he understands were Uber is coming from.

“I really want to feel for these cyclists and restauranteurs, I really do,” he said.

“But look, if they don’t get here in time, if they get lost or if my food shows up cold, they’ve defaulted on their end of the contract,”

“That’s my opinion. Get my food here hot and on time? I’ll help you burn down city hall for better work conditions. You fuck my dinner up? You’re on your own, Jose.”

Mum Cleaning Out Son’s Room Wants To Know If He Wants The Street Sign With His Name On It

TEXT:

Collecting street signs is a favourite past time for young men across Australia, but there inevitably comes a time where house matriarchs no longer want their homes to be the storage containers for the countless street signs brought home by their intoxicated sons. For David Ridge (29), that time is now.

“Yeah, Brent, I’m just cleaning out your room at home. D’you still want your David St sign?” asked Mrs. Ridge while on the phone to her son.

“Oh nah, that’s ok thanks, mum” replied Brenton.

“Ok, and what about the stop sign, the BSW Bundy Rum price poster and the double page spread you tore out of FHM?”

“Umm nah, you can chuck all that stuff out too.”

The Advocate understands that this particular kind of petty theft is rife amongst Australian males aged between 13-23, with the Problematic Pilfering Association (PPA) reporting that an astounding 73% of Betoota Council’s yearly budget gets blown on replacing street signs around the city.

“Yes it’s just as you explain it; stop signs, street signs, even a lot of indoor caution signs – slippery when wet, for example.” Said a defeated Derek Voss, chairman at PPA.

“And there’s nothing we can do, we just have to wait until the boys mature, but even then, a new wave follows them.”

According to Derek, the PPA is in contact with the local council to try and organize some kind of decoy signs that are made at a fraction of the cost, making their theft is less significant, or even gifting 14-year-olds a sign of their choice on their birthday.

Kardashian Clan Looking To Construct Whole Sentence Out Of Their Kids’ Names

TEXT:

The birth of Khloe Kardashian’s first child has been a trending topic in Betoota’s Twittersphere since the announcement, not only because citizens are happy for Khloe’s newfound motherhood, but because of her choice of name. For those who have been living under a rock, Khloe named her daughter, True.

While some experts have been left dumbfounded as to why Khloe chose this particular adjective, sources close to the family have revealed exclusively to The Advocate that the Kardashian clan are in fact looking to construct an entire sentence out of their kids’ names.

“So, it was Kris who came up with it. She thought ‘wouldn’t it be fantastic to call your children names that confused people, like, are you asking for directions or calling your child?’” revealed an ex-makeup artist of Kris’s.

“And that’s how it began. Then one day Kim said ‘what if all our children’s names made a sentence? Wouldn’t that literally just be the best thing ever?’”

As it stands, the sentence currently reads as “True, North Chicago is really Stormi, Saint said it was just a Dream” however our source also revealed that the next child will likely be a pronoun or a verb to allow more creativity in the sentence, which Oxford University language expert, Boris Haut, agrees with.

“Every sentence needs a verb and a subject, so they’ve already covered the subject – they could take the sentence up a notch if they had a strong, versatile verb like ‘was’ or ‘are’. I’m excited to see where they take the sentence next.”

So are we, Boris, so are we.

Student Peruses Selection At Bottle-O Likes He’s Not About Rummage Through Bargain Bin

“Mmmmm… Côtes du Rhône ce soir, monsieur?” he giggled to himself.

“Nah, not tonight. I’m not in a position to fork out $20 right now. Maybe when exams are over.”

A mildly, not wildly popular second-year student at the South Betoota Polytechnic College toyed with the idea overnight of perhaps treating himself to a nice bottle of rouge – before waking up to himself.

Zachary Redlands, who last spoke to The Advocate in 2013 about his outrageous claims that he had a growth spurt at 28, ultimately left with a small but concise selection of South-East Australian red blends he picked up for $3 a bottle.

“I long for the day when I wouldn’t even cook with this glorified E10,” he said.

“But while I’m studying, I need to make concessions. I don’t want to wake up in five years thinking everything in life is grand – only to be sent a letter from the government saying I owe them $5500 in overpaid AusStudy benefits,”

“That’d be bad. However, until then, I will let my mind wander when I’m in the bottle shop. I’ll let it saunter between the grapevines of Bordeaux and Tuscany. Through the rolling green hills of Marlborough and have the gentle backbeat of a contemporary San Cisco track accompany my thoughts when they’re in Margaret River. A boy can dream, can’t he?”

Redlands also made the point that he often enjoys his wine in the company of John Player and his special cigarettes – which also eats into his liquor budget.

“Perhaps I should look into studying abroad? Christ, if only I wasn’t so painfully middle-class, I might be able to afford to go on exchange.”

Could Legalising Cannabis And Taxing It Fix The NBN? Barnaby Joyce Says ‘Whatever’

The former Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce was asked by our reporters this morning via mobile telephone if legalising could find the troubled NBN infrastructure and rollout – who which he said, “Please leave me alone, I don’t care anymore.”

Barnaby Joyce, a popular Coalition backbencher, said that it’d ‘probably help’ with the funding side of things and that ‘half the blokes planning it under Labor were probably smoking hooter when they drew up the plans for the project’, he ultimately conceded that he’s got more important things to worry about.

“Why did you blokes think to ring me about this?” he said.

“I don’t know much about the internet, I know how to send emails and read them. I can navigate my way to Miniclip and play that downhill snowboard game with the fucking Yeti thing that runs out and eats you after you’ve done a few jumps. You know what I’m talking about,”

“You blokes should call the Prime Minister or that fucking cardboard cutout of a bloke Bill Shorten. I’m just a humble backbencher now with sore knees and a constant mild thirst. Have a good one.”

The Advocate took the advice of the former Deputy Prime Minister and sent some inquiries to the Prime Minister’s Office and the leader of the Opposition’s.

As neither of them gets out of bed before noon, our reporters have yet to receive a reply.

However, we did receive a response from the Senate estimates committee, who has been crunching the numbers on the possible profits made of the legalisation of hooter.

Darcy Brown, who works for the government in some sort of capacity, said that the money generated from the sale and taxation of the devil’s lettuce could help build ‘a number of things’ around the country.

“We’d certainly have a lot more sugar to pour in our coffee,” he said.

“And yes, the money made could fix the NBN – provided we don’t have a Coalition government in that’s hellbent on spending $60bn on fighter jets that either can’t fly or catch on fire. Submarines that are louder than Angus Young’s man cave or we could give it to private schools so they can continue to turn out the absolute lowest quality people in society,”

Bunnings Employee Powers Through 5th “Nah Mate, I’m Fine” And Gives Unwanted Opinion

Miles Hanlon, a grown adult, looked up to see the fresh-faced Bunnings storeperson looking back at him.

“Yeah, mate,” he said.

Banjo smiled and began the first assault on Mr Hanlon’s personal space.

“Well, have you considered what you’re going to be doing to waterproo…”

The 56-year-old semi-retired builder interjected, telling the 19-year-old that he was fine.

Shocked by the forcefulness of the ‘Thanks, mate,” Banjo chuckled to himself and left the pentagenarian alone.

To the casual onlooker, it would’ve seemed a bit rude but what the casual onlooker wouldn’t know is that Banjo and Miles had already had three interactions that morning.

“He won’t leave me alone,” said Miles.

“That cheery little cunt doesn’t know anything about tools or home improvements. He’ll never fucking own a home, let alone work on one. Still, each time, he tries to give me some advice on what I should be doing,”

“I’ve been doing this for 40 years, I don’t need this desert spoon of a man’s opinion on retiling my downstairs shitter!”

On his way out to the checkout, the cagey Cancerian pushed his trolley up the lawnmower aisle, where he fantasised about the day when he’d finally be old and useless enough to own a ride-on mower.

From the shadows emerged Banjo.

“They say with ride-on mowers, less is more,” said Banjo.

Miles turned around slowly in utter disbelief.

“Mate, I’m fine. I don’t need any help,” offered Miles – one last time.

“Have you considered an electric mower? I know your generation is resitant to cha…”

Controlling himself and not wanting to end his day in a pair of handcuffs, Miles turned and walked to the checkouts without saying a word.

NRL Says Controversial Opinions Don’t Matter If You Can Score Tries And Keep Out Of Jail

TEXT:

Prefacing his statement, NRL CEO Todd Greenberg started by outlining that the highest point-scorer in the game’s history has never had a beer to celebrate that.

He said that it was a sport often plagued by scandal, criminal activity and many things worse.

“But above all, the game of rugby league shines through,” he said.

“We know that Israel [Folau] has some very, very spicy opinions about gay people, religion and rugby union – but we don’t live under the Taliban. You’re free to have an opinion in this country, even if it’s the wrong one. That’s what makes this nation great and to a certain extent, quite regressive.”

“But I digress. We here at the NRL don’t care about what’s in Issy’s heart, we care about that wicked step, the unGodly – sorry shouldn’t say that. The ability he has to break tackles as well as make them. He is a ticket-selling machine and Christ knows, fuck sorry, I mean everyone knows we need to sell more tickets. Israel is welcome back at the NRL at any time.”

The news comes as Folau faced heated criticism from people on the internet as well as Australian Rugby’s corporate sponsors over remarks he made about the LGBTI community.

A man of deep Mormon faith, Israel took to social media to explain that he feels that members of the gay community are going to Hell – despite it being a made up place.

This morning, David Pocock’s least-favourite Queenslander fronted the head honchos of Australian Rugby, where he offered to walk from his contract if his opinions brought the game into disrepute.

“As State of Origin is only a few short weeks away, I know, right! Jesus wept, where has this year gone? Fuck, sorry Issy. Anyway, it’d be nice to have Israel back in the Maroon jersey doing front flips and shit. That’d be really great. Cheers,” said Greenberg.

“Our number is still the same.”

Local Film-Based Photographer Stares Down Nose At The DSLR Peasants

TEXT:

“There’s just no artistry in digital photography,” he said.

“It’s so vapid and disposable. Technology is the greatest killer of creativity, you must confine yourself – limit your palate and make it a fight,”

“That’s where the best art comes from.”

You’d be forgiven for thinking that perhaps Ernest Pinochet-Kong has inhaled too many darkroom fumes if he’s sprouting opinions such as that – but as it turns out, it’s not too far from the sentiments of the wider photographic community.

Albeit rather small, the dedicated and passionate film photography community in Betoota has made it clear that they don’t consider digital photography to be photography at all.

As president of the Analogue Photographers’ Guild of Betoota, the 28-year-old Ernest told our reporters that he takes pride in making things difficult for himself, artistically-speaking.

“A photo is shot in the field but it is made in the darkroom,” he said.

“A digital camera takes away that element. It means any Tom, Dick or Harry with a DSLR and a MacBook can call themselves a photographer. Well, I’ve got news for you. You are a blight on the profession and you shouldn’t call yourselves photographers!”

“Seriously, though.”

Despite his attempts to gatekeep the profession, a number of digital-camera-owning-photographers have hit back at the tertiary-educated ‘image maker’ – one even going as far as to label Pinochet-Kong a ‘fuck head’.

Gary Pooley, who bought a Canon 5D to take nice pictures of his new child and pet Labrador, said that he weeps for the future of the country if this is what young people care about in this day and age.

He spoke to The Advocate briefly while he played fetch with his dog down by the Sailing Club.

“They’re just photos, mate,” he said.

“I email them to my Mum in Brisbane, I’m not fucking Ansel Adams. Unlike this little spoon in the beret, I actually remember using film cameras when they were the only thing available. And guess what? They sucked and were a giant pain in the arse,”

“Digital cameras take better pictures, they are easier and ultimately cheaper in the long run. If you don’t agree with me, then fucking run at me… seriously, though.”

🎩’s Leather Jacket Makes Fresh Appearance In Last-Ditch Effort To Prevent Spill

TEXT:

The Prime Minister used a hot cloth this morning to wipe the mould off this famous leather jacket in a last-ditch effort to prevent an almost unpreventable leadership spill this week.

Though nobody is expected to stand against Malcolm Turnbull should a spill be called from the backbench, the reemergence of the jacket has some commentators feeling this might spell the end.

But the Member for Wentworth has dispelled the notion, telling journalists this morning in Sydney that he felt a chill in the air this morning and simply reached for an old favourite.

“Ah yes,” he said as an ABC journalist in boardshorts and no shirt held his phone by his head.

“Glad to see you’ve noticed the leather jacket, it’s one of my autumn staples. But back to the issue at hand, the 30 Newspoll business is regrettable but not indicative that this government is in trouble. The fact remains that I’m the best leader the LNP has and a far more palatable alternative to William Shorten,”

“However, I urge voters to remember why they saw me as an alternative to begin with. Remember the leather jacket, remember me schooling Tony Jones repeatedly on live national television. Remember me as the self-made millionaire with a proven track record of fiscal responsibility.”

Local LNP voters, however, told The Advocate that the leather jacket is a distant memory and just because he’s wearing it again doesn’t mean they’ll vote for him again.

“I’d consider it,” said one small business owner.

“Then again, I’ve got as much faith in the political system in this country as I do in a Michael Clarke return to the Test arena,”

“I’d vote for Albo, though.”

“At Least It’s Better Than MKR”: Local Man Praises Arrival Of Commonwealth Sports Carnival

TEXT:

The opening ceremony of the hotly-anticipated Commonwealth Sports Carnival received a double thumbs up from a local father, who says he’s just happy to have some more sports to watch.

That – and it’s booted My Kitchen Rules off the airways for two weeks.

Stanley Parsons, a bank manager at the Diamantina Loan and Savings Co-Op on Morris Street, said that he was often relegated to the small TV he has in his garden shed of an evening time.

But not for the next couple weeks.

“If I wanted to watch the Lions or the Cowboys, I’d have to go out in the shed,” he said.

“My wife and kids would hog the plasma in the living room from the start of the Imparja news hour to nigh on bloody midnight most nights. I’d be lucky if I could slither back in and stretch out in front of a U-Boat documentary in the wee hours,”

“But now the boot is on the other foot. It’s just like the Winter Olympics all over again.”

Stan’s sentiments were not echoed by his wife, Janie, who told our reporters that she’s not particularly impressed with her favourite cooking show being left on the sidelines.

Taking time out of her busy Thursday morning to speak to The Advocate, the mother-of-two said she didn’t know why Network Seven bother to have ‘four or five’ other channels if they’re not even going to use them.

“They’re playing a fucking Storage Wars marathon today or Seven Mate. Can’t you just put MKR on that channel?” she said.

“And they ended it on a cliffhanger as well. I’m livid! Honestly, the ads aren’t helping either. Someone gets booted off and apparently, someone has a swing at Manu. I’ll tell you what, by the time it’s back on the air, I’ll be ready to rip Pete’s stupid sideburns off his stupid head!”

“I’ve had to suffer through the cricket, the Winter Olympics and a resurgent Broncos outfit. Now I’ve got to suffer through the Commonwealth Games? It hardly seems fair.”

Cameron Bancroft Returns To Former Job Playing The Kazoo In Tame Impala

TEXT:

Aside from spending time in the nets both here in Australia and overseas, former Test opener Cameron Bancroft is also returning to his former role as the kazoo player in the popular Fremantle band, Tame Impala.

It was noted by a number of music journalists when Bancroft’s departed the project in 2011 to focus on his budding cricket career, Tame Impala’s sound noticeably changed from a traditional psychedelic jam band to a more vaporwave Beach Boys type of vibe.

The reasoning behind this, according to the band’s bedroom composer Kevin Parker, is because the band lost the most talented kazoo player to emerge from Western Australia in recent memory.

“Yeah,” said Parker.

“We were pretty kazoo-heavy those days. Some nights, we used to let Cameron solo for like 20 minutes. It was a crazy time. The mining boom, the jetski boom. Troy Buswell was still our treasurer. I miss those days sometimes, other times, I don’t,”

“Anyway, my liege, it’s nice to have Bancroft back for a few months. We’re going to have a bit of a lock-in this weekend and kazoo out. Who knows, we might even get Ben Cousins over to play the theremin. Why the hell not?”

Bancroft was equally as excited when he spoke to our reporter briefly this morning, outlining that music is the outlet he needs at the moment – before heading over to England to spend time with the swinging Dukes nut.

“It should be good, there’s something great about being from Perth and coming home to Perth,” he said.

“Mum kept all my kazoos, too. I was worried they might’ve been chucked out. I’m a bit rusty, had a bit of a blow last night and it’s all coming back to me. Looking forward to heading south over the Fremantle Traffic Bridge with the top down and the wind blowing through my hair,”

“But yeah, I’ll do this for a few months, then I’ll get back in the nets so I can come back into the team and score some runs for the fans.”

Mixed Touch Winger Swoons As Peacocking Investment Banker Burns Her Down The Sideline

TEXT:

A local man with a distinct inability to interpret social cues, and gnawing insecurities, has finally managed to woo a member of the opposite sex this week.

Justin Masters (32) a banker from the Ponds, managed to achieve the feat during his weekly social mixed touch game by stepping on the outside of the woman defending him on the wing and using his pace to leave her in his tracks down the sideline.

Georgia Crowe (25) told The Advocate that she was absolutely bowled over by Robertson’s display of athletic prowess.

“That was incredibly attractive. The way he used his physical superiority and speed to run around me in our reasonably relaxed social mixed touch comp, was certainly arousing,” she said.

However, unlike Crowe, no one else on her team was particularly impressed by what is generally regarded as a bit of a faux pas.

Indigo Camp (24), a team member who shouted; “Oh yeah, well-done champ, real good” as Robertson sped off down the sideline, explained to our reporters that it’s considered a bit of a no-no for blokes to burn girls on the sidelines.

“It’s social, mixed, touch. You just don’t do it. Fair enough through the middle or running a line on the fringes, but the speed on the outside thing just isn’t cricket. Old mate can jog on,” she said.

“I think the best thing to do when something like that happens is to clap loudly and congratulate them in an aggressive manner.”

We questioned about the event Masters informed us that he couldn’t care less about the faux pas.

“They are probably the same people crowing about equal rights and gender equality. I’m showing my support for gender equality by sprinting past her like I would (if I could) to a man,” he said.

Hopes For Draw In Joburg Fade As Chinese Space Station Fails To Crash Into Stadium

TEXT:

Australia’s hopes of securing a draw in the fourth Test seem to have all but disappeared this afternoon local time as the Chinese space station Tiangong-1 failed to land on The Wanders stadium in Johannesburg overnight.

It was hoped that the falling space junk would crash into the sporting complex, effectively ruling play out for some years – meaning the current Test match would’ve ended in a draw.

“It’s disappointing,” said Australian captain Tim Paine.

“We were really holding out for Tiangong to come through for us. But I just got word it landed somewhere in the South Pacific. What a got dam [sic] waste,”

“Oh well. We’ll just have to plug on and hope it rains. Vale Tiangong.”

Paine’s sentiments were echoed by a number of personalities in Australian cricket.

One more vocal and colourful voice was Rob Quiney, who admitted he just returned from an extended trip to Fiji and was just learning about the ball-tampering saga in the hours leading to lunch today.

“Oh wow,” he said.

“Yeah. The boys are getting whipped over there. It would’ve done them a world of good if that Chinese space house hit Wanderers. There’s no coming back for 400 behind when all you want to do it pack up your kit and go sit on a beach for a few weeks,”

“Which is what I’ve been doing. Oi but, can you plug my book in your newspaper? It’s called My Two Tests and it’s a grouse read. Foreword by Ed Cowan. It’s on sale now. Cheers, boorie.”

XXXX Gold Hurt By News David Warner Was Drinking Champagne During Hotel Bar Meltdown

TEXT:

Cricket Australia welcomed back XXXX GOLD as it’s official beer partner at the start of the season, taking over from the incumbent Victoria Bitter.

The Men and Women From Milton rejoiced at the news – finally, the nation’s most popular midstrength beer was back supporting Australia’s most popular sporting team.

“Everything was going along fine,” said one senior executive from Castlemaine Perkins.

“Until yesterday.”

The ball-tampering scandal has not only hit the sport hard, it’s also hurt a number of commercial partners that aligned themselves with the team.

“When we heard David Warner was having a few drinks in the hotel bar with his non-cricket friends, we thought he deserved to blow off a bit of steam. There’s been a lot of pressure on him and if there’s anyone who needs a cold, refreshing XXXX Gold, it’s David Warner,”

“But we were so hurt, so disappointed when the news filtered down that he was drinking champagne. Not even sparkling white – but the actually French stuff. As the official beer partner of the Australian cricket team, we’d like to express our horror at the news.”

The executive went onto explain that sometimes people need a heavier drink, which is why they still make XXXX Bitter.

“Perhaps he would’ve enjoyed a bitter? We’re in talks with Cricket Australia to make sure the team has access to heavy beer as well. High-carb and his ABV. Sometimes you just need it.”

Darren Lehmann Retires To Jamaican Village And Waits For Opportunity To Coach Bobsled Team

TEXT:

Darren Lehmann, the former coach of the Australian Men’s Cricket Team, has hinted at a possible next career move by telling reporters that he plans to move to Jamaica and wait for the opportunity to coach their national bobsled team.

In a selfless act of redemption, the barnstorming South Australian said he’s looking forward to being tapped on the shoulder when the four-man bobsled training resumes on the Caribbean island next year.

“I’ve got Beijing 2022 in my sights,” said Lehmann at a Cape Town press conference.

“Right now, moving to relative obscurity in Jamaica is probably the best thing I can do. I plan to float around for a while, maybe shoot the shit with a few mates I’ve got there, then find a nice bar and wait for a group of sprinters to ask me to coach them in the bobsled,”

“I’ve seen it done before and the island lifestyle suits me. It’s either that or move back to Adelaide. Moving to Kangaroo Island isn’t that appealing unless you like shooting feral cats and seafood. No, Jamaica is calling my name.”

Supporting the move, Cricket Australia CEO James Sutherland followed Boof at the press conference by bidding the 48-year-old bon voyage and good luck in his future endeavours as a bobsled coach.

Sutherland prefaced his statement by agreeing with a number of journalists in saying it was ‘bizarre’ and ‘odd’ that Lehmann has turned to coaching a winter Olympic sport – but he remains supportive none the less.

“I think it’d be good for him to have some time off,” he said.

“Have a few cocktails, do some snorkelling. I wasn’t aware Darren had expertise in bobsled. Perhaps he could’ve been put to better use coaching the Australian team,”

“Anyway, Australia is losing a great cricketing and bobsledding mind and we here at Cricket Australia hope it turns out well for him.”

Government Official Nervously Serves Deportation Notice At Russian Embassy

TEXT:

An unlucky junior employee from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trading (DFAT) was chosen to deliver the Notice of Deportation papers to the Russian Embassy in Canberra this afternoon – which he did so in a regular Army gas mask.

Peter Gollan, the public servant forced to make the short walk up the garden path to the embassy door, told our reporters that he was “terrified” and “concerned for his own safety” after being told he was the man for the job.

“My boss called me in and said he had ‘good news’ for me,” he said.

“Shortly after he said that, he threw me a gas mask and manilla folder of papers and told me a car was waiting for me out the front. I didn’t know if the gas mask would even work if I got szvitzed in the face with whatever that shit is they’ve been szvitzing people with,”

“Anyway, it all went off without a hitch and they were actually pretty nice about it. They laughed at my mask and took a photo of me. All’s well that ends well, right?”

The Advocate reached out to the Russian Embassy via email for comment but before our reporter could push send, a well-thought-out and polite email from the Russians arrived in our inbox.

Putin’s representative in Australia assured The Advocate and our readers that no Australian should fear visiting the Russian Embassy and that if you don’t attempt to sell their state secrets, there’s little to no danger of being spray with a powerful nerve agent.

“Why Should My Taxes Go To Centrelink?” Says Generation Who Invented Franking Credits

TEXT:

Whenever Julie and Peter Rovemount head up over the hill from the Old City District where they live to where they’ve bought their son a ‘starter home’ in Betoota Ponds, they lock the doors to their late-model Volvo and try not to make eye contact with anyone.

They avoid Mulholland Street at all costs.

“It’s shocking out here but it’s slowly being gentrified, which is why we made the purchase in the first place,” said Julie.

“Yes, it’ll prove to be a real cash cow. Once they close down the housing commission down the road and ship them all off to the Betoota City Limits. The Centrelink office attracts a lot of trouble.”

“That whole welfare department is a huge drain on the economy. People should work for their money,” added Peter.

“I worked for everything I have. Why can’t everybody else?”

However, a recent study published by the Betoota Member’s Credit Union has outlined that ‘franking credits’ and other tax concessions for ageing people cost the local economy much more than unemployment and disability benefits.

When our reporter put that to Mr and Mrs Rovemount, Peter explained to our young reporter that he didn’t understand what he was talking about.

Julie also took the time to explain to The Advocate that they’ve worked for their small fortune and by comparison, they’re not as wealthy as some of their other friends at the Betoota Grove Country Club.

“How dare you say that,” she said before Peter interjected.

“Listen, boy. You don’t know what you’re talking about. We built this country. Why should I have to pay tax twice on my earnings? The bank pays their tax, why should I? This is why I weep for the future of my country,”

“And people wonder why newspapers are closing and journalists are getting made redundant. Just write what people want to hear and maybe you could support a family one day, you piece of shit.”

“Let’s Go Camping This Weekend” Says Mate Who Has Lost Track Of What Is And Isn’t Fun

TEXT:

The final nail has been driven into the coffin of a long-standing friendship of individuals in their mid-thirties, as the least accomplished of the group, Shannon Matheson (35), suggested on the group chat “Let’s go camping.”

The group chat in question features eight high school friends, who sparsely make loose plans to catch up for a drink, share the odd baby photo and make jokes about the last time they were all together over ten years ago.

It was during one lighthearted assertion that it’s “bin 2 long” since they’d all seen each other that Matheson took a bold and uncalculated leap of faith and suggested they should spend a weekend of their life camping together.

After being ‘seen’ by no less than three group chat members, Jonathan Hooper (36) was the first to make it clear this idealistic dream was never going to happen.

“Can’t mate, need my sleep apnea machine most nights these days.”

From there it has been reported the excuses from fellow group-chaters increased at an alarming rate.

“I usually need to help with the kid’s sport most weekends mate.”

“Don’t think I’d be able to get the time off.”

“Haha, nup.”

Disappointed in his friend’s commitment to adulthood, Matheson proceeded to spend his week binge drinking every evening, a change in his routine of binge drinking every weekend.

“It’s fucked they all have shit to do with their wives and their kids, can’t even make time to sink piss in a national park with me. Thought we were mates?”

Matheson claims he is going to find new friends, despite living in a country town where he already knows everyone his age and as a 35-year-old man in the 21st century, has no real way of meeting new people.

Concerned about Matheson’s wellbeing, Hooper hopes his pal is able to keep himself together without needing to resort to spending a night in a tent with a group of men who have outgrown him.

“I still want him in my life sure. I want him to meet my kids so they can see what happens if you spend year 12 trying to get drunk all the time.”

Young Professional’s Collection Of Books Consists Entirely Of Unread Penguin Classics

TEXT:

Flicking through the latest edition of GQ magazine, a popular French Quarter advertising account manager spied an article that described what females allegedly like seeing in a man’s house.

What Konrad Randrup, a first generation Danish-Australian, read in that article chilled him to his very core.

“It said that girls like men who read,” he said.

“Which presented a problem because I didn’t have any books. There were a lot of other things in that article like getting into shape or having a good sense of humour but they take a lot of time and hard work to improve,”

“Getting some books was something I could fix immediaetly and with very little effort. So I stopped by my local independent bookshop and pulled some nice looking ones off the shelf and handed the prick behind the counter my credit card and we’re away.”

Our reporter asked Mr Randrup if he places to read any of the books, to which he laughed and said no.

He told The Advocate that he was only reading that issue of GQ in the first place because he was in a dentist waiting room.

“Turns out it was a GQ from 2007 [laughs] Hope the advice was timeless! I’ll let you know how I go, mate.”

In the interests of balance, the director of sales here at The Advocate, Rachael Frost, was quizzed about the validity of the GQ article’s substance and the conclusions drawn from it by Mr Randrup.

“Please don’t annoy me with this garbage journalism,” she said.

“But to answer your question, just so you’ll leave, I don’t give a shit.”

“Living Standards Won’t Improve Until All The Baby Boomers Are Dead” Says Reserve Bank

TEXT:

A controversial comment from the Reserve Bank today has a lot of hard-working senior Australians up in arms over claims the nation would be better off if they all just died.

Philip Lowe, Governor of the Reserve Bank Of Australia, made the comments this afternoon during a presentation to shareholders and investors in Sydney.

“Young people want fast internet, higher wages, affordable housing and some tangible career prospects. Unreasonable, I know,” he said.

“Our research indicates none of those things will happen until the Baby Boomers are all dead,”

“They won’t happen because these things cost money and the money needs to come from the people who’ve spent a lifetime hoarding it. So by that rationale, we can’t see living conditions improve until at least 2040.”

The statement has outraged a prominent outspoken Betoota Grove Baby Boomer, who lashed out at the suggestion that the nation would be better off if he was dead.

Dennis Peters told our reporters that the young people of Australia need to be more thankful for the utopia his generation has made for the Gen X population and the Millennials.

“So you want me to keel over and die. Give all my money to my kids to get a start in life? I don’t have any money!”

“I’m sick of hearing it. The Baby Boomers did the thankless job of building a nice, safe place for our kids to live. Will the country be better if all the broke Baby Boomers die as well?”

Yes, according to the Reserve Bank.

“They will clog up the public health system. We could be building cool things like bullet trains and bullet internet. Instead, most of the budget will go to old age pensions and the related health care,”

“Our advice is to hold tight if you’re a young Australian. When your parents are dead, you will finally get the things you feel entitled to.”

Facebook Assures Australians They’d Sell Their Data If It Wasn’t Just Shitposting About The NBN

TEXT:

Facebook has responded to claims they’ve been selling the data of Australian users by outlining that most of the content and information Australians put on Facebook is ‘inherently worthless’.

The popular social media network told The Advocate a short time ago that everything that Australians put on Facebook is garbage and the data harvested from their local customers isn’t worth anything to anyone.

“Beleive me, we’ve tried,” said Barry Gollan, who’s the new head down at Facebook Australia’s offices in Betootacone Valley.

“One disgruntled employee put a big wedge of data on an external hard drive last year and went down to Cash Converters to try and sell it. They offered him six points of heroin and an unregistered snub-nose .38 for it,”

“A good deal if you ask me, he should’ve taken it but at the end of the day, I’m glad [Cash] Converters phoned the police. We could’ve got in a lot of trouble if that data got out.”

Mr Gollan then went on to explain that nearly all the data they’ve collected so far is just ‘shitposts about the NBN being sub-standard’ and people liking posts about reality television.

“There’s no meat to it. Australians don’t even protest. The two major parties are so alike, elections almost seem unnecessary. That’s why the data of Australian internet users isn’t worth the disk space it occupies.”

The Advocate reached out to Cambridge Analytica, the firm at the centre of the Facebook data harvesting scandal in the US, but arrived to find their Australian offices alight.

Four employees of the firm were pulled from the building alive with two small calibre bullet wounds to the back of their skulls each and their fingerprints were burnt off as well.

They’re currently receiving care at the Daroo Street General Practitioner Outpatient Facility.

Landscaper Has Too Much Respect For The Hoselink Man To Use His Special Hose For Bong

TEXT:

Dustin ‘Dusty’ Russo (32) doesn’t mind winding down after a long day landscaping with a cheeky cone before the homeowners return but today decided against helping himself to four inches of their garden hose, upon discovering it was a patented Hoselink system.

Not averse to making a bong using a bit of a client’s hose, often using their own secateurs to do so, Russo claims the entrepreneurial spirit that drives Hoselink turned him off modifying the product.

“I thought about that old fella in the ads and he’s a battler just like me you know? I wouldn’t be able to look him in the eyes again if I pinched a bit of hose from him.”

Hoselink is an Australian gardening supplies company who rose to popularity due to their innovative adverts featuring the CEO and his family talking about how good they reckon their products are.

Strong in the belief a bit or marijuana is the perfect way to celebrate completing a six-day job in just eight days, it was the memory Hoselink founder Tim Kierath’s reassuring smile that turned Russo off helping himself to a length of his client’s Hoselink hose.

Russo claims this was not an easy decision to make, considering he already had an empty bottle of Maximus ready, as well as a cone piece he constructed out of the foil that contained his peanut butter sandwich earlier that day.

Here’s why dad jokes might be problematic.

TEXT:

We’ve all heard these before:

“Hi Hungry, I’m dad!”

“What jam can’t you eat? A traffic jam!”

“I make apocalypse jokes like there’s no tomorrow!”

Chances are if you grew up with a father capable of human speech or had friends with a likewise male presence you’ve encountered a ‘dad joke’ before.

On the surface, dad jokes are a non-threatening wordplay or one-liner, enjoyed for the reason that it is largely unfunny but can be shared innocently by any man who has pro-created.

This, however, might not be as innocent as we all think, because when you scratch just a little beneath the surface you can begin to see that dad jokes might be more problematic than you originally thought.

1. It perpetuates the idea that we have to laugh at men in a position of power.

Growing up, when you hear a dad joke, either from your own dad or a father of a friend, it is usually when they are in a position of power such as giving you a lift or having you over for dinner.

Usually, these men are already the literal patriarch of the family and expecting others to laugh at a joke that is deliberately unfunny abuses the power they have over you.

Even if the idea that a ‘hot chocolate’ might sometimes want to be called ‘beautiful chocolate’ is kind of funny, it’s also low key sexist and v racist when you think about it.

2. It exemplifies male privilege.

As we mentioned before, dad jokes are made with the exception of forced laughter, despite the knowledge by both joke teller and audience that the humour lies in the joke being unfunny.

When these jokes are told by a dad, usually a cis male (ew), it not only perpetuates the idea that men do not have to work as hard as women to get what they want, it’s an actual real example of it happening.

Telling these jokes in front of your children can grow this idea that men should expect results no matter how much effort they commit to something, even if dad’s “joke about the unemployed hardly ever works!”

3. It’s unfair to women.

Close your eyes and try to think of a mum joke. You can’t.

There’s no denying mum jokes exist and while they differ from dad jokes in the way that there is more effort put behind them, they usually don’t have a punchline and are often about something they saw on TV, there’s no denying they don’t really get the response they deserve.

“I went to a cafe the other day and said ‘Large mug of latte please.’ The girl brings it over and I say ‘Hang on, this is a small, I ordered a large,’ and she said ‘Are you sure?’ and I said ‘Of course I’m not sure! I haven’t had my coffee yet!’”

While dad jokes seem to be celebrated and laughed at for their effort alone, mum jokes are treated as some horrible thing that mothers do just to embarrass us and while most dads will try and be funny, there is usually only one ‘funny mum’ in the gang who is generally treated as an outcast.

This is a problem guys.

While dad jokes seem to celebrate a man’s ability to be funny while not even trying, mum jokes shame women for trying to compete with their parental counterparts.

It continues to grow the unfair idea that women aren’t as funny as men which is why female comedians like Amy Schumer and Sarah Silverman get categorised as ‘comics instead of ‘comedians’ and Dave Chappelle gets categorised as the funniest cunt in the world.

So what can you do?

Next time you here a dad making dad jokes simply react as you would if a woman was telling the joke.

If it is funny, laugh.

If it’s not, begin a discourse about the possibly damaging implications of dad jokes and promise to link them to this article later instead of actually doing the arguing yourself.

If that doesn’t work perhaps you should just make like a tree and leave, so to say.

He lists himself on twitter as a thoughtmaker and journalist, despite only getting published in online publications like this one when we are running low on sponsored content. 

Louis credits his love of dissecting the news, and using political correctness to crucify any writer/actor/comic that is doing better than him, to a gap year spent building poorly designed mud huts in a third world country with a school-counsellor-suggested charity that has since been shut down due to revelations that 90% of donations were spent on useless cunts like him.

With a relatively big twitter following and an elite education at both an inner-city selective school and a demountable arts department in a prominent Sandstone University, Louis relishes in the fact that at 23, he is much more engaged with problematic societal trends that he never looked twice at a couple years ago when he was still going to NRL matches with his dad.

Report Finds Only 2% Of After-School Fights Actually Worth Sprinting To After 3PM Bell

TEXT:

A recent report has found that despite the amount of shit talk that gets spread around school after lunch, very few after school fights are actually worth missing the bus home for.

A recent report commissioned by the ASSAD Organisation (After School Sledging And Dipping) indicates that in the average Australians whole schooling life, they will usually only see one or two fights worth remembering.

Survey data finds that only 1 in 20 will actually see a punch thrown, and only 1 in 50 will result in any blood.

“The bloodlust of the indifferent high schooler standing around the fight is very rarely satisfied” said lead researcher, Ava Blue.

The most common cause of a high school dip was found to be a hot chick named Rachel who actually isn’t going out with either of them, but even it that scenario the after school melee is more about Rachel yelling for them to stop, and looking popular.

“This comes down to the fact that there usually is only 6 or 7 testosterone charged alphas that are competent in the areas of stinking in any year group, and they usually are in the same social group” said Mrs Blue

“Unless there is some cross-football-code-circle rivalries, very few at-risk young men are willing to challenge the Animal Kingdom by punching on with older kids”

The report also found that the intuition of career high school teachers often gets in the way of a good stink, as it increases the likelihood of a veteran PE teacher called Mr Illich rocking up and letting out a massive ‘oi’ before anyone even throws one.

Hipster Lying In Bed With Overheating Laptop On Chest Proudly Declares He Doesn’t Own A TV

TEXT:

A Melbourne man, who watches upwards of 30 hours of Netflix on his laptop each week, has again found an opportunity to declare that he does not own a television.

Lincoln Beattie, a white-collar worker originally from Ascot in Brisbane’s inner-north, made the declaration to his stylist during his weekly dreadlock maintenance in Fitzroy.

The opportunity arose when the stylist asked him something about the latest episode of I’m a Celebrity, Get Me Outta Here. “I was just like ‘nah bro, there’s no television in my apartment bro. I prefer the real world’” Lincoln said.

“I think he felt pretty inferior after that and rightly so. It’s mind poison bro”.

Laying in his bed at 11:30pm, the fan in his Mac book audibly failing to do its job, Beattie breathed a huge sigh after temporarily losing wifi connection.

“Absolutely not” he said.

“I’m Not That Into Politics” Says Man Who Only Faces Adversity On A Golf Course

TEXT:

Dennis Gregory, of Betoota Grove, told The Advocate this afternoon that despite appearances, there are times when he feels like Sisyphus.

But the boulder he pushes up the hill of life is smaller, by his own admission, that nearly everybody else in town.

According to modern standards, he’s genetically gifted.

His strong frame, topped a cool blonde faux-hawk are only the start of a long list of birth-privileges that make not caring at all about politics possible.

“I ask Dad who I should vote for on like the day and then I go do it because I don’t want to get fined,” he giggled from a plush living room couch within the second living room of his parent’s 6-bedroom home.

“All they do is just shout and scream at each other, they don’t even get anything done. It’s just so boring and self-absorbed. Um, how about you actually do something?”

“So yeah, I’m not really into politics. I love to travel, though. Golf is also fun. Me and my friends from Whooton [a publically-funded local private school] play golf three times a week. But when Jon plays with us on Sunday, we have to play on the public course, which is way easier.”

Dennis’ blase attitude toward the politic discourse has drawn the ire of one former employee at the Royal Betoota Golf Club.

Whisper Nightpony, who was not placed in the same manger of life Dennis was, worked at the exclusive golf club for a number of years and told our reporter what she thinks of the full-time-stay-at-home-son.

“I think he’s a cunt,” she said.

“This one time I remember, he ordered five Long Island Ice Teas, which are a pain in the arse to make and I had to run down the cellar to get more dark rum. When I got back and made them, I jokingly said how hard they were to make properly,”

“Then he said, ‘Try maintaining a handicap of 23 with a set of hire clubs, baby,’ and then frisbeed his Amex card. So I did what any other normal person did. I snapped it in half then walked out.”

LIFEHACK: Pour Talcum Powder On Hair To Distract People From Your Poor Personal Hygiene

TEXT:

It’s Sunday evenig and Betoota Grove woman, Grace Springwater (27), is contemplating whether or not she should wash her hair before going in to work tomorrow.

While it may seem like a simple and easy decision to make, for Grace, there’s much more thought that needs to go into it.

“Ugh. If I wash it today, then by Saturday it won’t be clean for lunch with the girls”

“And it’s such a hassle, can you see how much hair I have? Not only do I have to wash it, but I have to dry it – that process takes at least 1.5 hours!”

But there is a trick, or a lifehack as our editor calls it.

Talcum powder is made up of talc, a clay mineral composed of hydrated magnesium silicate with the chemical formula H₂Mg₃(SiO₃)₄ or Mg₃Si₄O₁₀(OH)₂. In loose form, it’s most commonly known as baby powder, but in the world of the lazy hair-washer, it’s a lifeline. 

“You just sprinkle a little bit on your hair – shit! Too much came out”

“Ok so yeah, little bit in the hair. Then you kind of just pat your head and ruffle your hair until it’s more or less gone”

“Voila!” 

Grace presented her now marginally less greasy hair to our reporter, who gave her a nervous smile before bidding her farewell.

The Advocate understands that the chalky discolouration of one’s hair is the price you have to pay if you can’t be bothered to wash you hair.

Tradie Says He Actually Did Buy A Ute For The Sole Purpose Of Helping Mates Move House

TEXT:

Though the clutch in his Proton Jumbuck slips more than a drunk on rollerskates, Dennis Peterson, of Betoota Ponds fame, is more than happy to give his mates a hand moving shit.

He says it’s the sole purpose he got a ute in the first place.

“A station wagon would be just as useful to me,” said the popular electrician.

“But I got the ute because I wanted all my mates to ring me up when they wanted to move something. Sometimes they even ask me to help them move something myself physically like I don’t have anything better to do,”

“So when the phone rings, I fire up the old Malaysian billycart and I’m off in a cloud of blue smoke.”

The 26-year-old told The Advocate he helped a mate move house yesterday – and expected nothing in return.

Friends of Dennis say they’ve all used his ute at some point in the past couple years and told our reporter that he never accepts payment or even beer for his efforts.

Max Dupont, who’s a former classmate of Peterson’s, said he moved house with the help of Dennis late last year.

“I know mates who own utes have their piss taken on the reg,” he said.

“But Den, even though a Proton Jumbuck is a ute for children, is also so accommodating, it’s almost like he doesn’t care about having to throw people the keys to it every weekend,”

“But yeah, he’s real hard on that ute. The tyres a balder than Kevin Rudd’s right arse cheek and it rattles like a Queenslander’s mouth in Thredbo. We’re convinced he’s trying to kill it so he doesn’t have to keep lending it out to people.”

Local Dad Hoping Inferior Dad Next Door Heard Him Start Mower In One Pull

TEXT:

A sunny afternoon just got a little brighter for local dad Wayne Crocker (48), as he started his lawnmower in just one pull, and is pretty confident the inferior man next door saw him do it.

“Was he looking? He was? Haha, classic.”

Usually a fan of besting his neighbour, Arnie Dale (35), in other ways such as extravagant Christmas decorations and having a bigger BBQ, Crocker made sure to wait for Dale to step outside before starting his lawnmower in a single stroke.

“Got him! Don’t even really need to mow!”

Crocker also used this opportunity to advise Dale on his exceptional mowing skills, pointing to his ability to mow easily beneath the trampoline and the immaculate edges he cut that separate the two properties to the millimetre.

“Yeah, you can borrow this one once I’m done if you like? I hear you’re still on a Parklander! This ought to do the trick a bit better. Here come try it out.”

Upon showing Dale the intricate pull-string method that starts his mower, he found himself becoming slightly aroused as his less masculine neighbour took two pulls to start the engine.

“Did you see that? Bet you he didn’t get his license on the first go either! Probably drives auto!”

From there, Crocker proceeded to show him the ease with which his ‘Honda HRU196M1 Buffalo Classic’ can handle rough terrain by mowing Dale’s front lawn.

“You don’t mind me cutting your grass do you Arnie! Haha!”

Speaking privately with The Advocate, Arnie Dale shared with us his thoughts on his neighbour’s dazzling lawnmower skills.

“One stroke every time? How does he do it? Fucking hell.”

Local Sharehouse Turned Upside Down Looking For Phantom Pack Of Cigarettes

TEXT:

It’s three in the morning and one local real estate agent laughs and says he’ll sort it out later.

As the reasonable hours wind down at Gary Breman’s Old City District terrace, it becomes apparent that later is right now.

“I’m going to run up and down the stairs for an hour,” he said.

“That should help me find everything. But in particular, I’m looking for that fresh deck I got this afternoon before work,”

“I refuse to believe that I left it behind and I also reject the notion that I left it behind at home or at the day-time-hour pub we went to after work. I will find them, even if it costs me my sanity.”

Making short work of what’s left of his sanity, Gary enlisted the help of all the quiet young men and women who’ve materialised in his Rue du Lapin two-bedder.

“Don’t just stand there,” he said.

“They are John Player Specials. An olive pack and a whole heap of warning labels. I’d never advocate smoking, it will kill you slowly and painfully, but I’d burn down half of Europe to find my durries,”

“Can I borrow one?”

“Get That Winter Body You Want”: Fast Food Outlets Begin Advertising Body Transformation Deals

TEXT:

“I told myself this year that I’d make a change,” he said.

“And by God, I’m going to do it.”

After a long summer of running up and down stairs, lifting heavy things and being social, Greg Franklin is sick and tired of feeling fantastic.

This year, the 29-year-old is hellbent on getting the winter body he’s always wanted.

He knows it’s going to take hard work and determination.

Long, lonely nights at home suffering through one emotional eating binge after another.

But he’s not alone.

Many local fast food restaurants are committed to supporting people like Greg in their journey to harm themselves physically and emotionally.

One of the first franchises to throw the moody Scorpio a lifesaver was the Betoota Ponds Dominos, who’ve made it easy for Greg to begin his quest for a banging winter body by filling his letterbox with coupons.

“They sent me deals where I can get three pizzas, a coke and some garlic bread all for like $25. I don’t even need to leave the house or interact with another human. I just leave a note on the door to leave it and go away,” he said.

“Perfect. There’s like 4000 calories or something in all that shit. I’ll have that winter body before Winter even gets here at this rate.”

Just when he thought the bargains wouldn’t stop coming, he received some coupons from a popular flavoured milk brank – one made famous for busting more lapbands than any other.

Their lawyers have prevented us named them, for now.

“When I was watching my weight and keeping fit, I would’ve rather had a glass of a stranger’s first piss of the day than have a chocolate milk,” he said.

“Now, they’re my partner on a great and noble quest to the land of Dad bod.”

Channel 10 To Air New Show About People Watching Gogglebox Stoned

TEXT:

Channel 10, in an effort to remain on top of the pile of networks who specialise in shows about people not really doing anything, has announced that they will soon begin airing a show about people in their homes watching episodes of the hit TV series Gogglebox, whilst ripping cones.

A spokesperson for the network explained: “We’re looking into the future with more shows like this absolute doozy” she said. “the savings on production costs like set design, scripts, costume…basically everything, has really helped stretch out our own careers as media tycoons a bit longer”.

The show will feature people from all walks of life, across a wide area of Hervey Bay, whom possess a moderate-to-severe weed habit.

Gogglebongs (working-title) aims to restore the networks credibility as a broadcaster of high quality programming, as the shows subjects smash billies on the couch and draw graffiti on the coffee table, whilst Gogglebox plays on the TV and Dr Dre’s 2001 plays on the hi-fi system.

“We don’t anticipate them making too many comments on the show” the spokesperson said. “In fact, we don’t anticipate them saying much at all. It will be lots of staring really, with a few trips back and forth from the kitchen, a fair bit of Milo and the occasional moment of mild panic”.

Di Natale Blows Dust Off Bob Brown’s Communist-Era AK47 After Christensen Death Threats

TEXT:

“Does he think this is a game?” asked Richard Di Natale as he fed bullets into a magazine.

“When the purge comes, he’ll be hanging from a street light. We’re done playing around with this guy, if he wants to get real with us, we’ll get real with him.”

The Greens leader has his predecessor Bob Brown’s Communist-era AK47 across his lap has he speaks to us.

He tells us a story of how Bob used it back in the day on the Franklin and Huon rivers down in Tasmania.

“If this thing could talk,” he says, loading a magazine into it before reefing back on the charging handle.

“Before Bob got hold of it, it was in Cuba and South America. It’s probably popped more heads than George has popped Corona bottles. I won’t be wearing those pussy earbuds when I let this thing ring out, too.”

Di Natale is referring to his Lower House colleague George Christensen, who made an idle death threat against ‘greenies’ over the weekend in a touching Facebook post.

The post showed the Queensland MP brandishing a plastic Glock pistol at a Mackay gun range with a caption paraphrasing the famous Dirty Harry quote.

“You gotta [sic] ask yourself, do you feel lucky, greenie punks?” the post said.

“It’s Not Happening, Tony”: Abbott Asks Rupert Murdoch If He Can Be PM Again

TEXT:

As a weakened Malcolm Turnbull wallows in the mangrove, a Komodo-like Tony Abbott has sniffed an opportunity to get himself back in the top job.

According to Rupert Murdoch, the lizard king, it’s not going to happen.

In high-level talks this morning between The Advocate’s eventual owner and Mr Abbott, Tony floated the idea of perhaps becoming prime minister again.

“What do you say, Roo?” asked the Sydneysider.

“I’m not sure, mate. You’re not polling that well. You’d probably beat Shorten but that’s a big maybe. But in saying that, Labor is in with a red hot chance at the next election,”

“Right,” said Abbott. “So that’s a no?”

“At the moment, yeah it is. But don’t be a mopey cunt about it. Things can change. I’m busy trying to get Barnaby out of the job right now. Provided you don’t lose your seat at the next election, we can talk then. Anyway, I’ve got to go.”

And with that, Tony hung the phone up and walked to the window of his Manly office and smiled.

He began singing Thunder Road to himself softly while he imagined walking down the halls of parliament, high fiving strangers and yahooing loudly.

“Woaaa Oh-oh Thunder Road oh Thunder Road,” he sang in a soft falsetto.

“I’m coming for you Malcolm, you fucking heathen.”

Science Discovers There Are Humans Who Still Get The Train Between Capital Cities

TEXT:

Australia’s peak scientific body has released findings this afternoon on their website that outlines that there are people walking among the rest of us who get the train between the nation’s capital cities.

It was long assumed that with the advent of cheap air travel, the Victorian-era transport method stopped running trains between major cities.

According to the CSIRO, there are people who still elect to travel slow.

“It blew our socks off,” said Gavin Hoskins, from the scientific agency.

“We set out to test the hypothesis that people don’t use the interstate train service anymore and what we found really rattled us. There are people who apparently haven’t heard of air travel yet – or are scared to do so,”

“You can even sleep on these trains. They run overnight between the big three capitals. You can even get the train from Melbourne to Cairns if you want. What the actual fuck?”

The organisation’s researchers also discovered that in terms of pricing, the rail service is often more expensive than the airlines.

“That’s what really had us fucked,” said Hoskins.

“Why are people doing this to themselves? It’s like 15 hours?”

The Advocate reached out to a local train enthusiast who took the time to explain to our reporters just why people still catch the train when there’s a much easier and cheaper option.

Oscar Grossman, that guy in Betoota Heights on Alambie Street with the detailed train set in his garage, said that some people just prefer it.

“It might be hard for people to understand, like I don’t understand how anybody can willingly buy and consume a bottle of Black Sambuca,” he said.

“But you don’t see me looking to persecute and laugh at them,”

“I am a human who gets the train between capitals and I say it proudly. I do it because I like train travel. It’s like a small holiday in itself. You can get wankered in your cabin, visit the dining car for dinner. Get a gut full of red and when you wake up, you’re in Sydney – the land of broken dreams and fuck heads.”

Fund Manager Fears His Family May Be Forced To Ski At Thredbo This Winter As Market Correction Worsens

TEXT:

A long lunch ruined, blood running down the gutters of Sydney’s Bridge Street and one Betoota Grove stockbroker is now a sadbroker.

Alistair Watson-Cove, a partner at Goldman Sachs’ French Quarter offices in the Joh For PM Tower on Cumberland Road, was rudely awoken by Magda, his wife and life coach, this morning as she left for yoga at 6.

But that gave him ample opportunity to roll over in bed, grab his phone from the mid-century Danish nightstand and check the markets.

While the 41-year-old was expected a market correction, he wasn’t expecting the Dow to drop as much as it did overnight.

“And with that, I lept out of bed. Put my RM Williams dressing gown on and ran down the stairs to the home office,” he said.

“I had to sell everything. How didn’t I see this coming? There’s a Republican in the White House, why is the market going backwards?”

But it was too late, the damage was done.

As the market opened this morning, the forlorn Gemini dressed in his least favourite suit and asked his Magda to start the Audi softroader in the driveway.

“I wore my old MJ Bale suit I got when I was just a junior trader. I can machine wash it, I think, so I can spill as much food and wine on it as I want.”

Today was supposed to be a great day, they’d booked the long table at the district’s finest restaurant – Le Marché Des Ours Putains on Rue de Pamplemousse.

However, frantic early morning calls between the Goldman employees confirmed that nobody would be having much fun today.

Though the wine was needlessly expensive and they spent so much money that the owner let them smoke inside, neither of the seven stockbrokers at the table could keep their eyes away from their iPhoneXs for longer than a few minutes.

“Then it hit me like a sledgehammer,” said Alistair, speaking to our reporter emotionally at a local taxi rank.

“I promised my kids that I’d take them to Aspen this year. That’s looking more and more like it won’t be happening. God fucking damn it, man,”

“My family might have to ski on that shitty fake fucking black ice they roll out at Thredbo or fucking Smiggin Holes or something. The wine list is always shit and there’s no fucking gear down there that’s worth doing. Maybe they’d be happy going to Chillagoe caves?”

“There’s Nothing Wrong With The Darling River” Explains Cotton Farmer’s Son In A Bondi Pub

TEXT:

A popular farmer’s son has laughed off suggestions that his family’s cotton farm in Northern NSW is partially responsible for one of the most catastrophic environmental declines in recorded history.

Peter Cruikshank, of Brewarrina, is currently taking time out to relax in Sydney this week ahead of his second year of university study in the Harbour Capital kicking off later this month.

Aside from having his Holden SV6 ute, a 17th birthday present, serviced on his father’s dealership account, any downtime the 23-year-old has is often filled with beers – with the boys.

So on this idle Wednesday afternoon, he put the feelers out to his fellow back-to-front-cap-button-up-shirt-Bermuda-short-wearing-boat-shoe-mafia friends to see who was about for a beer.

They gathered for a long lunch today in Bondi, home to Slammin’ Jim Packer and every other reason why there’s a royal commission into the banking sector.

“Ever since those Four Corners fuck heads did that story about the cotton farmers pinching water, all my mates, even my country mates, all put shit on me for it,” said Peter, hat backwards with a rapidly burning forehead.

“There’s nothing wrong with the Darling River, it’s just going through a correction. The idea that cotton farmers are having an impact on it is stupid and goes against science. We only have 600 ha under irrigation, that’s nothing,”

“Some people have like twice as much. Plus people in the city don’t know what it’s like to have your income depend wholly on Mother Nature. She can be a serious cow sometimes, she can. Anyway, go see the river for yourself. You’ll see it’s just ABC propaganda,”

“That viral video of those sooks out the far south-west is fake. Murray Cod only live to be 80 anyway. They’re made out of paper mache.”

Before he hung up on our reporter, he declined the offer of a Carlton in favour of a Stella, saying he’s trying to keep fit for the upcoming rugby union season.

Local Homeowner Says NBN Is Adequate Because It Said So In The Australian

TEXT:

The last local beacon of 20th-century journalism, The Australian, has one local homeowner under the impression that his current NBN rollout plan and the technology involved with the programme, on the whole, is ‘more than adequate.’

Bruce McIntyre, a Betoota Grove homeowner, said he doesn’t even know when the next evolution of the information superhighway will be connected to his premises – and he doesn’t even care.

The 59-year-old, who also owns three currently empty French Quarter terrace houses, took time out of his busy afternoon of to speak to The Advocate about his opinions on the National Broadband Network.

“I’ve read up a lot on the subject,” he said.

“And from what I’m able to conclude, the first incarnation of the NBN, where they were going to bring it right up into your lounge room, was needlessly complex, expensive and an invasion of privacy,”

“Just the other day, this NBN goon knocked on my 89-year-old mother’s house in Betoota Heights and told her there were there to hook up the NBN – whether she liked it or not! No wonder the costs have blown out if they have it hire thugs to invade the privacy of old ladies.”

When asked how he came to this conclusion, that the current LNP-proposed NBN is just fine and perfectly adequate, the retiree said he’d read it in The Australian.

“It is that last honest newspaper. The bigger a newspaper is, the more authority it has. They’re impartial and down the line. They see the Labor/Green/LDP voters for who they truly are. Treasonous perverts who enjoy spending money that isn’t theirs to spend.”

When our reporter asked Bruce whether he thought the connection between the Murdoch-owned newspaper and their openly pro-Coalition editorial policy may have skewed their reporting on the issue, he told him to leave.

Cabbie Lets Out Guttural Moan Before Conceding It’s Possible To Pay By Card

TEXT:

With the side door to the Green Point Hotel closing behind them, a group of happy-go-lucky nighttime revellers found themselves deep in Betoota Heights without a phone with a charge between them.

All needed to get back down the hill toward the French Quarter to either keep drinking or crawl into their beds.

“Should we call an Uber?” said Boris Gooch, the group’s de facto leader.

“My phone’s flat, seriously. Look, it won’t turn on,” said Mark, who asked to remain relatively anonymous for this story.

“Typical. What about you, Johnno? You got any charge?”

“Nah, boss. Do you?”

“Fuck, nah. I don’t. How the fuck are we going to get home?” said Boris firmly.

All of a sudden, a taxi rounded the bend and cautiously slowed down as the trio contemplated doing something they hadn’t done since they were teenagers.

Out shot Mark’s arm, he was hailing the cab.

“What the fuck are you doing? None of us has any cash!” said Johnno.

“Yeah what the hell, dude. I’m too old to be jumping cabs.”

As the shuddering Falcon screeched to a halt in front of them, they looked at each other to see would be game enough to sit in the front seat.

Mark hailed the cab, so they decided he should ride shotgun.

“Where we going tonight, boys?” said Bill Hershey, a Betoota Ponds-based cab driver.

Mr Hersey shot to local fame in 2001 for saying he’d drive down to Sydney to break both of Mark Latham’s arms after he assaulted a cab driver during a dispute over a fare.

It was the evening of Gough Whitlam’s 85th birthday. Hersey later admitted he would’ve broken Gough’s arms too if he got the chance.

“Ahhh just down to the French Quarter, thanks mate,” said Mark

Bill groaned as the fare was only a short one; less than $70.

“Can we take Mulholland Avenue?”

“Sure thing, mate,” said Bill.

The four of them then sat in silence until the turnoff to Mulholland came up.

Bill blew straight past it.

“It’ll be a bitch for me to get out of town if we go down that way,” he said.

“We’ll take Beattie Drive.”

More breathless moments passed.

No nighttime glow on everybody’s faces from their mobiles, just the warm desert wind coming in the windows against their faces while the unforgettable whirl of the Falcon’s transmission made its way up through the floor.

Twenty minutes later, that’d all been replaced by the neon fuzz and gentle rabble of the vibrant night district.

“That’ll be $34.40, blokes,”

Mark turned from the front seat and smiled back at Johnno and Boris.

“No worries, mate. Here’s my card.”

Bill looked visibly annoyed, scrunched up his face and took his glasses out of his top pocket.

He turned on the cabin light and groaned then sighed while he slowly punched in the numbers.

“It’s not working, mate. Can’t get reception. You got any cash?” said Bill.

“Try it again.”

A short time later, the payment went through and Mark get out to join his friends on the footpath.

“I didn’t know you could do that,” said Boris.

“Yeah I know, right. It’s a bit of a bitch. The cabbies act like you’re asking for a fucking kidney or something. Anyway cunts, both of you own me two schooners of the good stuff.”

CSIRO Doubles Effort To Clone Shane Warne After China Successfully Clones Primates

TEXT:

Scientists from Australia’s peak scientific body have announced they will attempt to clone Shane Warne before the end of this year.

The news comes following the successful cloning of primates by scientists in China to study the effects of disease on genetically identical mammals.

“This is the next logical step in the cloning timeline,” says professor Warwick Baxter from the CSIRO in Canberra.

“After they (Chinese scientists) managed to clone a couple of monkeys it made sense to use these techniques for something that can benefit the cricket, Australia in particular.”

Australia has been in the legspin wilderness since Shane Warne retired gracefully in 2006, leaving behind a void that’s yet to be filled.

While a number of decent tweakers have come through the system since then, the Australian public has never fully accepted them into their hearts.

CSIRO researchers have been trying to find ways of developing that talent for quite some time.

“We tried injecting Nathan Hauritz with some of Warnie’s DNA,” said professor Baxter.

“It only made him take up smoking for 12 days but unfortunately did nothing for his doosra. Offspin doesn’t really count, though. Every red-blooded male in this country has an offie they crank out on Christmas Day,”

“We also injected some of Shane’s blood into Steve Smith a few years ago, which only resulted in him scoring bulk runs. It’s left a lot of people confused and on-edge.”

Professor Baxter has earmarked 2018 as the year they successfully clone the leg-spin legend, however, they have been quite secretive about the techniques involved in this groundbreaking attempt.

It is believed Stuart MacGill volunteered his DNA for research, but he never heard back from the CSIRO.

Hottest 100 Listening Party Goes Into Overdrive As Somebody Just Got Pushed In The Pool

TEXT:

If Dave Petersen thought his white-linen shirt couldn’t get any whiter, getting soaked in chlorinated water and being exposed to alt-J in direct sunlight will surely make it so.

Somebody at the Betoota Grove party just pushed the 25-year-old banker into the pool, a clear indication that the festivities are about to kick up a notch.

“Oh my God, bro,” he shouted.

“You’re lucky I got the new iPhone, dude. They’re waterproof [laughs] Seriously, though. Whoever did that is a dead man walking.”

Trying not to meekly giggle about the whole debacle was Matty Turner, who’s hosting the party at his parent’s leafy six-bedder on Collon Road – just opposite the mayor’s house.

By all indications, he was guilty.

Dave took a sip of his now chlorinated Heineken and hauled his body out of the water.

Matty’s father wasn’t there to tell them off for having glass in the pool, nor to stop them from running around it.

He was playing golf, his mother was upstairs having a Valium-induced lie down with a bottle of red and the Very Best of Fleetwood Mac.

They were free; they were infinite.

“Dude, you’re so fucked!” shouted Dave as he started chasing Matty around the Tuscan-inspired pool area.

The rest of the guests erupted in glee watching the duo act the goat.

All the while the countdown had reached 50 without anybody so much as saying ‘Track!’ aloud.

When asked if they’d be intently listening to the rest of the countdown, they said they would.

Local Shell Of A Human Ventures Down To Shops To Get A Powerade, Sausage Roll

TEXT:

Telling himself this time yesterday that he’d be home tucked in bed by 9, a now-broken pub chef spoke to our reporters briefly while he popped down the road to his local shops to get some supplies.

“Yeah, it was pretty large,” said Brett Douglas as he gulped down a red Powerade, his least favourite flavour.

“Got back at like 6 this morning from Fred’s [popular nightclub] in the Old City District. Went to go see a mate DJ. Good night, but.”

When asked what he planned to do for the rest of the day, the 23-year-old said he planned to spend it like any other Saturday.

He was to prepare for a night’s work down at the Dolphins Leagues Club by sleeping and resting as much as he could.

“I actually feel pretty good. Me and my two housemates went down to the quarry this morning and had a dip. They’re back on the beers now listening to the Hottest 100, don’t know how they do it. But man, you should’ve seen Sam my housemate try and do a backflip off the jump rock this morning,”

“He fucked the whole thing up and landed flat on his back. It was the funniest fucking thing. When he came up to the surface and we knew he wasn’t dead, we all just stood there laughing at him. Man, he was just moaning and bobbing, trying not to drown. Oh bro, you had to be there.”

Brett pulled himself together, shook our reporter’s hand and began skating down the middle of the road back to his French Quarter share house.

Ticking Sounds From 60 Minutes Clock Depressing Reminder That The Weekend Is Over

TEXT:

For a little while there, Bronwyn Williams forgot that she would be entering her place of employment in just over 12 hours, that was until the unique sound of the 60 minutes clock began ticking aggressively.

For many, the sound of the ticking clock is associated with a warning that some excruciatingly mediocre journalism will be on their TV screens for the next 60 minutes.

For hedonistic millennials who like to enjoy weekends fuelled by drugs and or alcohol, and end up severely dopamine depraved by Sunday afternoon/evening, the ticking clock is also a stark reminder that the weekend is over. Done and dusted.

The once-groundbreaking program conceived under the reign of Kerry Packer, 60 minutes is still a staple in many households across the country and serves to remind Williams every single Sunday night that she has pissed away her weekend once again.

“Ah fuck. Lying on the couch like the shell of a human I am, it always makes me wonder, should I have done something a little different with my weekend?” she told our reporters a short time ago.

“Maybe a nice quiet weekend away down the Sunshine Coast. Maybe I could even just spend some time with my family. I don’t know, I just always get this longing sense of regret after the fact.”

“Anyway. Weekends over. Get out. I wanna watch this story about some stranger with a rare medical illness I’ve never heard off.”

Entire Group Chat Gradually Likes Instagram Photo They’ve Been Bitching About All Day

TEXT:

A local girl has today committed an act that has become the norm amongst male and female social media users. Aliesha Handley-Smith (26) took a screenshot of Kate Simpson’s latest Instagram post and sent it directly to her all female group chat. 

“Omg, Kate’s latest Insta” accompanied the photo. 

The photo in question is one that see’s Kate, Instagram name keepingupwithkate, kneeling in front of a mirror with a concave arch in her spine, a technique employed by a number influencers that gives the illusion of a fuller, more peach-like butt.  

“Can she get a grip?” One member replied.  

“Omg what does her boyfriend think about this?” Questioned another. 

“’K E E N // F O R // P E A C H’ wtf!?! I literally can’t deal” Another shot back. 

One group member, who wished to remain anonymous, is referring to the caption that Kate uploaded with her photo, which The Advocate understands is a double entendre that is essentially a sexual proposition to her followers. 

Sources have told The Advocate that the entire group chat have since liked Kate’s photo on Instagram and commented on it, the comments ranging from “yaass girl, [fire emoji] [peach emoji]” to “omg, slay!” some members even tagged Kate’s boyfriend. 

The Advocate reached out to social media expert and behavioural psychologist, Dr. Christopher Walking, to see why this two-faced trend exists. 

“Well, it’s simple really. These girls just haven’t matured yet. Another factor worth acknowledging is that the majority of these girls are Gemini’s, who are notorious for this kind of behaviour” 

The world is definitely a more complicated place now, all we can advise is keep your friends close, and your frenemies closer.

Turnbull Celebrates Just What It Is To Be Australian Over Swordfish Steak And Penfolds

TEXT:

Before beginning his private celebration of BBQ and beverages (swordfish steak and vintage Penfolds) Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull took a chance to address to the mounting controversy of Australia Day stating it is a non-issue.

“It’s a day to recognise our history and celebrate together, just as the settlers and Indigenous Australians did when they first met on this most amazing day.”

With many citizens unconvinced by this response, Turnbull took things a step further and urged anyone with problems regarding the date of Australia Day to take it up with opposition leader Bill Shorten.

“Look, Australia Day is for all Australians no matter how our stories began. But if you disagree you should know its entirely Labor’s fault.”

Citing Australia becoming a nationwide day of celebration and eventually a public holiday during the Hawke and Keating years, Turnbull stated those against the date need to consider that Australia Day is the fault of politicians they were too young to have voted for.

“They sowed this seed back under Whitlam. It’s their fault”

Amidst some activists calling his comments discriminative, Turnbull was quick to remind them he can’t be as he has a granddaughter with Chinese heritage, something Bill Shorten certainly doesn’t have.

“Journalists” from left-wing youth publications were quick to remind Turnbull that while some fault does lie with left-leaning politicians from 25 years ago, he himself does have the power to change the date.

“If it’s such a hot topic, I don’t know, maybe we can have another plebiscite or something. The last one was such a success after all.”

Hillsonger Turns Off Hottest 100 After Hearing Language Warning

TEXT:

Martin West feels as if he’s dodged a bullet today. While listening to the Hottest 100 at a neighbour’s BBQ, the Hills district father of three acted fast and switched the radio off after the announcement of a language warning.

“Signs from above come in all shapes and sizes man. This one came from the empowered but approachable voice of youth telling me I was about to hear bad words.”

Despite the protests from his children and several other party goers, West was determined to keep the radio switched off until he guessed the song had finished.

“And I guessed the time pretty bang on but no one is talking about that. I bet you don’t even report it.”

Disgruntled partygoers later determined the song West skipped was in fact DNA by Kendrick Lamar, a song the artist himself has called a gospel song, a fact that has startled the usually conservative West.

“That’s great there’s more gospel out there but do we need to have all these swear words in it? What’s wrong with a good old fashion hymn?”

While it’s been years since he last listened to triple j, West feels like the music now is more profane than the music of his youth.

“It’s a shame they feel the need to curse in order to sound cool. The only swear that should leave their lips is the name of our Lord and Saviour: Jesus Christ! Haha! Get it?”

Every public holiday Anton Brooks is caught between two stools.

One stool is making double the amount he normally does for doing half the work he normally does.

The other stool is indulging himself in some mass produced sausages on high carb white bread while enjoying a few drinks of choice with his friends.

“Every year I spend the month leading up to a public holiday telling myself that it’s smart to lock myself away in the confines of employment at the hardware store I work at (Jims Bits N Bobs),” he told The Advocate today.

“And then the day rolls around. Everyone in my share house starts getting excited. They wake up in the morning and are bubbling with joy at the chance to have a free day to consume as much drugs and/or alcohol as they want, and I start to feel very sad” he said.

Brooks told us that as he gets dressed and heads out the door he starts to really feel like it would have been good to jump on the other stool.

“Just for once it would be good. I have worked the last three Aus and Anzac days for fuck sake. It would be nice to just blow out one day.”

“Once I finish this  degree that’s going to in-debt me for the rest of my life and only improve my chances of career success and satisfaction marginally then I can enjoy myself on this public holidays.”

Brooks’ house mate Jack Marshall told us he feels moderately sorry for the long term retail sufferer.

Proud Australian Already An Embarrassment To Australia

TEXT:

It’s not even dark yet and Tomas Bird (26) has made a fool of himself.

The market analyst at a local firm in Betoota spent all week winding himself up about Australia Day, and it has come back to bite him.

Friends of the Betoota born and raised man told us that the writing was on the wall early for Bird.

“You could see it was only going to end in tears,” said friend Lucy Young.

“He strolled in with a carton, and immediately looked ‘on.’ Birdy pulled out a six pack and threw a couple at the other boys and requested that “They fucking bomb those right now,” said Young.

Young said that poor ‘Birdy’ has a habit of getting over excited.

“You could compare him with a little puppy I guess? But instead of lowering his bum and pissing on the floor when someone pats him, he just drinks too much and vomits on himself,” she said.

As the day wears on, Birdy has already been involved in a physical confrontation with a close childhood friend, and taken part in a very public argument with his girlfriend

Slumped in a camping chair with a warming beer in his hand, Bird told us that he is aware he is a disappointment.

“Yeah whatever. I don’t even care,” he slurred.

“I vomited on myself before and told Simsy I hated his girlfriend of 3 years but fuck I don’t know, if you can’t let your hair down every now and then what can you do?”

Great, Lack Of Hottest 100 Means Todd Is In Charge Of The Aux Cord Today

TEXT:

Partygoers at a house in the French Quarter are going to suffer immensely today as a result of Triple J’s decision to move its famous countdown.

The BBQ hosted by Toddy Sampson has pulled a solid group of people, and his share house has a pretty good set up.

Nice backyard. Big wooden table. Quality BBQ. Large spread of couches inside.

Everything bills well.

However, due to a lack of universally accepted soundtrack to Australia day parties anymore, the attendees of the little summer soiree will have to suffer at the hands of Todd’s playlist.

“It’s my party and I’ll play the tunes I want to,” he laughed candidly to The Advocate.

“Besides, it’s not like I’m gonna play gross poppy stuff, or any bogan shit. I’ve actually made up my own little Hottest 100 style playlist to accompany us. It should be pretty good.”

Todd’s close friend Bella McRaig explained her concerns to us.

“I love Todd, I’m looking forward to today, but I am not looking forward to his handpicked playlist,” she said.

“It’s going to be a mashup of Courtney Barnett, Alice Ivy, Flight Facilities and some random other shit.”

Bella asked us why Todd couldn’t make a playlist with something for everyone.

“Some Kendrick, some Gang Of Youths, some Banks, I don’t know a bit of variety, you can’t please everyone obviously but give us a bit please,” he said.

Random Bloke At Kick-On Tells Uncomfortably Long Story With No Climax

TEXT:

A random bloke who has somehow gotten a bait to an intimate bender kick-on has just spent the last twenty minutes telling a story that is purely designed to keep people listening for as long as possible.

The story, which started with a bit of momentum, has spiralled off into a bizarre anecdote with no real punchline or climax.

In fact, there doesn’t seem to be any form of ending to this yarn at all.

The bloke, who’s name might be like Dan or Dane (?), has already been twice reprimanded for trying to talk about politics and other deep shit like war – so this most recent fuck up marks a third strike.

However, as the sun begins sizzling through the window and the birds begin chirping, Dan (or Dane?) is excused for his behaviour – as it is quite clear that he completely forgot what he was talking about halfway through that piece of shit story.

As the host of the house begins texting his cab driver mate to drop off some more grog, Dan (or Dane?) makes an absolutely abhorrent suggestion to play a drinking game.

“Mate, it’s like six o’clock in the morning and we’ve got a couple tickets enroute. We aren’t playing drinking games. What the fuck?” says the least sympathetic guest, Dixy.

“How old are you?”

Luckily for Dan (or Dane?) all is forgiven once he reveals that he’s about six years younger than everyone else and it becomes clear that he is completely out of his depth.

Bank Of Mum & Dad Announce Huge Profit Downgrade As Property Bubble Finally Bursts

TEXT:

One of the nation’s largest private lenders to the Millennial generation has downgraded their profit forecasts for Q3 and Q4 this year amid a cooling property market and tumbling exports.

The Bank Of Mum & Dad [BMD], outlined by then-Treasurer Joe Hockey as the only financial institution able to help young people into home ownership, spoke to shareholders this morning in Sydney where they explained that moving forward in this economic climate would be challenging.

“Our investment portfolios are heavily geared to take advantage of the expanding property market, which has now started to slow so there will be some hits to profits this financial year,” said BMD chairman Spencer Alistair-Willmott Snr.

“However, analysts have tipped a resurgence in mineral projects. Gold and iron ore miners can expect a big year. While the volatility surrounding lithium mining bubbles as Elon Musk give’s than entire sector an unenthusiastic handjob, we can expect these new investments to offset those we’ve felt from the property market.”

Young homeowner and mortgagee, Grovenor Pearson-Collins, said that the initial $340 000 loan he took from BMD to pay a house deposit with late last year, is now on shaky ground.

In October, the 29-year-old finance worker, who works alongside but underneath his father at a major Australian investment bank after spending six years at Bond doing a business studies degree, used a loan from BMD to secure a mortgage – as per Joe Hockey’s instruction.

But now it all seems like that was for nothing, according to the downhearted go-getter.

“My house is now worth less than what I paid for it,” he said.

“How has this happened? Everybody said that my money could only go north on a property? Now the bank I’m lending from has come out and said that iron ore is the new property market! This is bullshit,”

“I had to beg, borrow and steal to get that loan from Mum & Dad over the line and now it seems all my efforts to grow as a human being have been made redundant by a cooling market,”

“Fuck you Mum & Dad! If you need me, I’ll be in Vale.”

Devoted Uni Feminist Refuses To Be Distracted By Trivial Things Like Issues Facing Minorities

TEXT:

Last Friday a rally was held in the courtyard of Betoota’s leading tertiary educator, The University Of Western Queensland, to protest the poisonous inequality that’s come to consume the campus.

Becky Greer (27), founder of the Loudest Voice hosted the rally to draw attention to the plight of those who she believes are the last minority to be exposed to oppression – middle class white Australian females.

The Advocate caught up with Becky shortly after the protest to see what exactly her positioning was and what grounds the group was formed under.

“Surely you’re aware of this whole inequality thing? Do you watch Girls?”

“Don’t people think middle class white women deserve equality too?”

“I do. Gay marriage has come and gone. But for me, the fight isn’t over until I see equality for people like myself. And when I do, It will end immediately”

“You might not know because you’re obviously not halfway through a business/media degree so aren’t really exposed to that many middle class white women. But it’s the most immediate civil rights battle, in my opinion, as someone who has never left the suburbs and don’t really know anyone who isn’t anglo middle class Australian.

Australian Human Rights Commission spokesperson, Caroline Taggart, shared her thoughts on The Loudest Voice and revealed whether or not a partnership might develop between the Commission and The Loudest Voice.

“Yes, Becky has reached out to me a number of times, she’s definitely committed to her cause”

“It’s just, I’ve got bigger issues here. As a middle class white female myself, I can’t say I experience the same discrimination as other minorities in our community… But maybe things have changed at Women’s College”.

The Advocate understands there’ll be a national march held for WWHRT on September the 14th, outside Parliament house, with hopes of a non-denominational lamb barbecue at the end for everyone to celebrate the end of inequality forever.

Sadist PE Teacher Plans Surprise Beep Test First Week Back From Holidays

TEXT:

Phil O’Regan, known locally as a popular physical education teacher at the Delroy Academy South Betoota Campus, has been forced to defend allegations today that he’s actually a sadist hellbent on causing misery to all of his students.

The news comes after the 34-year-old revealed plans to set a baseline for his students’ fitness this semester by making them do a beep test on the first week back from spring holidays.

Despite outcry from the student body, a spokesman from the PE department has confirmed the measures, which they say will help them better assess their students’ needs and cater to each pupil individually.

“There will be dozens of students with their fingers clasped on the chainlink fence beside the tennis court while they throw their breakfast up onto their Reeboks,” said O’Regan.

“And it will be glorious. There’s no better feeling than being fit, trust me. Delroy strives to unlock the personal best within each and every student. If that means pushing them to their absolute physical limit after 6 weeks of binge eating and inactivity, then so be it,”

“I’m not a sadist, I just love fitness. See you all in class soon, boys and girls.”

The Advocate reached out to a number of Mr O’Regan’s students, only one of which was prepared to go on the record and share their feelings on the matter.

Others were concerned about possible reprisal attacks from the PE department.

Mark* spoke to our reporters about his impending death at the hands of Mr O’Regan.

“Why do beep tests exist?” he said.

“Mr O’Regan said the special forces use it for training. Guess what, I don’t want to join the special forces. I’m not even old enough to drive yet. All I want to do in my first week back from school is sit in these new airconditioned demountables and catch up with people,”

“But no, I’m out in the 40-degree heat listening to a robot give me instructions while I run up and down a tennis court. If I drop out at level 4, O’Regan will make me run laps because he knows come summer time, I’ll be running cross country to get out of playing cricket.”

New App Replaces Tennis Grunts With Sounds Of Toddlers Having Tantrums

TEXT:

Viewers asked for it and now Australia’s peak scientific body has delivered.

In the lead up to the Australian Open, Network Seven polled thousands of tennis viewers about what they either love or don’t love about the tennis coverage.

Close to 9 in 10 people said they’d be inclined to watch something else because of the ‘tennis grunting’ – a relatively modern addition to the game aimed at putting off an opponent.

But now, there’s a new app that replaced the screams of tennis players with those of a small child.

“It’s quite full on,” said Ben Carter, a local tennis fan who told The Advocate that sometimes the grunting can be too much for him.

“People think it’s just the women who do it but what a lot of people don’t realise is that the men do it twice as much and twice as loud,”

“Go back and watch Nadal play on YouTube. It’s deafening. Not to mention the like of Sharapova, but. It’s been in the news recently, how those bougie Melbournese people mocked that European girl about her grunting. It’s not that I don’t think it should be part of the game, it’s just that I don’t want to hear it.”

Thanks to the CSIRO, who’ve spend more Commonwealth money developing nice things for all Australians, you don’t have to listen to all that racket anymore.

Earlier this afternoon, a spokesman from the popular scientific agency said they’ve released an app to help replace the grunting, which is now available for download on most SmartTV app stores as well as Google Play and the iTunes Store.

“For the first time in a long time, you can enjoy tennis in the comfort of your own home,”

“You can enjoy it without the grunts, we’ve replaced them with a more placed sound such as toddlers screaming and the like. We’re working on recording the sound of a pig being eaten alive by a polar bear but the zoo doesn’t open until tomorrow morning so stay tuned,”

“It should be good. We, scientists, hate the grunting as much as you people do.”

Conspiracy: No One Seems To Know How The Loo Got Clogged

TEXT:

A question as old as time itself failed to be answered yet again in South Betoota today as local family, The Turners, cannot seem to figure out who clogged the toilet.

Despite mum reminding everyone that no one will be in trouble for it, a culprit is yet to come forward. Eldest daughter Beth Turner (13) states she is sceptical about her mother’s claims.

“If no one is in trouble, why does it matter who did it? Not that it was me. I saw it and that was a grown man’s shit for sure. If it was even human.”

Eldest child Jake Turner (17) admits while he did use the toilet on the day of the clogging, it was reportedly working fine when he did.

“Yeah I’d be lying if I said I didn’t drop a grog bog in there first thing Sunday morning but honestly it flushed fine. That was me done for the day. I watched a bit of Netflix after so whoever did the poo must have done it between 10am and 8pm if that helps.”

Mother of four Catherine Turner (42) says it’s important to figure out how it happened so they can determine how best to approach the situation. Ask for her opinion as to what happened and you might find it raises more questions than it answers.

“It looks as if someone went and didn’t flush and then someone took another dump on top of that, went to flush and the toilet just couldn’t handle it. I’ve been a mum for 17 years I thought I’d seen everything but fuck me, I can’t believe I live with someone who could do that.”

Man of the house John Turner (48) was able to back up his wife’s claims with new and disturbing information.

“Look, the dog shit indoors again and I’m the only one who ever bloody does anything about it so I picked it up with some toilet paper and chucked it in the dunny. By the time it hit the water I realised there was something was wrong.”

“It was floating right near the rim in this big pool of shitty water. The whole thing was clogged and I couldn’t fish it out because I didn’t know which shit was dog shit and which was human turds so I tried to flush it again but…but…”

While John’s story provides insight into the time the clog must have taken place it still doesn’t answer who the original clogger or cloggers were, leaving the Turners back at square one.

For now, Mr Turner is happy to dip into the savings account to hire a local plumber or failing that, a priest.

Speaking exclusively with The Advocate father of four John Turner left us with this final statement.

“The visiting sisters-in-law didn’t help. This turned into Murder She Wrote”

“What’s Wrong With The NBN?” Wonders Turnbull As He Downloads An Episode Of QI In 20 Minutes

TEXT:

Recalling his favourite episode of British variety show, QI, the Prime Minister retired to his study to find and download it from the internet.

As the internet is reportedly quite fast in the leafy Sydney peninsula of Point Piper, Malcolm Turnbull thought he’d have time to hose down his kayak after finding the episode on a Pirate Bay mirror site and get the download going.

But he was wrong.

The episode arrived in 20 minutes, the 100mbit internet connection making short work of the 140mb file.

Turnbull, shocked at the blistering speed, spoke to The Advocate a short time ago after ‘his head stopped spinning.’

“You should’ve seen it,” he said.

“There I was, down on my jetty after getting the download going. Next thing I know, I’m halfway through hosing the kayak down and Lucy screams from the balcony that the download has finished,”

“I was blown away. Why does everybody say the NBN is terrible? How much speed do they want? The speed that I’m getting is very impressive. You can get a download going and then you’ve got time to do other things, like catch up on housework and the like.”

Never the less, the internet speeds at the editorial offices of the Betoota Advocate aren’t quite as good.

Our reporters spoke to a local information technology person and told him what the Prime Minister told The Advocate.

The person paused and thought carefully about what he was going to say.

“Ah well,” he said.

“I’m not surprised. I’m not surprised that Malcolm like QI. I used to like it when Stephen Fry was running the show. The new stuff is like the new Top Gear,”

“Sometimes I feel like running away and joining the French Foreign Legion. I won’t need to worry about the internet when I’m chasing Al Shabaab through the sandhills of Mali, will I?

Housemate Prepares Ultra-Sensitive “Your Boyfriend Is Staying Over Too Much” Speech

Jasmine Saunders (26) and her best friend Kim Roquette (25) have only been living together in their Betoota Greens flat for 6 months, however, Jasmine has already developed a grievance with Kim – her boyfriend, or as Jasmine refers to him while bitching to their friends, their 3rd housemate. 

The Advocate caught up with Jasmine following the final dress rehearsal of the ultra-sensitive speech she is going to deliver to Kim later tonight. 

“I’m going to try and frame it like I miss doing stuff with her, rather than the truth – which is, he’s annoying and eats all our food.” 

“She’s a bit delicate when it comes to confrontation, so I’ll just be like, ‘don’t get me wrong, I love Adam, but it’s like we never get to hang out, just us anymore’” 

The Advocate understands that Jasmine has enlisted the help of her Toastmasters mentor, Paul Whitewash, to help her pull through more emotion and sincerity in her speech. 

“Jasmine has a refreshing candour about her, however in this instance its best for her to lie” 

“We’ve been focussing on her intonations and pronunciations. A bit of ‘red leather yellow leather’ never goes astray either” 

With the speech time looming, we can only hope that Jasmine’s conscientious approach to confronting the issue pays off.

Grown Man Identifies As A 10-Year-Old Boy To Gain Access To Pub’s Kid Menu

TEXT:

A well-known French Quarter publican says he’s between a rock and a hard place at the moment because one of his locals has begun ordering food from the kid’s menu – saying he now identifies as a 10-year-old boy.

Jock Campbell, publican of the esteemed Gorille De Vomi Bar & Grill on Rue de Overell, said that popular local Morris Pearson has been ordering and eating the kid’s $5 chicken nuggets and chips when it should only be enjoyed by those under 12.

It’s a loophole he’s keen to close, as more and more grown men and women are beginning to cotton on to the ploy.

“What do I do? It’s not 1998 anymore, we’ve moved on from the halcyon days of casual and friendly homophobia and the like. Just go back and watch Friends. The writers should be ashamed of themselves,” said Campbell.

“It cheapens the genuine cases of identity dysmorphia, which does exist in our society. But who am I to make that judgment? I used to only have to worry about keeping the beer cold and the food tasty, now I’ve got a whole other crop of things to worry about,”

“Like offending Morris when I tell him to, ‘Go get a packet of chips from the vending machine if you’re hungry, nuggets are for children, you spoonhead!’ I can’t say that to him. I can’t say that to anybody.”

However, our reporters asked Jock what he does when the 10-year-old Morris comes to the bar and orders a refreshing lager or wanders into the pokie den to feed Pelican Pete.

As it turns out, he reverts back to his birth identity in some parts of the bar and elects to be 10-year-old in other areas.

The Advocate reached out to Morris for comment but said his parents don’t let him talk to strangers.

Private School Boy Wonders What Went Wrong After Having His Conviction Recorded

TEXT:

There were chaotic scenes this morning at the French Quarter local courts after the son of a prominent banker failed to have his conviction sealed by the court.

Johnathon Hugh-Poon, the 19-year-old second born son of Betoota Grove hedgefund manager Alastair Poon, pleaded guilty to a string of charges earlier this month under the proviso that his convictions would not be recorded.

However, the public prosecutor negged on the plea bargain under the advice of Magistrate Sandra Brown who felt that the punishment did not fit the crime.

In October last year, Johnathon stole his father’s late model BMW with two friends and went on a joyride.

Alastair, seeing that his car was missing, phoned the police to report it stolen.

Police were quick to find the car and attempted to pull it over – but Johnathon and his partners in crime refused to and led police on an hour-long chase through the windy backroads of Betoota Heights.

A roadblock was set up to put an end to the chase but the fugitive was able to dodge it.

Moments before the sun came up, the car ran out of petrol and the boys fled on foot.

Johnathon was run down by Probationary Constable Greg Porter, who in a previous life trialled for a spot in the North Queensland Cowboys trial team.

Days later while recovering from his two broken arms, bruised spine, concussion and gravel rash in hospital, he was formally charged with several offences.

However, due to his father’s immense wealth and personal connections, he was granted bail immediately and was due in court when he felt up to it.

Until today, proceeds progressed as normal.

Mr Hugh-Poon will be sentenced on October 13.

Mass demonstrations by the Bankers & Surgeons Union of Australia have been planned and approved by police and the shire council.

It is a growing attitude held by well-looked after Generation X employees both within the public broadcaster and commercial media companies across the country stubbornly refuse to up-skill, while simultaneously complaining about job security during each organisational restructure.

One of these 40-something TV and radio lifer is a woman named Bronte Rozelle, a mother of two adorable little pre-teens from Sydney’s peninsular suburb of Drummoyne – she’s just one of many distressed middle-aged government servants who can’t see why every single Australian isn’t tuning in to analog television at 8:30 each night to watch The Catering Show.

“There’s a lot of storms in a lot of teacups – It’s like, if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. That’s what I always say [laughter]”

Bronte says her career at the ABC has been great, but she’s not so sure about the new management and their push for people to learn more about the contemporary media landscape.

“Oh that Twitter stuff… I don’t know anything about that” she says, before signalling to an 18-year-old colleague to find a way to get her 35-minute long form video interview published across all social media platforms.

“My kids know all about Facebook and Minecraft… I’m just a bit of a luddite” she laughs, seemingly oblivious that half of the ABC’s current news and comedy is just rehashed content pulled from Twitter, including the sixteen hours of content they dedicate to President Trump each day.

As an inner-city homeowner with a completely paid-out terrace house that was purchased fifteen years ago on two ABC incomes, Bronte can’t believe how much time is spent talking about ‘new media’ – as she believes the tried and true nightly viewing format will never change, mainly because she doesn’t want it to.

“The radio and TV numbers are still going quite strong” she says.

“I don’t think we really have to worry for now. Although we do sometimes put our stuff on online”

“I usually have to get one of these young helpers [unpaid interns] to send a Twitter out to social media”

Seven Wins Broadcast Rights To Commonwealth Games With 6-Pack Of Oettinger Pilsners

TEXT:

It was an offer too good to refuse, according to a spokesman from the Commonwealth Games.

After a fierce battle between rival networks, Channel Seven has come out on top after offering Games executives a 6-pack of Oettinger Pilsners, a popular beer among students and value seekers.

Seven reportedly countered the Nine Network’s offer of a soiled pair of Diesel jeans and a frisbee at the eleventh hour of negotiations.

“The jeans were quite nice, but we had to go with the beer,” said Dirk Poncho, a person employed by the Games committee to negotiate the television rights.

“The total value of the rights was around $40 yes the 6-pack is only worth a fifth of that. However, we couldn’t take Nine’s deal because more than one person in the office wanted the jeans and frisbee,”

“Channel 10 was more flexible. They came in with a ham quiche but they dropped it just as they walked into the boardroom. Terrible. They also had two lighters and a blunt steak knife but at the end of the day, we thought the beer would be better for all involved.”

Speaking candidly to The Advocate regarding the deal, Seven’s chief negotiator, Dennis Cleary, said he feels the network paid too much for the rights but is optimistic that it’ll all work out.

“I thought I was fucked when that bloke in the backward flat cap from Ten rocked in with the egg pie,” said Dennis.

“But then it slipped out the front of the box and splattered all over his Air Maxes. Very funny. Anyway, turns out cold beer is always a winner,”

“We’re happy with the result.”

Local Advertising Agency Has A Cool Motorbike In Reception

TEXT:

The hottest new agency in Betooticon Valley bought a display motorcycle for their reception area today, ushering a new era of cool.

Branlette Mouille has overtaken Clemenger Betoota BBDO as the hippest, most-in-demand agency in town and many in the local industry suspect it might have something to do with the Yamaha Cruiser they’ve just put in reception.

Prospective clients have also reportedly had their socks blown off by the two-wheel vehicle, saying that it’s got a real Melbourne vibe without actually trying too hard.

“Just like our team,” says Brett Goblin, Branlette Mouille’s lead creative.

“We like to invest in people and ideas. No suits here, just t-shirts, fucked jeans and ironic tattoos. Clients love our raw passion for advertising and SEO. Little wonder why we’re number one in town right now,”

“In addition to our motorcycle, we also offer clients scotch to drink while they’re waiting. We have plans to expand on this by offering a shoe shine and beard trim. But for now, the Yamaha will have to do! [laughs]”

Echoing the Goblin’s sentiments was a representative from a prospective client who spoke to The Advocate a short time ago.

He was quick to praise the yellow crotch rocket and even asked the receptionist how they got it up to the third floor.

“Turns out they just put it in the lift! Crazy. Imagine that, doors open and there’s a man with a motorbike! Random! Anyway, love what they’re doing here at Branlette Mouille. We’re big fans of their work. Just look at all the Cairns [sic] Lions they have at the reception! Soon they’ll run out of space!”

“Anyway, I represent a small fencing company in South Betoota and we’re looking to jazz up our look with a slick TVC. Our budget isn’t that big, maybe $500 or $600. Depends on what they pitch. Sound a great to hear what they have to say,”

“I’m just about to go into a meeting and this motorbike has filled me with confidence.”

“Can’t Wait For The New Stadiums,” Says Sydneysider On Crowded, Late Train

TEXT:

Denise Coleman, who left Betoota during the Great Brain Drain of 2004, said she’s beginning to regret her decision to move to the Harbour capital.

She saw the city as Australia’s only truly international city, a place where she could put her hard-won commerce degree to good use.

So she took the plunge and moved down there with an overnight bag full of dreams and the savings from a summer job.

That was then.

This morning, the 37-year-old risk analyst is riding to work on a filthy, unairconditioned train with two thousand of her closest friends.

Denise spoke to The Advocate a short time ago via mobile messaging service, WhatsApp.

“I hate this city,” she said.

“Why would you spend all that money on two fucking stadiums? Because some fucking Roosters fans and private school boy rah-rah legends complained about the wait time for hot chips? The other stadium, if it was a person, would barely be old enough to drink in a fucking pub!”

“It’s like Campbell Newman is running the show here. Useless! Mate, I don’t even live that far out of town. Imagine we’re talking about Brisbane. I reckon I’d be somewhere around Bracken Ridge. But somehow it’s hotter and filthy down here. Sorry, I’m just so tired of doing this.”

After hearing of Denise’s plight on the coalface of the Sydney experience, a number of local financial institutions were keen to get in touch with her.

One in particular, Berkshire Hathaway Betoota, explained to our reporters that since they decentralized and moved their Australian office to Betooticon Valley last year, productivity has been up significantly.

The Nebraska-based multinational said they’d be open to interviewing Ms Coleman for an upcoming position.

However, she explained that she’d have to politely decline the offer.

“But all my friends live here and if I went home, I’d be so, so bored. It sounds like a good job and I invest in crypto like Warren Buffett but yeah, Betoota’s just a bit too Adelaide for me right now.”

Man Realises He’s Old After Gasps Replace Laughter During Recent Fall

TEXT:

A few short years ago, Marty Dollarhyde was playing Golden Oldies league with his old Betoota Dolphins teammates from the late 1960’s.

He’s given that way now, his knees and hips are simply shot.

But back then, that didn’t stop the barnstorming 70-year-old from putting the shoulder into a broken body or two.

His friends and family laughed and giggled when he took on the wrong defender and ended up being lifted way beyond the horizontal and speared dangerously into the cricket pitch.

Even Marty laughed.

However, that was then and this is now.

In front of his small family, he fell down two short steps this morning in his boutique Betoota Grove home.

They gasped, somebody even screamed.

Marty couldn’t get his arms out in time and the floor raced up towards him.

The rich Oregon floorboards negatively geared his internal organs as he let out a soft moan.

“Marty!” screamed his wife, Julia.

“Dad! Oh My God! Are you OK?” added his daughter, Megan.

He could only roll over onto his side.

A loud ringing in both ears indicated that his head and bounced on the ground like a schoolyard tennis ball.

The taste of blood emerged in his mouth.

With all his might, he tried to wiggle his toes. They wiggled.

Speaking to The Advocate a short time ago from his private hospital bead, the septuagenarian said he suddenly feels old.

“I feel a bit worse for wear,” he said.

“A few years ago I would’ve been fine. God damn my body hurt, the doctors say I could be in here for a week or two. Jesus wept, I’ve got property to invest in and a job to hog,”

“My family just stood around me after the fall and gasped. They thought I was dead. My son-in-law could barely hide his disappointment when he came to visit just before. Am I that old?”

“I Don’t Get Sunburnt,” Says Local Moron About To Be Sunburnt

TEXT:

Despite claims that his ‘olive skin’ tans and doesn’t burn, a local moron is determined to prove himself right this afternoon, refusing the offer of sunscreen from a friend.

“I don’t burn,” said Matthew Stick, a person who works in an office and gets paid monthly.

“There’s Mediterranean blood in me. We don’t need sunscreen, just a little tanning oil and that’s it. I can’t remember the last time I was badly sunburnt. The ozone has repaired a lot, you know?”

Strange, according to one friend who joined the 24-year-old on the shores of Betoota Ponds for a swim today.

The fact that Matt remembers being sunburnt at some point in his life, just not when it happened – despite claiming he doesn’t get sunburnt in the first place.

“He will get sunburnt today,” said Ben Wallace, who also does something in an office each day.

Just not today, that is.

“I remember Matt getting sunburnt last summer at the Sailing Club Christmas Party. We sat out on the deck all day and drank. I’m pretty sure we both got heatstroke that day. Anyway, bottom line is, Matt’s skin will be all over his bedroom next week.”

Only time will tell if Matt receives a sunburnt or not.

The Advocate reached out to the Cancer Council for comment and received a swift and prompt reply.

In a statement issued moments ago, the Council stated categorically for the record that if you’re going out in the sun, please be sun smart.

“Put a shirt on, SPF 50+ sunscreen next then please put a hat on. There’s nothing healthy about a tan,”

“Everybody can get burned by the sun. Everybody.”

This is a developing story.

Kiwi Shot Putter Barnaby Joyce Qualifies For Commonwealth Games

TEXT:

New Zealand’s shot put medal hopes have been put firmly on the shoulders of Barnaby Joyce, as he qualified for the event this afternoon in Auckland.

Joyce, who supports his athletic career by moonlighting as Australia’s Deputy Prime Minister, is reportedly both ‘chuffed’ and ‘fucking stoked’ to represent his father’s birthplace in the upcoming Gold Coast Commonwealth Games.

“Should be a great little footnote to what’s been a great career,” he said.

“I’m confident I can take gold, as well. There’s a Jamaican bloke and this dude from Scotland I might need to worry about but yeah, should shit it in, thanks for asking,”

“Anyway, I thought I was in a bit of curry when I renounced my Kiwi citizenship to get my old job back, that they wouldn’t let me compete but the New Zealand Olympic Committee is surprisingly chill about the whole thing. Anyway, up Aotearoa! No ghost chips for me.”

Never the less, many of Joyce’s parliamentary colleagues were at first upset and angered at the move but ultimately resigned that this isn’t the strangest thing The National Party has done in recent memory.

The Advocate spoke to the Prime Minister a short time ago about the announcement.

“It is what it is,” said Malcolm Turnbull as he shrugged.

“What can I do? Tell him not to? I’ve already lost interest. I might even go to Golden Plains with Richard Di Natalie when it’s on. Just have a few days sitting in a teepee thinking about things. But yeah, I wish him the best of luck.”

Guest Who Brought Terrible Beer To NYE BBQ Seen Drinking Everything But It

TEXT:

Having mates around for an NYE barbeque is a tradition that runs through the veins of every Australian, as is the knowledge that you always bring at least a six-pack of beer that you intend to drink. However, at a Betoota Grove barbeque yesterday afternoon, one out-of-towner seemed to have a brain snap and break every value that we hold dear.

Canberran, Richard Whitlam (29), showed up to local man Brett Ragg’s barbeque with four loose 375ml bottles of Toohey’s Extra Dry, possibly the most disgusting alcoholic beverage produced by the Tooheys company.

Multiple witnesses at the barbeque report that, not only did Richard bring TEDs, but he did not so much as look at one of his “bottles of dog piss [sic]” since placing them in someone else’s Esky.

The Advocate caught up with the avoidable chorus of victims who were more than happy to express their disdain for Richard from Canberra.

“He sure liked the taste of my Crownies, the prick. They’re not cheap, you know.”

“And he wasn’t shy on the VB tubes I brought, either!”

“Yeah, I even saw him sucking down a couple of me passionfruit UDL’s!”

Brett was reluctant to reveal why he invited Richard to his barbeque in the first place, however, it’s now understood that Richard is an old school friend of Brett’s and he was obliged to invite him, as Richard was holidaying solo in the Diamantina region.

The Advocate can confirm that following the barbeque, the only beers remaining in the Esky were, not surprisingly, the four Tooheys Extra Dries brought by Richard.

Father-Of-The-Bride Reminds Wedding Guests That He Paid For Everything

TEXT:

According to Mark Rogers, somebody always has to pay because nothing in this world comes free.

Today, the person who pays is him.

Despite saving a bit of money by having their wedding on a Thursday, Julie (nee Rogers) and Sam Heshan still wanted the nuptials of their dreams.

Which is a bit more expensive than applying for a marriage license at the French Quarter Local Courts.

“Julie said she wanted this that and the other thing for her wedding,” he said.

“Who am I to say no? I’m so old and fucked now that avoiding intrafamily conflict with money is a seemingly wise investment. Want a horse and buggy? Fuck it, put it on my Amex. I don’t care anymore,”

“All I asked for was to bring some friends and time to speak. Getting that was like getting AB- from a fucking blood bank in Basra.”

So shortly after the Best Man concluded his widely inappropriate speech, Old Man Rogers creaked, groaned and cracked his way upright and over to the lectern.

He prefaced his speech by telling the wedding guests that he paid for everything, which means they should at least remain silent while he’s talking.

That was met with a few laughs and a long pause while Mark retired his service station reading glasses from the inside pocket of his dinner jacket.

“Now,” he said.

“[My 2018 Resolution] Was A Bit Unrealistic” Says Man With Burger Ring Dust In His Bed

TEXT:

A fine film of dust on Justin Cole’s recently purchased gym membership has signalled the beginning of the end for the social media executive, whose ‘new year, new me’ mantra is in disarray barely 24 hours into 2018.

The 27-year-old former flanker had the shock of his life when he couldn’t zip up his once snug size 38 G-Star Raw jeans, instead forced to meet the lads at the local in ruggers that left little to the imagination.

Cole’s gradual weight gain forced his long-time girlfriend, Mary Hope, to buy him a not-so-subtle Fitness First membership for Christmas.

Things started promisingly for the one-time stud muffin, but after two days of rabbit food and one brutal cardio session at his local gym at the top of Struggle Street, the excuses started flooding in as Cole started to relapse hard.

“I pulled up really sore on the 28th [of December] so I couldn’t go to the gym,” he said.

“I then had Damo’s birthday and I couldn’t say no to wings night on the Saturday. I set myself a limit for New Year’s, but let’s be realistic; I’m only human.”

The loose unit split a case of Betoota’s finest ale with Damo before impressing the other partygoers with his stunning takedown of eight Jager Bombs before the midnight fireworks.

While his drinking brightened up the mood at the couple-dominated event in the swanky suburb of Betoota Grove, his fellow guests were shocked by his vacuum-like powers in the kitchen as he polished off seven lamb skewers and five sausages without so much as looking at the salad Ms Hope had prepared earlier that day.

Hope, who was on call at the hospital that night, returned from her nursing shift the following morning to find her boyfriend passed out surrounded by Burger Rings crumbs.

“I used to be the envy of all the other girlfriends when he was captain of thirds,” she said with a pang of disappointment in her voice.

“Now I feel embarrassed to take photos with him. The jealous comments have dried up and the likes have dwindled on my Facebook posts…don’t even get me started on Instagram. They don’t have a filter to fix up that fat mess.”

Corporate Drone Back At Work Already Feels Cheated

TEXT:

The warm fuzzy feeling that Simon Clarke was supposed to get when his boss told him, ‘you’re doing a real good job by starting early,’ has been predictably vacant.

He was the only person dressed in a suit this morning as he rode the D45 into the Financial District from his seemingly overpriced and filthy French Quarter off-the-plan apartment.

That wasn’t a good sign, he thought.

The 31-year-old told The Advocate that he was the only person in the office today, which gave him the rare privilege of taking two hours for lunch and the ability to walk around the office without shoes on.

“Doing the latter would’ve put my head on the chopping block,” he said.

“But as I’m alone today in the office, it’s basically mufti day. As fun as it is to break arbitrary workplace rules, I can’t help but feel cheated today,”

“All of my mates are still out on the coast. Mate, even the fucking coffee shop downstairs doesn’t reopen until the 8th. And for some reason, the Betoota Stock Exchange is open for trading today. Any bets on what the volume will be today? I reckon we won’t even crack a mil today in turnover. Waste of time if you ask me.”

From there, the private asset manager said he’d be taking things quite easy this afternoon.

He plans to field calls from the elderly white men who’ve entrusted Clarke to manage their portfolios, telling them that cryptocurrencies are just a fad and that they should keep their faith in the ASX 200.

Unread Copy Of Fight Club Still Looks Cool On 19-Year-Old’s Book Shelf

TEXT:

Uni student and aspiring P-plater, Arthur Wickens (19) takes great pride in the presentation of his dorm room.

The centrepiece of which is a copy of Chuck Palahniuk’s 1996 transgressive fiction novel, Fight Club, which looks really cool, even though Wickens has not read it yet.

“I got it in a second-hand bookshop. It’s got the original cover before the movie came out. Seminal, isn’t it?”

Speaking exclusively with The Advocate we asked Wickens about the primary differences between the film and book versions of Fight Club.

Wickens joked “Well the film has Brad Pitt!” before showing us the other features in his room such as his Bob Marley flag and empty bottles of all the foreign beers he has drunk.

Ultimately, Wickens admitted to The Advocate that he had not actually read Fight Club, confirming rumours circulated by Wicken’s Dungeon Master, Jesse Meek.

“Apparently, masculinity is a big theme in the book so, we don’t need to bring one another down and I don’t need to act cool to impress people. Even if this copy of Fight Club makes me look cool.”

Despite not having read the book, Wickens says just owning a copy that is visible in his dorm room has had a massive effect on his life.

“D’you know, I’m just a different, cooler guy now. Thinking maybe I’ll even start my own Fight Club and tell everyone I know about it to raise awareness!”

Father-In-Law Emasculatingly Relieves BBQ Tongs From Man’s Grip

TEXT:

When his friends describe him, Graham Goodridge is often toted as being a no-frills man.

They assured The Advocate that a sense of humour lay within the 66-year-old former British Marine, it just lays dormant most of the time.

That’s something Mark Donoghue had to learn the hard way.

He started courting Graham’s daughter well over a decade ago and has yet to receive an inch from his father-in-law.

Conch Goodridge and Mark married on the same day winter Olympian Torah Bright won silver in the women’s halfpipe event at Sochi; it was a stinking hot day Royal Betoota Golf Club where they exchanged vowels and signed the registry.

Mark turned to Graham after the celebrant made it official and made a joke.

“I said, as a joke, ‘I’ve got the Conch!’ as a nod to Lord Of The Flies,” recalled Mark this afternoon.

“And then Graham just looked at me with daggers. Like he’d just ran into an Argentine soldier in the dead of night on West Falkland again. Anyway, I guess it was a bad joke. That pales in comparison to what happened to me today, however.”

Mark and Conch had her parent’s over for a barbeque lunch today at their leafy Betoota Heights Californian Bungalow.

Though now Mark wishes he’d just taken them to a nice lunch.

“We planned to have a barbeque, a few steaks and kebabs. Grilled eggplant for Conch. Everything was going along fine. The Betoota Bitter was cold and that grumpy old fuck Graham seemed mellow enough,”

“I was wrong. He came up behind me while I was pouring beer on the grill plate and pulled the tongs from my hand. Never in my life have I wanted to shrivel up and die more.”

Taking charge of the barbeque, Graham looked Mark up and down then let out a sigh.

“Take that fucking apron off, you idiot,” he said.

“Jumping Jesus, you’ve burnt the corn. It’s not even fit for the dog bucket, you’ll fuck its guts if you feed him that corn, you will. Go and put that strong jawline to good use and get me another beer.”

Mark smiled, about-faced and walked back into the house.

Bitcoin Is A Bubble According To Ageing Property Investor

TEXT:

Confidence in Bitcoin and “all that cryptocurrency shit” has been dealt a significant blow today, as it was verbally slammed by a local baby boomer.

Betoota Groves resident Anthony Wilson (73), told The Advocate that the “whole thing is a friggen con. A fraud (sic). A bubble. And it’s gonna burst.”

Wilson assured us that his deep loathing of cryptocurrency doesn’t stem from the fact that he has no understanding of the technology or the way the market works, but from the fact, he knows a bubble when he sees one.

While the hype around Bitcoin continues to grow, much alike it’s price, many have felt the need to vocally discredit the virtual currency.

As each coin now sits at over $20,000 a pop, the merits in the argument that it is inflated (much like the current Australian property market perhaps) are strong.

Wilson, who owns two units in the French Quarter and a couple of rentals in Brisbane said that property is where his money is safe.

“Forget the fact that supply is set to far outweigh demand, interest rates are at record lows and the government will soon be forced to act on housing affordability by tightening up foreign investment, the housing market is definitely not a bubble,” he said.

Local Bitcoin investor Sam Linus laughed when we told him about Wilson’s comments.

“Yeah fucking. Funny how all these old cunts who have all their money tied up in property or traditional investment schemes are dead certain that Bitcoin won’t last.”

“Hmmmmmm I wonder why people like the head of JPMorgan Chase are so adamantly trying to discredit it, maybe because they feel threatened? If it’s so dumb and people are pissing their money away why are they wasting any time on it?”

Linus raised the recent GFC, where he says his father lost all of his super, as a recent example of why current financial figures may not exactly be the fountain of knowledge.

“Oh, and remember when Bitcoin hit $1000 at the start of the year? Yeah, it was gonna burst then remember?”

“Look fellas don’t get me wrong. I think Bitcoin is very overvalued at the moment, I don’t know if it can stay at this price going forward, but I struggle to keep my tongue when all these boomers start telling me all this shit. There is a reason why Russia is looking into making its own cryptocurrency. Why Amex wants to patent a blockchain. Why CME is trading futures. ”

The Betoota Advocate Interviews Will Smith

TEXT:

As the sweltering holiday months approach us, it’s a very busy time of the year for the popular international streaming service Netflix, who were kind enough to invite The Betoota Advocate editors Clancy Overell and Errol Parker to their Australian press junket for their new original movie Bright, starring Will Smith (USA) and Joel Edgerton (Blacktown).

The fantasy crime movie is directed by David Ayer (Suicide Squad) with a script by Max Landis (American Ultra). This is Will Smith’s first time taking a decent internet-era paycheck and deciding to star in a Netflix project – and in true Will Smith fashion, he’s chosen a buddy cop film with a splash of supernatural villains and protagonists.

Bright is set in a world where humans and fantasy creatures coexist. Will Smith plays an American police officer (again) but this time, instead of Martin Lawrence – his partner is an Orc (played by Edgerton), two run-of-the-mill  cops find a very powerful magic wand that has the potential to change the world.

Will Smith, formerly known as Big Willy Smith, the Hollywood star was promoting his upcoming Netflix sci-thriller Bright along with his co-star Joel Edgerton and director David Ayer.

While Netflix executives promised we would have a sit down with Will Smith, it appeared that the Will Smith we sat down with sounded a lot like a suburban Brisbanite, we put this down to him working closely with the Australian costars.

However, the actor, 49, was in high spirits at the back end of the international tour.

It was clear to our editors that he didn’t look himself – possibly due to his gruelling itinerary – however he proved himself to be the same old Will that Australia fell in love with on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons on Channel 7.

Thrifty Uni Student Explains You Can Get Quite A Bit For 30 Bucks At Self Serve Checkout

TEXT:

A popular student at South Betoota Polytechnic College has revealed a particularly useful lifehack to The Advocate this afternoon

That lifehack is the trick of getting a whole weeks’ worth of groceries at Coles for just $30.

William McQuade doesn’t use special coupons – or purchase stuff that’s about to go off.

He uses one simple, easy trick.

That trick is just manipulating the self-serve checkouts at the popular supermarket chain, or as some may call it, petty theft.

“Yeah, it’s pretty fucking easy mate. Avocados? I just weigh them as unwashed potatoes. Steak? Jam that shit into a mushroom bag and put it through as brown onions” he explained.

“It’s easy as.”

McQuade said it’s incredible how far $30 bucks can go.

“The other day, I managed to get a saucepan, a new 3 pack of Bonds undies, and some nice chocolates on top of my groceries as well.”

When we asked the 21-year-old about whether he saw it as criminal theft, he told us that he has some moral justification.

“Mate, I grew up out bush. Coles fucking rip off farmers every day of the year. I’m just getting some of it back. It’s not like I am thieving from Antonio’s little fruit store on anything. These big supermarket chains are pricks. Plus the cunts pay fuck all tax as well. This is the William tax.”

Our reporters contacted Coles for comment and they told us that while they detest the amount of stock these students are swindling, they save so much money by not hiring people that it doesn’t really matter in the end.

“We have a duopoly mate. We make a killing anyway. It’s nice to catch some of these smartarse kids but in the long run, the house always wins.” they said.

Commuter On Hot Packed Train Wonders If It’s All Going To Be Worth It In The End

TEXT:

Another Monday, another late and crowed 7:34 am service on the Betoota MetroLine service into the Old City District.

Denise Susans hit snooze enough times this morning to find herself without a seat and pressed up against the door.

“I’m usually on the earlier train,” she said defeatedly.

“But I think there’s some trackwork or something. Apparently, there was a sandstorm last night and the Grosvenor Street station copped it,”

“Ah well. I guess I can try to read my book between those deep moments of introspection staring out the window, feeling as if my life is passing by just as fast as the trees are past the window.”

It is in those existential minutes that the 28-year-old wonders if it’s all going to be worth it in the end.

Spear-headed by a quality education at a nice, selective government school. Forged by tertiary qualifications from an institution were gum trees were planed by choice, not by geography.

At times, life was difficult growing up but never unmanageable.

Seemingly significant problems and challenges overcome previously pale in comparison to those she faces now.

“I just need a sign that I’m not just treading water out here in the desert,” she said.

“Everybody else seems to have it all sorted out. Sometimes, I feel like I’m drowning in life. Was it all worth it? The work I’ve done and sacrifices my family made to get me to where I am? Even my own sacrifices? I don’t know and it’s killing me,”

“Jesus Christ, I must’ve had a big weekend if this is what I’m thinking about on the train to work on a Monday.”

The MetroLine train then came to a halt between two stations and the guard did his melancholy duty to inform the passengers that there was yet another delay.

No Activity Remake Confirms American Cops Also Talk Shit

TEXT:

Australia and the USA have always enjoyed a long-standing friendship. Bonding over Australia’s eagerness to follow America into whichever conflict takes their fancy in a particular decade and recent surges of far-right activists. However nothing has brought the two closer together than the realisation that both nations can identify with a pair of low ranking detectives who talk shit on the job.

Stan’s No Activity is the Australian sitcom featuring drawn out and humorous conversations (normally about fuck all) between police detective’s, dispatch officers and clueless criminals.

Star of the US series JK Simmons said that the idea of a US remake was exciting for him due to the cultural similarities of police and criminal culture between the two nations, and the atrocious amount of money he was offered to feature init.

“It makes perfect sense really. Some of the shit US cops get away with…crikey [that’s what you guys say isn’t it?]. They haven’t even bothered recasting Patrick Brammall, that’s how similar the stereotype is!”

Simmons says he conducted a day of field research with members of the Queensland Police Force and was surprised by how much time he spent perfectly relaxed and comfortable.

“Was almost the same as when I did it in the States but with Ice Coffee instead of Dr Pepper.”

With some changes made between the Australian and US versions of No Activity, Simmons says Australian’s will be pleasantly surprised by subtle differences between the two cultures, yet comforted by the multitude of similarities.

“The only major difference I guess is that over there your cops shoot way less people than ours. But the whole sitting around giving each other shit thing is almost identical.”

“Some Australians may be shocked to learn the US police stereotype of doughnuts isn’t so much of a thing as it was. Their cops hit up Maccas just as much as ours! More if anything!”

Two-Star Health Rating On Bacon & Egg Pie Not About To Deter Local Rare Unit From Buying Them

TEXT:

John ‘Stagecoach’ Pettiford is a complex man with simple needs.

He drinks when he’s dry and eats when he’s hungry.

This afternoon, the 28-year-old was just starving.

On the walk home from his local MetroLine stop in Betoota’s fabled Danish Town, the fourth-grade Dolphins co-captain popped into his local føtex to see what caught his eye for dinner.

Enter a four-pack of bacon and egg pies and a box of instant mash.

Stagecoach timidly approached the freezer section like a man approaching a wild stallion, intent on breaking it in.

He opened the glass door and looked down at the box.

“Hmmmm,” he murmured.

“Two-stars is a bit how ya going, even for me. Maybe if I jazz it up with some broccoli or something it won’t give me colon cancer. They do look delicious,”

“Hmmmm.”

It didn’t take long for John to convince himself that a few pies, mash potato and a whole head of boiled broccoli isn’t actually that unhealthy.

Smiling to himself as he walked through the front door of his rented one bedroom apartment, he kissed his fiance, Rachael Rooney, on the top of the head as she sat watching Millionaire Hot Seat in the living room.

When asked what he had planned for dinner, Rach wasn’t quite ready for the reply.

“I’m having these,” he said, lifting the frozen pies up for her to see.

“I got some instant mash and broccoli as well. I got you some microwave brown rice and salmon, just like you asked.”

Rach then went back to watching Eddie McGuire and let out a long sigh.

Around an hour later, they sat watching the news as they slowly ate their dinners.

“These are actually pretty good,” he said.

“Do you want a bite?”

Rachael considered having one briefly then smiled and said yes.

“They taste like a quiche,” she said.

“A bad quiche.”

Instagram Model Not Sure Why Photo Of Her Goofy Long-Term Boyfriend Didn’t Do Too Well

TEXT:

A Betoota-based Instagram influencer / entrepreneur has today been left feeling underwhelmed, after learning that a photo of her long-term boyfriend doesn’t do as well as a photo of her in lingerie

Alexis Rose, a 22-year-old non-agency model says she is bewildered by the response from her fan base.

“I thought they were honestly invested in Lexi as a human being, not just a product” she says, awkwardly referring to herself, as a brand, in third person.

“I just wanted to fill them in on the life – and introduce them to Jason.”

“Just so they know who it is behind the camera…”

“Haha just another day in the life of Lexi”

The photo, which shows her goofy arse boyfriend Jason eating breakfast like an idiot, was even captioned in a way that made him look like a little bitch.

“Breakfast with this one” writes the caption, in a daring debut of that loser that everyone instinctively hates because they are jealous of him.

The photo has garnered less than 1000 likes, a personal low for lexi.

“I just don’t get it, Jase looks so good in this pic”

This isn’t the first time Alexis has been left surprised by the follower base, in November last year she was shocked to find out that the 52.2k Instagram users, of mostly teenage boys and tradesmen, weren’t too interested in her opinion on the Trump election. It was her first and last political post

Cyclist Attempting To Balance Until The Lights Turn Green Not Impressing Anyone

TEXT:

Winding the passenger window down in his early 2000s Hilux, Conor Beattie leered across the bench seat and gave a local cyclist a good spray.

“Just put ya hoof down, you clip-clopping wanker!” he yelled.

“And buy a car, fuck face!”

And with that, Conor was off in a plume of rich blue exhaust fumes.

The polite, happy-go-lucky cyclist on the receiving end of Mr Beattie’s triad was Edward Lloyd.

Lloyd owns a small collection of $400 suits and works at Bell Potter Betoota, the McDonalds of private wealth management – and that’s about it. He also owns a very expensive bicycle that he uses to commute from his boutique Old City district apartment to the converted French Quarter townhouse where he works.

But that’s not all.

The 29-year-old financier is rumoured to be single-handedly keeping the local Patagonia shop open in Betoota Heights. On the weekends, there’s not a bike trail or hiking path safe from his Instagram followers.

He spoke to The Advocate this morning about his first and only love – cycling.

“The reason why I try to balance at the lights is because I wear clip-ons,” he said, athletically.

“I get yelled at a lot, though. Once at the lights, I couldn’t keep my balance so I put my hand on the boot of this Falcon in front of me. The man inside didn’t like that and he got out to confront me – and confront me he did, with a length of reo bar!”

“He tried to wrap it around my head, telling me to ‘pay fucking rego’ and ‘get in the bike land’ which are both controversial ideas for a planet saver such as myself. Oh well, I guess!”

Our reporter then paid for the flat white and macchiato and left Pisse Dans Ma Poche without saying goodbye.

Shopper Stumbles Across Chainsaw She Didn’t Know She Needed In Aldi’s ‘Aisle Of Dreams’

TEXT:

We all have weaknesses.

Gambling is a vice for some. Drinking for others. Some may struggle with a shopping addiction.

Maddie Gibson is one such person who grapples with shopping addiction, but her shopping habit is a slightly peculiar one.

Her weakness is Aldi’s fabled “Aisle of Dreams.”

The Aisle of Dreams is the middle section of the supermarket, Aldi, where anything from ski clothing to chainsaws can be found.

Maddie says she faces a weekly battle trying to avoid spending far more money on the groceries than she needs to.

“The aisle of dreams gets me every single time. I go to Aldi for my cheap groceries and that’s great, but the other week I ended up coming home with a lolly dispenser, a Lazy Susan and a ski jacket,” she said.

“My boyfriend has resigned himself to the inevitable now. He doesn’t even get angry when I get some random german cooking appliance. Every now and then he gets a nice treat like some undies, or a new tent.”

Maddie’s boyfriend Karl Major confirmed to us today that he actually doesn’t berate her, because he too, secretly loves the Aisle of Dreams.

“I like doing the shopping now. If she was going to Coles or Woolies I would find some excuse not to come. But Aldi, that’s a whole different kettle of fish. I got a fucking circular saw there the other day. I’ll probably never use it, but fuck, it was like 29 bucks.”

When we contacted Aldi for comment, they revealed to us secret market research behind the significance of the aisle.

A spokesperson informed us that “The middle aisle is where we make all the money. We lure people in with the cheap groceries and then clean them out on all sorts of random shit they didn’t know they needed. It’s like what Woolies does with all those chocolates and drinks near the check out.”

Half-Hearted Plans To Hit The Gym After Work Used To Justify 3pm Kit Kat Chunky

TEXT:

After a health kick that has involved bi-weekly visits to the gym, HR Manager Lynne Porter (51) has decided to preemptively reward her healthy efforts with a 3 pm KitKat Chunky.

“I’ve been good today. Nutri Grain for breakfast and caesar salad for lunch. I’m going to the gym later, I need my blood sugar up!”

Following a brief look at the nutritional information, Porter decided she would be able to work around the 207 calories and 10 grams of fat in her KitKat Chunky multipack.

“That’s only 10% of my calories and I’m having half now half later so that’s healthier. And I’m going to the gym probably so that will cancel it out.”

According to those close to her, Porter has taken more liberties with her diet since joining the gym and brags loudly about eating salads every lunch time.

“Problem is though, I’m still hungry after I have one. So yeah, once in a while I might have a bit of a snacko to curb my 3:30-itis.”

“Doesn’t matter because I think I’ll make it to the gym tonight.”

Far from hindering her progress, Porter claims the odd chocolate based treat pushes her to go harder at the gym.

“When you’re my age, your metabolism is slower than an old Newcastle fan making his way to an away game. The sugar kickstarts that and pushes me to cycle even harder on the what-do-you-call-it, bike machine thing.”

“You Can’t Say Anything These Days” Says Man Who Says Whatever He Wants All The Time

TEXT:

According to Nathan Fish (64) political correctness is ruining his life making it hard for him to speak his mind, despite the fact he does anyway literally all of the time.

“Did you hear you can’t even say ‘wog’ anymore? So if I see someone acting like a wog I’m not allowed to say it even though my grandma was half Macedonian?”

A veteran of far-right media, including websites and radio stations that spend more time discussing Social Justice Warrior culture than Tumblr, Fish say’s he’s had it up to here with political correctness, despite the fact he’s never even tried it.

“My niece got mad at me cause I told her to “never do business with a Leb.” So I’m not supposed to say that now huh? Fine then love, go ahead ignore my advice, see how that works out for you then.”

Fish believes that trigger warnings and safe spaces are what is wrong with this country and the reason that young people today will not grow up into hardened, bitter divorcees like himself.

“Did you know a man can just become a chick now but you’re not supposed to call them a ‘shim?’ Literal soft cocks mate.”

According to Fish, ‘these snowflakes’ need to take a good hard look at themselves, citing one incident where he was called a ‘stupid cracker’ on social media.

“Not that’s offensive. How is that ok but me asking “when is white history month?” just not on? Hypocrite sharia law loving fuckwits, fuck em!”

Fish denies claims that he is a racist as he once had his front window replaced by an Asian man.

“I didn’t even complain when he answered his phone talking Chinese. Speaks it better than he speaks English anyway that’s for sure.”

Dad Helps Kids Make Lost Signs For 19-Year-Old Dead-Blind Pet That’s Very Dead

TEXT:

Recently, Betoota locals have become aware of the Davidson family’s missing dog, Coco, through a series of ‘Lost’ posters that have blanketed the town. At 19 years old, Coco is a beloved Betoota personality whose disappearance has upset many of the locals.

However, for Coco’s owner Hugh Davidson (35) the topic of their lost dog is one he’d sheepishly rather not discuss.

“The kid’s made the posters, I couldn’t say no…”

Last week, Davidson took the 19-year-old fox terrier to the vet to have her humanely put down and save it the suffering of the 27 types of cancer she was succumbing too.

“How do you explain that to a kid? I thought it would be easier to say she ran away but now I think it’s gone too far.”

Since the Davidson kids taped their ‘Lost Dog’ posters to every telegraph pole in Betoota, many locals have offered the family their support, some have even gone looking Coco in order to claim the $1000 reward.

“Yeah, I set it at $1000. What does it matter? Don’t tell the kids but there’s no reward in the world that’s gonna bring Coco back.”

Davidson’s wife, Lorna Davidson (33) says it’s only a matter of time before the kids figure out the truth.

“Coco was 19 years old which is 133 in dog years. She was deaf and basically couldn’t see a thing. Surely the idea that she is out roaming the streets waiting to run under the wheels of a semi-trailer would be scarier for the kids?”

According to Lorna Davidson, her husband has made this type of mistake before and worries how her husband is planning to eventually deal with the situation. For now, Hugh Davidson hopes it will work itself out.

“They won’t be young forever, soon they’ll realise they put these posters up for nothing. Maybe I’ll chuck it in when they realise Santa isn’t real.”

Authorities Plead With Victorian Gun Owners To Not Shoot At “Major Weather Event” This Weekend

TEXT:

Just months after Floridanese police and sheriff departments had to ask citizens to not shoot at Hurricane Irma, a similar situation is currently unfolding in Victoria where thousands of gun owners plan to shoot the impending bad weather away.

Owners of Victorian shotgun, centre and rimfire rifle, as well as a few handgun owners, have vowed to make a stand against what the Bureau of Meteorology is calling a “big storm”.

Speaking to The Advocate this afternoon via telephone, one Ararat shotgun owner said he will do his best to stop the storm before it does too much damage.

“I went down the Elders this afternoon and bought me some shells,” said Rhett Bong, a 47-year-old workman.

“Also got some castor oil, polony and a few loaves of bread. I’m going to live like a king and shoot this got dam fucking cloud back to the Artic where the somabitch come from,”

“Fuck you John Brumby! Muthafucka [sic] not laughing now! Praise be upon Ricky Muir, the merciful and kind, ya’ll. Woolooloooo!”

However, Mr Bong said he and the other gun owning members of his community will not be swayed by the authorities and their calls to not shoot the inclement weather.

“Fuck them, too!”

A spokesman for the Victorian Police Force explained to The Advocate that if any gun owner feels the need to discharge a firearm in public, their staff will promptly shoot back on behalf of the storm.

“If you would like to die this weekend, shoot at the clouds in a public space,” said the spokesman.

“We have a very low tolerance for gun-related horseplay in the country for obvious reasons so do not try us.”

Study: Going Bushwalking On The Weekend Makes You Better Than Everyone

TEXT:

Peter Gynt and Alexa Conch are great people.

The both have rewarding careers and enjoying the simpler things in life.

From time to time, they volunteer their time at various local charities in the rough, mildly dangerous Betoota Ponds area.

One time they went there, Peter stepped on a syringe but luckily it only had a bit of heroin in it.

But it’s the weekend where they take time out for themselves. They drive out beyond the North Betoota City Limits and hike the many trails through the Remienko State Forrest.

They’ve been doing that for weeks now – but what they used to do is a matter of controversy.

Prior to getting into the outdoors each weekend, the popular couple used to hit the French Quarter bars and clubs with friends. Dancing the night away with a cocktail of drugs and alcohol coursing through their veins, they were young, wild and free.

But one Sunday morning, they decided to make a change.

“I didn’t want to live like that anymore,” said Alexa, a local geologist at the Carnegie Uranium mine near Betoota Downs.

“Every Sunday morning, I’d wake feeling like ants were crawling over my brain. A thirst that felt unquenchable at times. It was a horrible time to be alive,”

“Peter felt the same way I did, conveniently, so we made a change.”

And with that, they instantly became better than all their friends who still licked the top of nightclub toilets of a Saturday evening.

Instantly better than their friends who still came home too drunk to put their key in the door come Friday night.

After learning that our reporter was still one of those vapid, soulless drug addicts that float around dark rooms with loud, blaring music, the couple rolled their eyes and concluded the interview.

North Betoota physio, Shelley Bennet, hasn’t offered much explanation in the caption – but the sonograph that was made by sending pulses of ultrasound into her tissue has all but confirmed that she’s only going to have one glass of wine over Christmas.

While it is not yet known if the prenatal viviparous organism present in this sonogram was actually planned, it’s appearance on Facebook has garnered Shel more social media attention than anything she’s ever posted before.

“It’s doing better than that risqué shot I posted when I was in Brazil in 2015” she says.

“I’m not even it”

Complete with the caption “…and then there was three” – the Facebook post hit triple figures within the hour, and analysts says that Shel and her partner Ed are looking good for a possible 400-liker.

“We made an executive call to only post it from Facebook account” says Shel.

“That way we are splitting traction. Plus, I’ve got more Facebook friends than Ed anyway”

When asked for comment about the big news, Ed asked if we knew anyone who’d be interested in buying his two-seater Mazda RX-7.

“Yeah… Gotta suck it up and go looking for a Subaru” he said.

“Deadset, if you know anyone who’s interested it’s got a whole year’s rego on it”

Shel says she’ll try her very best to not continue chasing this kind of social media gratification, but admits that it will be hard staying at home alone over the next few months.

Normal Joke Made Funnier By Will Ferrell Yelling It

TEXT:

With a lack of innovation and excessive claims of sexual assault plaguing the comedy industry, fans and comics alike are comforted by Will Ferrell’s loud delivery of an already funny joke.

Known for his high-brow performances where he fights a female co-worker and rubs his testicles on a drum-kit, Will Ferrell’s greatest contribution to the comedy world has undoubtedly been his ability to make a normal joke much funnier by yelling it.

Speaking exclusively to The Advocate Ferrell refused to answer if he’d be bringing his signature gusto to his performance in the remake of No Activity with some of his microphone breaking volume.

Film critic David Stratton says there is much more to Ferrell’s delivery than higher decibels.

“What you have is a joke delivered quite loudly obviously, but it’s wrapped in a sort of dramatic desperation that vanishes as quickly as it appears giving this sense of an adult tantrum which very much plays to his appearance as an overgrown man child.”

In 2014, reports circulated that Will Ferrell once had an entire church congregation in stitches by reading the eulogy of a dear friend at a volume much higher than is usually acceptable.

Confirming these rumours, Minister D.D. Jackson states that he let typical funeral convention slide just this once.

“I was going to get up and tell him to stop but [tehehehe] he’s just so funny! The way he talks so loud, oh man.”

Stratton said that considering the character Ferrell plays in the series he can’t see anything changing. 

“He plays a middle aged American father-in-law. If were are expecting Ferrell to ever step away from the high volume, in your face white america, this show probably won’t be the one he does it in.” 

When pressed on whether he would bring his typical humour to the table in the new series, Ferrell finally responded with;

“YOU’LL JUST HAVE TO WATCH IT TO FIND OUT!!”

Haha! So good.

Peculiar Older Male Teacher At Private School All Of A Sudden No Longer Spoken About

TEXT:

A bizarre older man that has spent several decades teaching at local private school has been removed from his role and is no longer spoken about, it has been confirmed.

The school has not clarified whether or not it was retirement, or a forced resignation, but they have said that he is no longer teaching there and aren’t really willing to say anymore than that.

“We have a new teacher now” said a spokesperson for the school.

“She is a prominent school teacher from another prestigious school like ours. Students, this is your new teacher. Say hello to your new teacher”

In fact, the only reminder of this peculiar old man’s tenure as an educational professional is the odd photo of him as a low grade middle school basketball coach in the school year books.

Students aren’t exactly sure what happened to Mr Shardlaw, but they have a pretty good idea.

“Yeah, we always thought he might have been a bit… You know” says one high schooler.

“Surprised it didn’t happened sooner to be honest”

It is not yet known if the termination of Mr Shardlaw’s employment and subsequent removal from the honour boards of the iconic Christian college may have something to do with a current government inquiry, but students have been urged to continue life as normal.

Gaming Community Concede Pixelated Strippers In Duke Nukem Are Hard To Top

TEXT:

After two decades of rapid developments in CGI, one local gamer has realised that not much gets his blood pumping the same way the heavily pixelated strippers in the 1996 PC game Duke Nukem 3D did.

A recent report by the ACMA has found that the entire Australian gaming community has never been able to get over these particular female extras, even after the release of several games which literally show protagonists having sex.

Even after experimenting with a range of drugs, the 32-year-old IT consultant, Joseph Madden says he just can’t find the same thrills he experienced while secretly flirting with the animated pole dancers at 13 years old.

“It was so good” Joe.

“Man, I had the hot air blowing out of the Windows desktop into my family computer room, with my foot stretch out trying to hold the door shut so mum couldn’t see the perverted content on the screen”

As a first-person shooter game similar to Doom, the gameplay of Duke Nukem 3D involves moving through levels presented from the protagonist’s point of view, shooting enemies on the way. The environments in Duke Nukem 3D are highly destructible and interactive; most props can be destroyed by the player – including the strippers.

“I accidentally exploded a couple strippers with a grenade once” said Joe.

“I really couldn’t forgive myself for that. I made sure I was always very courteous to female game characters from that point on, even the sex workers”

Pushover Reaches Point In Relationship Where He’s Trusted To Buy His Own Clothes

In a word, Peter Granger is ‘chuffed.’

For a number of years now, the 31-year-old hasn’t been trusted to select and purchase his own clothes because according to his partner, he’s got the ‘taste of a tongueless drunk.’

But this morning, Granger confidently strode into the South Betoota Rivers Megastore and chose a few pairs of jeans and a nice shirt for himself.

“When people talk about trust, this is what they’re talking about,” he said.

“Kitty, the love of my life, said to stay away from the pre-damaged and stonewash jeans. Printed button-up shirts are also off limits. So in the end, I got a swish pair of tube jeans with a deep, blue denim plus a polo shirt that just a little bit too small,”

“All in all, I think I did a good job. Hope I did, anyway. The whole ensemble cost me $4.56 so I don’t think she can return anything in good conscience.”

Speaking candidly to The Advocate, Kitty Pitchman said Peter did a fine job choosing his own clothes today and he might get a special reward tonight for his effort.

“I’m going to cook him his favourite dinner, which is also the state dish of Queensland,” she said.

“A bowl of potato gems lathered in smokey BBQ with a side of lime-flavoured Aeroplane Jelly.”

Millennial Miraculously Survives The Ride to Work Without Headphones

TEXT:

Forgetting his PelicanPass for the second time this week, one local city worker sighed heavily and went over to buy a single ride from the ticket window.

The line up at the Windrower Avenue Station ticket window is always long and Michael Ponting simply didn’t have time for it – the 8:02 to the Old City District was fast approaching the platform.

So he jogged lightly up to the turnstiles and with great difficulty, vaulted the turnstiles and boarded the train.

Though many Betoota MetroLine employees saw him do it, not one of them cared enough about their job to stop him.

But once he was safe inside the rear carriage, he went to put his headphones in and tune out for the 20 minutes it takes to head into town.

But to his horror, after frantically checking every pocket, he realised that his headphones were still on his bedside table at home.

“Fucks sake,” he said.

“What the hell am I supposed to do now? I can’t listen to my Joe Rogan without headphones, it’d disturb the rest of the people here. Sometimes I wish I was less considerate,”

“This is the first time I’ve let myself down like this, I’ve never done my morning commute without headphones before. Don’t know what to expect.”

Despite his pessimism, the 28-year-old finance worker made it to work without dying of boredom.

He told The Advocate that he actually enjoyed the silence as it allowed him to have a period of deep introspection.

“I learned a lot about myself this morning, might try it again.”

Somehow Mum Knows ‘I’m Staying At Lucy’s’ Is Code For ‘I’m Getting Blackout Drunk In A Park’

TEXT:

With her best-laid plans in place, Candice Watson didn’t expect them to go awry.

Leaving her parent’s boutique bespoke Betoota Grove home on Friday afternoon, the 16-year-old said she wouldn’t be home that evening – that she’d be staying at her friend Lucy’s home in the nearby French Quarter.

They were going to have a sleepover.

However, Candice’s mother wasn’t entirely convinced. She rang Lucy’s mother to confirm.

“Lucy’s mum was just as confused as I was,” said Bernice Watson.

“But she told me that Candice was more than welcome to stay and that Lucy said they’d be going to a party. I’m not sure if I should let her now. They’re up to something and I know what it is.”

Police have been called to the Greenholm Road Reserve a number of times this year, mostly in response to minor assaults and thefts as well as under-age drinking.

Bernice was worried young Candice is planning to become one of the unsupervised youths – and her concerns were correct.

Speaking to The Advocate this morning with the permission of her parents, Candice told our reporters that her mother ultimately did find out that she and her friends had been drinking in a park over the weekend.

“Basically, Mum came down to the park and caught me writhing around in a pile of leaves completely wasted. One of the private school kids down there got scared and called their parents, who then rang the police. We all scattered when we saw the paddy wagon speeding up the bike path,”

“She was furious, she kept saying, ‘Look how drunk you are! You’re in huge trouble young lady! Where is Lucy?!’ and so on. Seriously, though. Take a chill pill, Mum,”

“Anyway, turns out Mum is smarter than she looks. She knew I was lying about having a sleepover. I shouldn’t have said we were going to go our hair and read Goosebumps. So dumb of me.”

Uni Student Officially Unique After Putting Up Poster For Ultra-Violent Tarantino Film

TEXT:

A local university student has today officially entered young adulthood as an alternative individual, after paying $50 dollars for a the poster artwork of Quentin Tarantino’s Pulp Fiction, a film that was released roughly three years before she was born.

“Yeah, it’s one of my favourite movies” says Katie Mason (19).

“That, and Donnie Darko”

Pulp Fiction is a 1994 American black comedy neo-noir crime film written and directed by Quentin Tarantino, and starring John Travolta and Uma Thurman. The film was directed in a highly stylized manner and tells a series of criminal stories from the underworld of 1990s Los Angeles. The film’s title refers to the pulp magazines and hardboiled crime novels popular during the mid-20th century. It is known for it’s graphic violence and use of the n-word.

Katie, who up until six months ago still had a One Direction poster in her bedroom, has made it clear that she’s not really into the Marvel and DC franchises that are currently taking cinemas by storm – and that she’s more into dialogue-heavy ‘films’ that are presented out of chronological order.

“Everyone is talking about Hemsworth. Give me a balding Bruce Willis covered in blood any day”

Katie is yet to illegally download the entire Kill Bill triology, but says she’s pretty much hooked on anything with Uma.

At time of press, Katie was discovering the music of Elliott Smith – a musician who she now describes as the most underrated singer-songwriter since Rodriguez.

Client Sends Urgent Last-Minute Change Through On Microsoft Word 2003

TEXT:

The hard work of redesigning a website has met another dire snag for Betoota development group, Tech Suite Ltd, who it has been reported was sent last minute changes from the client in the form of a jpg on a Microsoft Word document, readable only on the 2003 version of the word processor.

The document in question contains an augmented version of the client’s logo with a different font sitting above the previous one within an opaque text box and coloured lines that appear to be done on Paint. This image is followed by red text in all caps that reads;

“SOMETHING LIKE THIS?? CAN WE GET THIS TODAY PLAESE [sic]?”

According to designer Sara Moore (32) this is the kind of behaviour she has come to expect from her client, Miller’s Plums.

“This guy just does not get it. He wanted a scrolling bar on the side of the website that says ‘Miller’s Plums’ over and over again. Never should have leant him that Byron Sharpe book, it’s fucked with his head.”

Miller’s Plum’s brand manager James Gauci (55) is responsible for most of the last minute changes which are usually sent in the form of a title-less email and on one occasion, on a USB he sent in the mail.

“I don’t get why he’s hired us, he’s telling us exactly what to do. I just don’t think he knows how to do it himself. He uses a Dell laptop to send emails from an AOL account on Internet Explorer but he’s the one telling us how his website should look.”

For Gauci, this type of resistance is exactly the sort of thing you deal with when working with ‘creative types.’

“It’s a bit of them not understanding my needs. With respect, I think I know a bit more about selling plums than they do. I want to be the Apple of plums and they just don’t see that.”

“At the end of the day, I’m an internets [sic] user. Surely that gives me just as much right to critique to work done for me by a team of trained professionals.”

Gauci plans on addressing these points with Tech Suite Ltd, at the monthly meeting he has scheduled with them on his Leunig calendar.

Friday Office Banter Peaks As Prankster Posts Zoomed In Video Of Coworker To Instagram

TEXT:

Friday office banter reached its absolute peak today as a local office worker spent most of the day  using his phone to zoom in on unsuspecting co-workers, before uploading the videos to his personal Instagram stories.

Whether the video ends in the co-worker not even realising, or at the last second noticing what’s going on before offering an exacerbated sigh, it’s all in a day’s work for self-proclaimed Office jester, James Hillpert,

“Fridays are when I can really let my freak flag fly,” said Hillpert, “And my personal favourite is the old, secretly film a colleague going about their normal day, and slowly zooming in until they notice.”

A peak prank in all walks of life really, it’s that moment of realisation on a colleague’s face that he’s been doing it that Hillpert really craves.

“Sometimes I’ll just keep doing it over and over again until I finally get that sweet, sweet recognition that they’ve been GOT.”

Other workers in the office weren’t so jazzed on the prank, with one co-worker who wished not to be named gruffly saying, “At the end of the day it’s an invasion of privacy, and the idea that this wanker is just sitting there filming us all day is weird. Very, very weird.”

“I kinda just wish he’d get some fucking work done,” offered another.

Hillpert won’t be dissuaded, confirming he’s even been saving the videos for an end of year zoom-in-on-unsuspecting-co-workers-best-of-compilation.

“This is comedy gold, and you best believe I’ve been saving every single one of these videos for our Christmas party, along with a few other gags I’ve got up my sleeve.”

Punter Watches His Horse Run Last – But Still Scans Ticket Just To Be Sure

TEXT:

Brett Combie swears quietly to himself, turns back toward his mates and curses the donkey that just cost him another pineapple.

“The fucking thing,” he said.

“It was paying $2.10 for Christ’s sake!”

The 27-year-old pilot’s cries fell on deaf ears, as two of his mates were able to confirm that Combie hasn’t been able to back a winner all afternoon.

But he’s not ready to throw his losing ticket away just yet – not until he scans it at least.

A few short minutes and loss-covering bets later, Brett scanned his ticket.

“Yeah, turns out it actually did come last,” he said.

“Which is fucking bullshit. But yeah, the fucking steel horse that I ride, the electronic betting terminal, has bucked me off all afternoon. Pig-rooting cow it is.”

“I’m going heavy on the next one. If I lose that one, I’m cutting up a stranger if it comes in with the mob when we must Bransby tomorrow morning, because I’ll be broke!”

The Advocate is currently awaiting Combie’s last bet down at the Dolphin’s Leagues Club. He’s agreed to not box anything because he bets like a man, not a coward.

Unemployed Man Who Spends 19 Hours Per Day Online Says People Need To Wake Up

TEXT:

Not many of us can say we had it all figured out at 19. Betoota High graduate Hugh Burgess considers himself one of the select few who understands the world, an achievement made all the more incredible by the fact he did it without even leaving the house.

According to Burgess, global organisations are controlling what we see and manipulating public opinion and conversation, something he takes great pride in pointing out to his Facebook friends.

“People aren’t willing to leave their ‘safe space’ and step outside their comfort zone to face the realities of the world we live in” he published on social media from the comfort of his childhood bedroom.

While most people his age are fussing away on Tinder, frequenting a pub, working or getting a degree, Burgess states that his commitment to exposing world truths is not just his full-time occupation, but his cross to bear.

“I didn’t ask for this. Having to deal with all the Mortys and Jerrys of the world. Some of the people you meet online just have no idea and are going to have to learn the hard way.”

“They talk about violence against women but never mention violence against men or just violence in general. It’s like wake up, seriously.”

For Burgess, being an outcast is one of his occupational hazards.

“Of course out there, people judge me before they know me. But if they met me online they’d see I’ve got over 2,000 Reddit karma. I didn’t get that being a slacker, did I?”

Burgess’s mum, Hestia Burgess (54), says that while she does not understand a lot of what her son has to say, she supports him, but not unconditionally.

“He needs to stop leaving so many cups and bowls in his room. Applying for a few jobs would be good as well, that way he can pay for his own chips and energy drinks.”

For this young radical, his overactive and “highly-evolved mind” is over-qualified for the jobs available in his country town and more suited to “getting society to wake up while becoming a cryptocurrency billionaire on the side.”

“I’m not trying to change the world, just maybe trying to encourage the odd sheeple to watch Zeitgeist and maybe smoke a bong for a change. It won’t kill you. If anything it will make you better.”

Report: Better Follow Up On That Missed Call From Tunisia

TEXT:

A recent report by the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman (TIO) has found that anyone who has received a missed call from an international +216 number should call them back and see what’s going on.

The attempted communication, which could have come from any number of your friends currently travelling through the 165,000 square kilometre nation between Libya and Algeria, must have been important – judging by the two consecutive missed calls.

the Republic of Tunisia is a country in North Africa, it’s northernmost point, Cape Angela, is the northernmost point on the African continent, with the Mediterranean Sea to the north and east. Tunisia’s population was estimated to be just under 11.93 million in 2016. Tunisia’s name is derived from its capital city, Tunis, which is located on Tunisia’s northeast coast.

The scenario of a few missed calls is actually common place in Australia, and all phone users are encouraged to call back for as long as it takes to either get through to someone, or get suspicious and hang up yourself.

These calls arrive at odd times and often disconnect after one or two rings, not giving the receiver enough time to answer the call. The call appears in your phone log as a missed call and tempts you to return the call.

Experts have advised that there can’t be any risk in chucking them a call back, just for the fuck of it.

Who knows who it could be, it might be a job offer or something cool like that.

Report: Dad Is Immune To The Stench Of Dynamic Lifter

TEXT:

As a boy growing up in suburban West Betoota with a green-thumb father, Sam Hannaman could often smell his house in the springtime before he could see it.

Seizing the season each March, his old man would wait until the last hot day of the of the year, typically around April, passed before he really got to work on the family’s garden.

“Around the end of every wet season, Dad comes back from CRT with half a Hilux full of either superphosphate or Dynamic Lifter. If the wet wasn’t that bad and he really gave the garden a flogging during it, he might sprinkle a bit of urea over the top beforehand,” he said.

“But yeah, most autumns at home are punctuated with a thick layer of Dynamic Lifter and jumping Jesus does it pong,”

“Dad seems to be immune to it. He begins and ends each day in the garden. I’ve seen him eat lunch out there besides the roses where he really tips it on. Everyone else can barely stand it, Christ knows what the neighbours think.”

However, Mark Hannaman spoke candidly to The Advocate this afternoon about his love for gardening and the like, saying that this time of year is special to him as all his hard work over the wet managing soils and growing root vegetables start to come to fruition.

During the long discussion, he had with our reporters via a landline telephone, Mark explained just how much work goes into preparing a garden for the cooler months.

“A solid fertiliser regime is a basic requirement for any garden,” he said.

“As for me being immune to the stench of Dynamic Lifter? To me, it smells sweet. It smells like a set of empty yards after a long day of processing stock. Progress through hard work. That’s what it smells like to me. I enjoy the smell because I see the results it brings,”

“Gardening for me is more or less my life now. I’m a 69-year-old retired engineer. What else am I supposed to do? I’ve gardened my whole life, I’m not about to stop.”

Report: Your Third Sneeze Isn’t Getting A Third ‘Bless You’, Get Your Shit Together

TEXT:

A recent report by the Australian Medical Association has found that no one is required to give a third ‘bless you’ if they are in the presence of someone who can’t get their shit together and go outside.

“Three sneezes, particularly three really loud sneezes, is just too much pressure to put on those in your immediate presence” says Professor Elton Horan from the AMA.

“Like, get your shit together. Walk away” he says.

“People shouldn’t have to deal with more than one or two”

“Let alone be required to give you divine permission to a rip a semi-autonomous, convulsive expulsion of air from the lungs through your nose and mouth, because your sensitive little nasal mucosa got irritated by foreign particles”

Several hypotheses exist for why the custom arose of saying “bless you” or “God bless you” in the context of sneezing in the Western World.

Some say it came into use during the plague pandemics of the 14th century. Blessing the individual after showing such a symptom was thought to prevent possible impending death due to the lethal disease.

Father John Ricepell, a local religious figure says that while his God will also bless anyone after a sneeze, he says that no one else should have to.

“Like, it’s obviously fine if it’s just one, maybe two if it’s in quick succession…”

“But if you are punching out three without a hanky… You can get fucked mate”

Parents Proudly Watch Son Head Off To Drink In The Park With Mates For The First Time

TEXT:

Sporting a clinking backpack and a quiet disposition that makes eye contact all but impossible, a local 13-year-old boy has flown his Betoota Heights nest for the first time to drink in the park with his closest buddies.

Francis Dollarhyde, son of a prominent orthopaedic surgeon and a well-liked early childhood educator, asked the trolley man down in the French Quarter shopping village to buy him a six-pack of Lemon Ruskis – which he plans to bring to the public gathering.

He took special care to pack the bottle individually to minimise the clinking.

Each of them is in a gym sock and stuffed into a different part of his late-model Jansport backpack – a stroke of genius he says.

“Matt is bringing the ciggies,” he said to our reporter shortly after leaving home.

“My parents don’t smoke because of is a doctor and the other is a teacher. They’re smart enough not to smoke, but only old people die from smoking so we’re in the clear, hey?”

“Anyway, good chatting with you. I’ve gotta run. Can’t tell you were I’m going but it’s safe. See ya.”

However, unbeknownst to the popular first former, both of his parents know exactly where he’s going, what he’s doing and who he’s with.

Professor Myles Dollarhyde said he used to drink in the bushes down at the Caspian Avenue Parklands with his school chums back in the day – it was in those very bushes where met his future wife.

“There was a big hedgerow of bamboo that provided great cover from the light and police patrols,” he said.

“Aside from fighting off the occasional tramp, a group of boys could spend a whole night in that bamboo grove calling girls from the payphone next to the public toilets. Those were the days,”

“We’d get blackout drunk some nights, stumble home and think we’d gotten away with it. I’m just glad Francis hasn’t got a bottle of hard spirits with him. Don’t want him to die like a musician tonight.”

Trackside Introduce Interactive Kneecapping Feature For Virtual Harness-Racing Trainers

TEXT:

The in-pub virtual gaming providers, Trackside, have today introduced a new feature for their harness-racing product: Knee-capping the trainers and drivers of horses you had bet big money on due to insider knowledge provided by organised crime sources.

Trackside is an animated racing product that combines the excitement of thoroughbred, harness and greyhound racings, but can run all night and is not strictly considered a live-betting product by certain state laws.

Previously punters could bet on these races without having to worry about correct weight, protests or track conditions. However, now the designers are opting to provide new variables in the races – such as race fixing and violent intimidation tactics

With fixed returns available on Win, Place, Bundle Quinella, Exacta, Trifecta, First 4 and Multi, Trackside gives customers an experience that is arguably better than the real thing. Punters will now be given the option to exact revenge on a jockey that either didn’t blow a race, or didn’t win one as they were told to do by corrupt harness racing officials.

“It will provide a new level of authenticity to our virtual racing” said one designer.

“We will also be introducing virtual weights for chariots as well as virtual methamphetaimes to be parcelled up the anus of horses that are expected to win”

Stock Agent Still Not Super Keen On Girlfriend Kissing Their Dog On The Mouth

TEXT:

When Doug Campbell’s father told him about hydatid cysts as a child, he was given a memory he’s yet to forget.

From the dinner table of their South West Betoota sheep and cattle property, the now 29-year-old recalls how his father reminded them of why dogs weren’t allowed in the house.

“Dad always used to say dogs were filthy. My uncle got hydatids when I was a kid and had to have half a lung taken out. Dad said it was from a dog,” he said.

“He didn’t hate dogs or anything, he was good with his dogs. He even loved a few of them. But he said a dog’s place isn’t in the family home because they carry disease and whatnot. I always wanted a house dog but Dad said no,”

“All my friends in town had house dogs. Dad said those French Quarter yuppies didn’t know the dangers of having some flea-ridden mutt nuzzle up to you on the couch of an evening time. Those memories have really stuck with me.”

Which is why, in Douglas’ own words, he feels a little bit apprehensive about watching his girlfriend-of-four-years Rachael kiss their six-month-old Staffie on the mouth.

Speaking candidly to The Advocate about his true feelings on the matter, the mid-level stock and station agent said he’s still not 100% sold on the idea – even though he knows there’s nothing wrong with it.

“Yeah look. I got the house dog I always wanted and the girl of my dreams but to be honest, it doesn’t sit well with me. This type of mouth-to-mouth contact with a dog,” he said.

“Jessie, the dog, has had all her vaccinations and that jazz. But I’ve seen her eat her own shit, vomit it up, then eat it again. I’ve seen her lick anything, including some fresh piss off a boree tree,”

“Then later on Rach plants a kiss on the dog, then one on me and the first thing I think about is where the dog’s mouth has been. Oh well, I guess there’s more important things to worry about. I just find myself thinking about this type of nonsense between the footy and cricket seasons.”

Local Gentleman Cuts To Chase And Just Gives His Hoodie To Single Woman He Met In Nightclub

In what has been described as the most time efficient decision of the year, Betoota native Steven Laundy has passed his new hoodie he purchased online directly to his a girl he just met in a local nightclub, Kat[ie] McGuire.

“I just took the plastic off it and I saw her sitting on the couch next to the shitters all alone and I just thought, what’s the point? It’s going to end up being hers anyway. So I handed it right to her.”

The decision, while controversial, has been considered hugely successful in cutting out the time between the hoodie being owned solely by Laundy until it walks out of his life – forever.

“Plus, this way it might free up one of my old ones.”

Reports state, McGuire is overjoyed with her appointment to the new hoodie and has been spotted repeatedly wearing it on the couch and seen fiddling with the drawstrings.

“It’s really sweet of him. Normally I’d have to go home with a bloke to get one but this way I get to be the one to break it in and enjoy that new hoodie feeling. He’s a top bloke he is. We didn’t even have to exchange numbers.”

“He just sighed, took it off and threw it at me.”

Maintaining he does not regret his act of compassion, Laundy is hoping this will mean some benefits for him.

“Hopefully she remembers my number and instagram name… I really like that hoodie and would like to see her again”

“She loves the drama. She knows i had nothing to do with this but is blaming me because she’s embarrassed that her kid’s dad is a dead beat”

The term ‘putrid dog’ has for many years been considered the last term that can truly shock in townie communities, after the c-word was completely normalised on Facebook newsfeeds in 2012.

Ten’s Lawyers On Hand To Serve Jarrod With An AVO The Minute Sophie Rejects Him

The legal team at Channel Ten confirmed that they were on edge as they waited for the moment many at home knew was coming.

From the outset, everyone has been fairly aware that the Vineyard Manager from the Gippsland Region was never going to win.

However, no one on set, let alone Sophie was willing to tell Jarrod, allowing his obsession with the celebrity to grow stronger every day.

As a result an Apprehended Violence Order (AVO) was prepared by the companies legal eagles to ensure that the Grade 1 creeper and potential psychopath would be unable to stand within 10 metres of Sophie after his rejection.

“We’ve got to be prepared for these things” said a spokesperson from Channel Ten.

“We have cut a lock of Sophie’s hair and taken a pair of her pants to ensure that if something happens and a situation ensues we can negotiate with him.”

“I mean, it’s quite clear some of these blokes have been shaving the carrot to Soph since her Bardot days. There’s every chance that could get a little obsessive”

Monk spoke frankly with the Advocate today about her decision to keep him on the show.

“Holy moses hey. I should have kicked him off on the first day. But he became infatuated, and I got too scared to kick him out,” she said.

Six Months Later And They’re Both Still Talking About Cryptocurrency

TEXT:

“To understand cryptocurrency, you have to first understand what normal currencies are,” said Tom Leary to his partner-of-sixteen-years, Daphne Wallace.

“Before currencies existed, you had individuals trading and bartering their services with other individuals. Do you follow?”

Daphne wasn’t following.

They were driving to Sunday brunch at Carmichael Brock’s Betoota Grove home in their leased-but-late-model Volkswagon Golf with the airconditioning on and the windows down.

She cast her mind back to mid-July, when Tom would try to talk to her about the football and who was looking like a ‘September team’ and who wasn’t. For the 3 am alarms Tom set so he could get up early to watch the cricket abroad.

All of those seemingly vapid and self-absorbed sports-based rantings that Tom did back then – she’d die to hear them now.

Because all that Tom and his close friends are capable of talking about now are blockchains, hash rates, public/private keys and smart contracts.

“You probably wouldn’t understand, it takes a lot to get into,” said Tom despite Daphne’s job which involves auditing businesses and collecting and interpreting financial data.

“I’ll try to teach you as much as I can but you’ll have to really do some reading.”

Arriving at the brunch, Tom retrieved his stylish sun hat from the Volkswagen’s practical rear parcel shelf and placed it on his head, checking the fit in the rear vision mirror while Daphne stared blankly ahead.

Walking into the flowing six-bedder overlooking town to the west, Tom and Daphne quickly said hello to their hosts, Alex and Carmichael, before separating off to opposite sides of the room.

“Has Tom stopped talking about cryptocurrency yet?” asked Alex.

Daphne smiled and cracked her bottle of warm clean skin riesling and sat down.

“No. Not yet. Has Carmichael?” she said.

“No. Not yet.”

Struggling Creative Attempts To Pay Bill With All The Exposure He Keeps Getting Paid With

TEXT:

A marginally employed local creative has taken time out of his busy afternoon of job seeking and borrowing money from his parents to speak to The Advocate about his experience trying to pay bills with exposure – the currency he’s been repeatedly been paid in for all his creative endeavours thus far.

“It’s been hard,’ said Gaige Willmott, a recent graduate of a controversial French Quarter acting school.

“I’ve got exposure coming out my ears, I’m basically the Twiggy Forrest of exposure at this point. This wouldn’t be a problem, except nobody accepts it as a payment for a good or service,”

“You’d have a better chance finding a place that accepts Diners Club. Earlier this week, I tried to pay an outstanding phone bill with exposure and the operator just laughed and said I’d been exposing my brain to too many drugs. I don’t know what to do? Do I ask to be paid in Australian dollars next time? Do people pay creatives money in this day and age?”

At a loss as to what he should do, the 26-year-old turned to his father, Glenn, who turned a humble pool building business into a national success story.

However, Glenn said that the advice he’s got for his son will not abide well with him.

“I pretty much told him to give up on his dreams, put a fucking tie on and go out and get a job,” he said.

“Suppose a lot of this mess is my fault. I indulged him in this acting and painting bullshit for far too long. But yeah, as for concrete advice, you can’t beat that,”

“These fucking Millennials, mate. What are they waiting for? A silver hand to come down from the heavens and make their dreams come true? I begged, borrowed and stole to keep my pool building business afloat in the early days. I made it on my own,”

“What really fucks me up is that he thought getting paid in exposure actually leads somewhere. One bit of advice my old man gave me was that you shouldn’t do anything you’re good at for free. I was good at digging holes, so I charged people to dig them. Simple.”

Who Says You Can’t Have Both: Millennial Builds Windowless 1-Bedder Out Of Avo Seeds

TEXT:

Local millennial, Lyall Yachty (26) says he got sick and tired of people telling him it was his fault he wouldn’t be able to enter the property market in his home city.

Lyall says he was told time and time again that it was by his decadent decisions that he didn’t have enough money to put down a 20% deposit for a home in the city where the average house price is edging closer towards $1.5 million.

He refused to be told it was his fault.

“Jokes on them” he says.

“Don’t underestimate the entrepreneurial spirit of a generation financially locked out by the old guard”

“We’ve got to make it work our way”

After working three years flat chat in a upper-middle finance role, Lyall bought a vacant lot on the west-side of the Blue Mountains, and began building his dream.

“Those three years were tough, especially considering the housing market doubled every 12 months – but I got there…”

“I just had to make a few sacrifices. One, I only designated myself a budget of 50 dollars disposable income each week”

“$15 towards Avocadoes and 2 minute noodles, $8 towards the Netflix subscription so wasn’t tempted by my own youth into going out and to have a beer with friends…”

“…and twenty dollars towards train fares to and from from 6-person sharehouse in a poorly gentrified outer-city enclave just close enough to the CBD that I didn’t have to change trains at any point and put another half hour on my commute each way”

“I changed my phone plan as well, even though I don’t consider that a luxury associated with disposable income”

While the inclusion of the avocado may seem decadent, Lyall had a plan.

“The avocado is one of the healthiest things you can eat, as a young man like me – the seed is also one of the strongest plant-based matters on earth”

After months of weekend work, Lyall managed to build an quaint one-bedroom house out of avocado seeds, just two and a half hours west of the city in a car, and three and a half on a train.

“I’m really proud of what I’ve achieved here. It just goes to show what you can do if you live a life with absolutely zero stimulation and no budget for any form of intimacy.

“Now I can have as many beers as I want, so long as it is on happy hour and I don’t have a 6 am commute the next morning”

“Which is pretty much one night a fortnight, between 6 and 7”

Brought to you in association with Virgin Mobile: while the housing market may not be fair, with Virgin Mobile FairData, you can have your avo on toast and eat it too. It’s the only thing fair about spending the rest of your life in a windowless shack that didn’t receive a DA from the local boomer-heavy council.

I Could Never Work In An Office Says Man Who Spends Every Day In A One By One Metre Cabin

A local grazier came to a shocking realisation last night while he was enjoying a cold tin as he cooked dinner on the barbeque for his family.

Mark Collins, a prominent South Betoota grain and sheep farmer, told The Advocate this morning that he could never work in an office, ever.

“I don’t know how people do it,” said the 44-year-old – moments after wooing that last of his freshly-drenched second-cross ewes out of the race.

“Getting up each morning at 7am, only to be in work an hour later. Sitting on the bus, breathing someone else’s breath. Not for me. If I could have my time again, I wouldn’t change anything. I’d stay put right here on the rich, volcanic alluvial plains here in Betoota,”

“I could never work in an office, mate. Not now, not ever. Not even a small one in town. Crazy.”

However, The Advocate can reveal that Mr Collins has never worked in an office – a salient issue when comparing the lifestyles of big city suitcucks and people working on the land.

Speaking candidly to The Advocate about his rewarding existence going to work each day at a bespoke, artisan French Quarter law firm, 25-year-old Peter Tomlinson said he sees merit in both ways of living.

“The thought of getting smoked by some rank cleanskin mickey bull first thing on dusty Monday morning is not my definition of fun,” he said.

“Also, getting so tired and dirty. What if you want to go out after work? There’s no reception out there, either. How does he watch Ricky & Mortman after dinner? Does he watch the ABC and fall asleep after Four Corners? Sorry, but yuck,”

“He [Mr Collins] should at least try working in an office before he puts shit on it. He might like it. I’ve never worked a day on a farm and I’m not getting all preachy about how much it sucks. Each to their own I say.”

Amy Dunhill, a line producer on the show, told The Advocate that one that particular night the episode was filmed, she was forced to have some lung candy in a Sydney gutter moments after dealing with ‘Ryan’s’ reaction to getting booted off the programme by Sophie Monk.

“He was pretty bad, like he was swearing at us and shit,” said Dunhill.

“Demanding things like beer and nibbles and stuff. But, um like, you’re not on the show anymore buddy. We don’t work for you anymore. Though, seriously but, though. He wouldn’t take no for an answer,”

However, despite putting on a brave face in front of the said contestant and her superiors, Amy said she was left rattled by the experience.

So rattled, in fact, she walked across the road to a newsagency and paid almost $40 for a packet of top-shelf cigarettes.

“I just needed to feel that releasing burn again race through my lungs, like getting a Chinese burn from a boy you like in primary school,” Amy said.

5 Tips To Faking Injury In The Gym So Alphas Don’t Smirk At How Much You Are Lifting

TEXT:

Restarting a health kick can be tough, especially when you realise how serious the fitness industry has become in the five years since your last run at the gym, but don’t worry, there’s ways to earn respect even though you are starting up at an embarrassing square one.

The only thing that roid boys respect more than someone who can lift heaps, is someone that has injured themselves trying to lift heaps… And if you can’t lift heaps, then your best bet is to pretend you are part of the latter.

These five tips will help you look like you know exactly what you are doing in the gym, but are taking it easy because you are recovering from a fake injury.

Stretching is generally looked down upon by people who for lack of a personality, are solely defined by their exercise routines. UNLESS you are stretching a specific muscle for over 15 minutes before you begin working out. By an overly showy warm-up, you’ll look like you tore a muscle in an overzealous pre-Stereosonic work out three years ago. Thus earning respect.

Be careful with the fake limp, it’s the easiest play, but if you make it look like the limp has come on fairly recently, then you’ll just look like a bitch who is still hurting from your fortnightly leg-day. Make it look like you fucked your back during an over the top session on the squat rack when you were by yourself one afternoon shortly after your girlfriend left you.

Those foam tube things that people roll their buttocks onto you are usually only seen used by actual athletes or personal trainers. Not only does this make you look like you 100% know what you are doing, but have to take it easy because you went straight into a leg press without warming up around about 18 months ago when you were so jacked on pre-trainer that you couldn’t see out your left eye.

Fucking around on your phone is a great way to avoid doing much at the gym while also hogging a machine – but it also makes it look like you have strict instructions from a chiropractor or doctor. Just go on Facebook for fifteen minutes at a time, but make sure you pretend you are following a safe work out plan.

Constantly asking for help from the gym staff who you aren’t specifically paying for extra attention is a great way to look like you are especially vulnerable due to an injury forced onto your body by competitive lifting. If you keep asking for tips on certain parts of your body, it will definitely make you look like someone who was once great in the gym.

A detailed Facebook post by Lees, featuring a photo of the duo posing aggressively while showing off maximum cleavage beneath flannelette shirts, contained threats to anyone thinking of ‘messing’ with Terri would also incur an equally powerful retaliation from Bec.

Further threats included that no one should ‘mess’ with Bec after “all she’s been through” and that Lees would ‘break the face’ of anyone who would dare to ‘break her heart.’

Not all locals are taking the threat seriously. Betoota RSL bartender Merl Evers (previous boyfriend to Lees) says that for these two it’s always been an on and off relationship.

“Last week Terri told me she was gonna beat the shit out of Bec because she rooted her boyfriend or something. Bec probably did that post because she was trying to scab a ciggie off Terri. You wait, next week those two will  be back to their old shit.”

When asked to comment, Bec did not echo Evers’s sentiment.

“Yeah, nah piss off! We’re basically sisters OK? Sometimes sisters fight, big deal. Merl’s probably just pissed because I dumped him.”

“I wouldn’t listen to Merl anyway,” stated Terri. “He’s a dud root.”

Our reporters were forced to flee the scene as Bec confronted Terri about how she knew Merl was ‘a dud.’

The current situation has been downgraded but Betoota residents are advised to remain alert.

Friend You Haven’t Seen In Two Years Says It’s A Shame You Can’t Make Their Gig

TEXT:

High school friend, and constant reminder that you’re not doing to bad for yourself, Jared Grossman, is ‘devastated’ you can’t make it to his gig, despite the fact you haven’t seen him in over two years.

“No way, devoooo :(“ Jared said, when you replied to his band’s gig with ‘Not attending’ despite the fact that you don’t really know what you’ll be doing that weekend, you’re just certain you won’t be doing that.

“I’ve given everyone plenty of notice,” Jared was quoted as saying “There should be no excuses. And it’s only $15 at the door.”

‘Not attending’ responses seem to be largely driven by the fact Jared has not made an effort to see people in recent years, unless it was to attend his own gig.

“Yeah we’ve stopped adding him the group chats,” an anonymous friend of Jared stated.

“Whenever we’d suggest something for the weekend he’d say ‘I’ve got a gig, you guys should come!’ and that would kill the conversation every time.”

“I’ve liked their Facebook page and listened to them on Spotify once or twice, what the hell else does he want from me?”

For Jared, this is not something he’s taking lightly, aggressively stressing that he is ‘literally devastated.’

“It’s like living through an apocalypse. What is the world coming to when your entire Facebook friends list doesn’t want to spend $15 and a Saturday evening watching their high school friend doing a metal cover of Tom Petty?”

Local Pub Chef Surprises Everyone With A Couple Sleeve Tattoos

TEXT:

Following an extended gap year, Betoota local Ryan Rickson (27) bounced around jobs, never committing to a trade or profession for more than a year.

This period of exploration may now have met its end, as Rickson made his commitment to his chef training by purchasing two full sleeve tattoos and a gram of speed.

“This is for life now. I feel at home in the kitchen (sniffs), especially now that I look and act like the other blokes I’m working with.”

“I also like rockabilly music”

Due to his years of backpacking, Rickson admits he had an existing penchant for snortable drugs and tattoos that reflect any culture but his own.

“Cheffing made complete sense. I already cross my arms in every photo so this is just the next step.”

Expensive drugs and tattoos are not the only changes Rickson has made in order to adapt to the fast pace life of a chef.

“I’m smoking a lot now otherwise I don’t get a break. Means I can’t taste my food as well but I only really eat toast these days. Who can be fucked to cook at home?”

Although the change hasn’t been as smooth as he’d have liked, Rickson is steadfast in his commitment to cheffing. 

“ I ain’t going nowhere. (Sniffs) Plus he (sous chef) is my dealer and he hooks me up well.”

“Worst case scenario I try tattooing.”

Unsure What To Spend His Money On, Talentless Single Man Buys A Cool Drone

After a profitable quarter, sales executive Louis Roberts (34) has found himself with six weeks accrued leave and substantial savings in his account. 

Single, already owning his own flat and resigning himself to never being good at music or sport, Roberts’ took the plunge this week and purchased a drone.

“It’s mad fun, paid for itself already. All the guys at boot camp love it.”

While Robert’s circle of peers are happy he has found a quasi-legal hobby, it has not been without it’s share of rough patches.

“Yeah it was great at first.” says longtime friend Malcolm Colmes. “Except he’s never let me fly it and it’s all he fucking talks about now.”

Criticism has also come from Roberts’ family.

“He brought it to my daughters christening!” stated sister Mary Roberts. “It was an indoor event for crying out loud!”

When asked about this, Roberts didn’t seem to think it was as big a deal as his sister.

“She has her baby,” he laughs “And I have mine!”

Straight Man Finds Way To Casually Bring Up His ‘Yes’ Vote In Front Of Gay Colleague

TEXT:

With the postal survey underway, there’s no denying debate over same sex marriage has been heated. However, there have been some great examples of human compassion during this testing time. 

One such example came from 32 year old investment banker Nick Panopoulos who casually mentioned his ‘yes’ vote to a gay colleague in conversation. 

“Just kind of asked her how her weekend was,” he explained. “She asked me how mine was and I said, ‘yeah did a bit of gardening, had the misses parents round for dinner, voted yes, not much else really.’”

“It’s important to not make it a thing, but like, let her know that I support her existence outside of work”

We reached out the colleague in question, executive manager Cassie Armstrong about Nick’s comments.

“Is he that sweaty one who’s always talking about his garden? Yeah he’s alright I guess. Uses the term ‘missus’ to refer to his wife which is a bit gross.”

Blissfully unaware, Nick can’t wait to continue his support for the ‘yes’ campaign by telling as many queer people as possible about his vote. 

“Louis in sales used to be a chick so I’ll mention it to him later. Notice how I used the correct pronoun? Welcome to the right side of history fellas!”

V8 Fan Scours Bathurst Campsite For The Extra Boxes Of Tins He Buried Last Month

TEXT:

A die-hard v8 fan currently holidaying in Central-West New South Wales is carefully scouring the campsite at Mt Panorama for an extra couple boxes of tins he buried up a few weeks ago.

With a metal detector in hand, Bradley Bowler (45) says he’s gone to great lengths to get around the Bathurst 1000’s controversial ‘1 carton per person per day’ rules.

“They only check ya at the gate” he said.

“But a month back this place was a ghost town. That’s when I took the little ones up to help daddy bury a few 30-can-blocks for race week”

The Supercheap Auto Bathurst 1000 is a 1,000-kilometre (620 mi) touring car race held annually on the Mount Panorama Circuit in Bathurst, New South Wales, Australia. The event is internationally popular with Supercar enthusiasts and hosts a pilgrimage of racing fans each year who camp alongside the iconic racetrack bends.

However, since 2014, limitations have been placed on the amounts of alcohol and food permitted into the site. Campers are restricted from bringing in over 200 sausages, so as to avoid the potential on-sale of food. Daily limits of alcohol also apply and each person is permitted the following limit per day: 1 carton of full strength beer or full strength premixed drinks in cans only (24 can), or 1 carton of mid strength beer (30 cans), or 1 cask of wine, or 1 750ml bottle of spirits.

“Times are a-changing” says Brad.

” I daresay it’s half the reason FOXSPORTS started their own channel for the mob who aren’t able to brave the mountain anymore”

The race starts this weekend, and is expecting to be broadcast to audience of millions outside the Central-West.

Thousands March In Sydney Demanding That The Airport Remain Open

TEXT:

Nearly ten thousand fed up Sydneysiders have taken to the streets this afternoon to voice their displeasure at the constant closure of their airport.

The Keep Sydney Airport Open movement has seemingly sprung up over the course of the morning as Sydney Airport suffered a technical air traffic control issue today which resulted in a number of cancelled flights, delays and inconvenience.

Leading the charge is Asterix Pynchon, a marginally-employed youth person, who says he’s sick and tired of seeing his airport closed for trivial reasons like strong winds and computer bugs.

“It’s not acceptable,” said the 37-year-old salesman.

“Pilots are paid like hundreds of thousands of dollars and they’re basically just glorified bus drivers. God forbid they actually have to do something like I dunno, maybe fly the plane? Yeesh!”

“Anyway, the young people of Sydney have spoken and their voice is loud and clear! Keep Sydney Airport Open! No more closures! No more nanny state! Make houses cheaper!”

However, the chief operating officer at the Sydney Airport Corporation has been sufficiently offended by the ignorance put forward by the Keep Sydney Airport Open campaign that he feels the need to respond.

Glenn Hutchinson has been running the day-to-day operations at Kingsford-Smith for close to a decade and he told The Advocate that the decision to close the airport to arrivals and departures is not taken lightly.

“I mean, come on,” he said.

“When the weather conditions exceed the design limits of the aircraft, it’s simply unsafe. Would you rather be mildly inconvenienced or be burned alive inside an upside down Airbus?

“Personally, I find the thought of being doused in aviation fuel and set alight to be quite unpleasant. However, you do have people who think the world revolves around them.”

Cruel Irony: LJ Hooker Girl Unlikely To Ever Own A Home

TEXT:

She was the golden girl of ‘90s Australian ad breaks, the optimistic face that told budding first home buyers that they could do it. 

As times change, it becomes clear that no one can escape the crushing waves of the Australian housing crisis. None less than Jessica Clarke, famously known as the L J Hooker girl, who this week it has been revealed, is likely to never own a home.

“On my salary? Fat chance.” said the 28 year old waitress in an exclusive interview with The Betoota Advocate. “Maybe if I’d made some royalties off those ads they used of me for fucking 15 years.”

When asked about compensation, Clarke informed us she was allowed to keep the teddy bear from the now iconic TV commercial. “Yeah,” she sighed. “Thank you Mr Hooker. Not.”

A nursing student, Clarke hopes to be able to afford her own home, although she is not overly optimistic. She feels the egalitarian housing market presented in the famous family-friendly ad campaign is now about as penetrable as the audiences they were once able to reach on evening television.

“Maybe if I was paying $50K for it like those fake parents of mine did in 1996. Maybe then I could afford a house instead of a crappy terrace house I share with four strungout artist and six stray cats.”

When asked if her image spurred an increase in property purchasing, leading to the current housing crisis Clarke refused to comment.

“I can’t think about that man. I won’t be able to sleep tonight if I do.”

Man That Used To Work In Hospitality Describes Those Days As If He Were In A POW Camp

TEXT:

Dale Peckham often laughs when people say they’ve really had to work for their money.

Because only a select few have ever worked a double shift on ANZAC Day and lived to talk about it.

The 29-year-old former bartender spoke to The Advocate about his days working behind a bar and while he’ll never go back.

“It was fucked. There were literally people everywhere and they were all pissed,” he said.

“We were getting smashed like ten deep at the bar all day, it just never ended. Plus, I had to work a double that day and it was pretty much like spending 16-hours standing up making drinks,”

“I mean, that’s actually working. Fuck it was gross. I’m so glad I don’t have to do that shit anymore, that I’ve finished uni now and I’ve got a shitty job in a cubical in the bowels of some hideous mid-80s office block on the edge of town. Just how I like it.”

The weak-minded, typical Libra is now an auditor at a Betoota Ponds boutique accountancy firm, where he rarely has to do anything remotely physical or remotely taxing.

However, still to this day, he recalls those days he spent behind a bar with contempt, much the same as his paternal grandfather had contempt for the Thai-Burma railway and the Japanese men who kept him hard at work.

“I literally had no other job options,” he said.

“I had to be a bartender because that’s all I knew. It was the toughest thing I’ve ever done. I think Grandpa would be proud of me.”

“Can I Leave My Bag Behind The Bar?” Says City Worker Who Thought He Was Only Having One

“Tubby are you still living down the street? he asks one of the boys.

“Can I leave this bag at your place?”

“Mate just got ask if you can put it behind the bar. I’m sure they’ll let you. Just get it tomorrow. Come on we are going out”

Josh, who is hesitant about leaving his bag with his work laptop in the hands of a 19-year-old bartender, says he might just go home for a bit – before being told to pull his head in.

“Mate don’t be an idiot. Just ask if they can hide it down with the kegs. I used to do it for people all the time when I worked at pubs”

Josh says he’s gonna have a crack, even though he’s a bit worried about losing his passport and other important documents in the bag.

Friday Afternoon Office YouTube Session Held To Ransom By Australian Internet

TEXT:

In what started out as just one bloke showing another bloke a YouTube video spiralled into half the office crowding around one computer – each of them eagerly waiting their turn to suggest a ‘cool video’ they’d seen recently.

Productivity at Mitchell Gunn & Autofellatio, one of the French Quarter’s oldest law firms, is at an all-time low at the moment, considering it’s just after five on a Friday and the green-bottle work beers have already come out.

“Oi look up the time Tony Carrol kneed the referee in the head, that was classic,” said Peter Murchison, a junior tax lawyer who also plays mixed touch.

Remembering that it was classic, once the referee woke up and he was fine, the faceless accountant at the helm of the computer showing the videos began to type in: ‘Tony Carrol kills umpire’ – clicking on the first result.

But that’s where the afternoon took a turn.

With the crowd gathered behind that young numbers man, they all stood at the buffering video for a few seconds before those seconds turned into minutes.

“Ah try this one,” he said.

“Ben Flower knockout.”

Still, after it was typed in and the appropriate video was found. Still no video.

One by one, the office began to peel off and return to their seats. Some even decided that they’d had enough for the day.

A couple just went straight home.

Woman’s City-Bay Fun Run run cut short for 3rd straight year after “copping a massive stitch” outside her trackside house

TEXT:

A buyer’s agent living at the 4km mark of the City-Bay Fun Run presented by Westpac, in the Adelaide suburb of Keswick, entered herself in the race under the impression she was going to make it all the way to the finish line this year.

The young woman said she was both shocked and devastated to go down with a crippling injury right near her house.

“I did everything I could to get my body, you know, prepped. Sometimes it’s just not meant to be I guess… Ahhhhh well, there’s is always next year” the well-meaning Sam Greenholm told The Advocate earlier today.

However, according to those close to her, Greenholm’s training regime was far from intense or rigorous.

Colleague Ash Barton said he wasn’t so sure about claims that she pushed herself to the edge in the lead-up to the race; “Hmm look, I don’t want to sound negative or anything, but I didn’t see her take the stairs to the third floor once in the last few months.”

Never one to shy away from explosive returns to physical activity, Greenholm confirmed that she did initially sign up to a local gym, but her attendance may have petered out after a few weeks; “Yeah, I realised it was a flipping complete waste of time when I can go out and run for free. That reminds me, I have to freeze that stupid membership.”

“But I had also been walking home from work in town three days a week and fasting the odd day or two a week. “Going to the gym takes the fun out of the race for me you know, it’s the stitch that really let me down. My fitness was good. I would have got to Glenelg, 100 percent,” she said.

Miss Greenholm said she is content that she did give the race a good nudge and was better prepared than previous years.

“Just entering the race is enough for me.” she said.

Man Mercifully Falls Asleep Before Seeing Australia Lose Another Game Of Cricket Overnight

TEXT:

Overnight, a local cricket fan says he drifted off to sleep before seeing Australia capitulate late in the piece against India last night.

Thinking a good match was shaping up after the tourists managed to bowl India out for 252, Glenn Powell threw caution to the wind and said, ‘fuck it, I’ll stay up for it.’

However, things didn’t start off well for the Australia.

“Seeing Warner spoon one to a waiting fieldsman early on didn’t really surprise me,” he said.

“We’ve won many games after fucking OLED Dave threw his wicket away in the first 10 minutes. Then the new bloke, fucking what’s his name. I don’t even know who’s in the team anymore. It’s like a lunchtime game of French cricket, people coming and going,”

“But yeah, I tried to remain positive but I ended up falling asleep and waking up the missus getting out of the shower at 6:30 this morning. Oh well.”

Observing this slow-moving trainwreck was a local Sandman, who are employed by Cricket Australia to put cricket fans to sleep when the national team is getting whipped overseas.

Speaking candidly to The Advocate regarding his new role as Chief Sandman of the Diamantina, Brett Sandman said last night was quite a busy night for him and his staff.

They visited nearly a hundred homes in Betoota last night, putting people like Glenn Powell to sleep with powerful tranquilisers and sand.

“We visited Glenn last night around 2 am and chloroformed to within an inch of his life,” said Mr Sandman.

“Doubt he’d remember what happened. He was kicking and screaming. Almost bit the finger off the bloke putting him to sleep,”

“But at the end of the day, we’re here to do a job and that job is to protect the reputation of the Australian Cricket Team.”

The oddly-outgoing Cancerian admits he spent most of his time studying down at the Betoota Dolphins Leagues Club, where he’s often spotted playing on the brickie’s laptops of an evening time.

“Sometimes I win, sometimes I end up pouring my beer down the coin slot and walking out,” he said.

“One bloke even got banned a few years ago for smooshing a meat pie up the cash hole. I was there for it and it was nothing short of hilarious. But last night, last night was different,”

“I got back to back features on More Chilli, which is simply unheard of. The first one was already a big win, I just wanted to play it down to an even grand but the cunt went off again. It was my time in the sun – or the moon I should say!”

The rowdy celebrations didn’t just end in the smoking pokies, they spilled out into the bistro area where the shouts of Bacardi and his friends were heard around the building.

Doing him a huge favour, the gaming attendant insisted that winnings over $10 000 cannot be paid in cash so cut the man a cheque as he writhed around on the floor in sheer ecstasy while he spoke in tongues.

Report: 9 In 10 Encounters With Tasmania Tigers Are Filmed On A Nokia 3200

TEXT:

A joint investigation between Dubbo’s Western Plains Zoo and the CSIRO has concluded that nearly all encounters with the elusive yet extinct Tasmania Tiger are filmed on a Nokia 3200.

Many researchers at the nation’s peak scientific body had their interest in the phenomenon piqued this week as yet another video claiming to have captured the Thylacine surfaced online Tuesday.

Predictably, the video was very grainy and any discernable proof from the video is extremely dubious at best.

“That got is thinking,” said Dr Tania Frost, an assistant researcher into Tasmanian Tiger sightings at the CSIRO.

“Why are all the videos purporting to be of the Thylacine always of such poor quality?”

“We here at the CSIRO couldn’t sit on our hands any longer, we just had to find out.”

So with that explosive burst of motivation, Frost and her team set out to find out why these videos are so visually unappealing.

What Tania and her team discovered rocked her to her very core.

Just over four hours into the day-long investigation, Dr Frost had enough evidence to conclude that most of these perverts who film ‘Tasmanian Tigers’ and post the video online are capturing the moment on a Nokia 3200.

“We were all appalled,” said Frost.

“But it all makes sense. As most sane human beings can tell, these animals no longer exist on this planet – and most sane, normal people do not own Nokia 3200s anymore,”

“People who still own and use a Nokia 3200 are not sane, which is enough reason why they think their filming a fucking Tasmania Tiger.”

After a big couple of days at work, local publicist Grace Leigh was left feeling like an afternoon nap would be the best thing in the world today.

With droopy eyelids and a light head, the young woman stumbled through her bedroom door and collapsed on the bed.

Knowing full well that she often wakes from an arvo nap feeling like she drank 2 bottles of wine the night before, Leigh had convinced herself there was nothing better than a little snooze.

I’ll just set an alarm for 40 or so minutes time and then get up and make dinner she thought to herself, optimistically forgetting that she literally always hits snooze for at least an hour after the alarm goes off.

And Ms Leigh confirmed to The Advocate this evening that what she subconsciously knew would happen, happened.

“Yeah, I woke up feeling like absolute shit. I hit snooze for ages after I was supposed to get up. Then when I did get up, I was drowsy, had a dry mouth, and felt like I had been bludgeoned with a blunt object,” she said.

In terms of the making dinner promise she made to herself, Leigh said that; “That definitely didn’t happen. I ended up ordering a Pad See Ew, eating it on the couch and going back to bed pretty soon after it.”

“It’s funny because when I am so bloody tired like that I use bits and pieces of science to justify going for a sleep. You know, like if you sleep for 20-40 minutes it recharges your batteries and it’s great for you.”

Local Murri Bloke Thought “Deadliest Catch” Was A Dating Show

Having never watched the program before, Ashley Colby (28) says he was in the mood for some good old fashioned reality TV when he tuned in last night, but was shocked by what he saw.

“I saw it in the guide and thought it was gonna be like The Bachelor” he says.

“Even the opening theme song was Bon Jovi … Which obviously fits”

“…So I was shocked to learn that it’s just a show about the real life events aboard fishing vessels in the Bering Sea during the Alaskan king crab, snow crab and bairdi crab fishing seasons”

Primary Schooler Rattled To Learn The Truth About ‘Elemenopee’

TEXT:

A local grade two student has today experience one of early education system’s biggest learning curves.

After 18 months of schooling, 6-year-old Benjamin Law has always prided himself on his ability to remember and recite the alphabet with ease – however, today’s revelations that he has missed five entire letters have left him rattled.

“I never knew what elemenopee looked like” says Benjamin.

“I’m shocked. Rattled, to be honest,”

“Why didn’t anyone tell me this earlier”

Benjamin says that the phonetics of the word had initially brought about questions, but he assumed it was a special kind of ‘p’.

“I thought it was one of those weird letters with heaps of syllables like ‘double-u’ – but it turns out it actually makes up five individual and crucial characters in the English language”

“I mean I had seen ‘P’ before, I just thought that maybe there was a super kind of ‘P’ – elemeno p”

Paper Wrapping Between Kebab And Foil Expected To End Up In At Least One Mouthful

TEXT:

An inconveniently tight layer of wrapping paper underneath the foil-lined kebab bag is probably going to be taken in with a few bites, it has been confirmed.

While this specific doner kebab order isn’t actually that sauce-heavy, the veteran lamb sandwich artists at the local Betoota Corner Kebab obviously know what they are doing – and if they are going to give it two layers of wrapping, then it probably needs it.

The rise of Australian adults accidentally ingesting lightly-waxed cooking paper has risen dramatically since the first significant migration waves of Turkish people in 1967, following a bilateral agreement between the Turkish and Australian governments, made to facilitate the provision of assisted migration to Australia for Turks. The 1967 agreement coincided with increasing Turkish interest in employment opportunities outside Turkey.

Turkish migrants were the first major Muslim religious group to arrive in Australia in the years after World War II. Most Turkish migrants were not in fact Turkish-born but rather Turkish Cypriots – they were followed by both Egyptian, Lebanese and Persian in the decades that followed.

One thing that all respective waves of migration brought with them was their unique style of fast-food – as well as the universal 270 x 100 x 40mm leak-proof foil lined paper bags with effective heat retention. With the iconic reddish yellow TASTY KEBAB print on the outside, the wrapping traditionally used in serving kebabs and falafel rolls.

However, while their delicious cuisine has translated well to Australian culture, and ironically Australian drinking culture – one cultural nuance that has never been discussed is how to best navigate around the occassional underwrapping.

“Just tear like a spiral as you go down” says the matriarch of Corner Kebab’s, Wendy Guerra.

“Don’t try and eat around it, it’s too tightly wrapped, it’ll get caught in the wrap and you’ll take it in”

“This really isn’t that difficult”

James Sutherland Forced To Swear Blood Oath To Rupert Murdoch As Big Bash Moves To Foxtel

TEXT:

As per company protocol, the head of Cricket Australia has sworn a blood oath to chairman and company figurehead Rupert Murdoch this afternoon during an induction ceremony in Sydney.

James Sutherland told the media this morning that upon signing the landmark broadcast deal with the Seven Network and Foxtel, he was immediately ushered into a small room off the main meeting room at Sydney’s News Limited offices and forced into drawing blood from his hand.

“They handed me a knife and told me to drag it across my palm, which I thought was a bit full on. They didn’t even tell me if the knife was clean or not,” he said.

“When I tried to pump the brakes a bit, one of Rupert’s cronies pulled his Tarocash jacket open and showed me that he had a rather large handgun in a shoulder holster. Needless to say, I quickly cut my hand open,”

“They pulled a small black and white picture of Rupert out of an envelope and made me read out this oath while my blood trickled off my palm and down onto his face. It was pretty weird but money’s money. I’m looking forward the future.”

The Advocate reached out to Mr Murdoch and News Limited for comment but only received a signed black cheque in response.

Yuppie Couple Destroys New Restaurant’s Rating After UberEats Driver Got Lost

TEXT:

A together young couple from coveted suburb of West End spoke to The Advocate regarding a night of peril at the hands of an UberEats order gone wrong.

Sally Bond and her ‘partner in crime’ Matthew Fassbender were nursing hangovers on Sunday after a night sipping Pinot Noir whilst compassionately solving the world’s problems over a “gorgeous” charcuterie board. The couple decided to order in from the cute new local burger shop via UberEats.

“We couldn’t really venture out in the condition we were in!” Sally advised.

“We ordered two burgers, chips to share, Matty got a milkshake and I ordered a diet coke. The order was said to arrive in 40 minutes.”

“We ended up waiting an hour and a half! The burgers and chips were stone cold. It was a disgrace!” said Sally. “The milkshake was great, but not chilled enough.” Matthew added.

Not one to take this lying down, Sally called the new burger joint demanding a new round of burgers to be sent out for free. When the restaurant’s proprietor advised it wasn’t possible because the UberEats driver got loss and was 27 mins late, but was welcomed to place and pickup a new order.

Sally, a social media manager at a prominent new advertising startup, took to three forms of Social Media to review the new business’s “shocking & unprofessional service.”

Giving them no stars and making Matthew leave nearly identical reviews after her’s, they brought the new business’s promising 4 star rating down to a 2.7.

“As I said to Matty, they need to learn this is how you do business these days. If you can’t rely on a trusted service like UberEats, you shouldn’t be in the restaurant game.” said the 37-year-old.

We reached out to the restaurant owner, Jovan Wishart for a comment.

“Its really hard starting up a passion project, I saved for years to do this. Everyone expects you to be signed up to UberEats, so you do it. Then when a order shows up late they destroy your business’s reputation online.”

“The worst part is, you never get to meet your customers to try and get to really know them… you know, build that good rapport and shit?!”

The business’s rating currently is a 3.1 on average.

“Holy shit,” he said.

“Holy shit, holy shit, holy shit! It’s so fucking tender – and salty. But not too salty. There’s also a gaminess and texture that I’ve never experienced before,”

“Whale meat is delicious. Like, next level tasty. My whole life has been a lie. Years of enjoying Japanese products and commodities, but hating their whaling policy – all in tatters. I love whale meat and I hate myself for it.”

Despite his strong history and background in the local private school debating league, Lennon was lost for words.

He sat in that Osaka restaurant for an hour in sheer disbelief, staring down at the plate contemplating his life.

“Fuck it,” he said.

Local Woman Wakes Up From Cute Two-Hour Sunday Arvo Nap Feeling Like A Concussed NRL Player

After a big couple of days at work, local publicist Grace Leigh was left feeling like an afternoon nap would be the best thing in the world today.

With droopy eyelids and a light head, the young woman stumbled through her bedroom door and collapsed on the bed.

Knowing full well that she often wakes from an arvo nap feeling like she drank four bottles of wine the night before and was shoulder charged by 2004 Sonny Bill Williams, Leigh had convinced herself there was nothing better than a little snooze.

I’ll just set an alarm for 40 or so minutes time and then get up and make dinner she thought to herself, optimistically forgetting that she literally always hits snooze for at least an hour after the alarm goes off.

Ms Leigh confirmed to The Advocate this evening that what she subconsciously knew would happen, happened.

“I woke up drowsy, had a dry mouth, and felt like I had been bludgeoned with a blunt object,” she said.

In terms of the making dinner promise she made to herself, Leigh said that she ended up ordering a Pad See Ew, eating it on the couch and going back to bed pretty soon after it.

“It’s funny because when I amtired like that I use bits and pieces of science to justify going for a sleep. You know, like if you sleep for 20-40 minutes it recharges your batteries and it’s great for you.”

Science Develops Long Black Coffee That’s Immediately Drinkable

TEXT:

Australia’s peak scientific body, the CSIRO, announced this morning to the media that they’ve developed a long black coffee that’s ‘immediately consumable to the consumer.’

In what’s being heralded as the culinary breakthrough of the week, researchers have told journalists that the drink comes out of the sadistically machine hot but by the time it reaches your lips, it’s as warm as a Darwin long neck.

“No longer will the astute, milkless coffee drinker have to wait 20 minutes for it to be cool enough to drink,” said one leading researcher.

“This is a world-changing discovery. People will no longer associate the CSIRO with inventing WiFi and menthol cigarettes, they’ll be saying we came up with the instantly drinkable long black.”

The discovery comes after a decade-long quest for answers, which has come at a cost of close to $90 to the taxpayer and countless burnt tongues.

Initial research found that most freshly-brewed long blacks are ‘more than capable’ of melting steel beams according to the CSIRO.

That meant the writing was on the wall, says Linda Rouse from the organisation’s beverage department.

“The bottom line is that if you have milk with your coffee, you’re part of the reason why western society is decaying rapidly,” she said

“However, enjoying milk without the cooling milk is difficult if you’re on the go. So we put our heads together and came up with a solution for the top minds of the nation,”

“So drink on, future leaders. You can now enjoy your coffee without waiting.”

Police Say Driving While On Your Phone Is Okay As Long As You Hold It Low Enough

State police departments across Australia have today admitted that they can’t even tell when people are using mobile phones, if they hold them in their laps.

“It’s just too hard” said a spokesman for Queensland Police.

“It’s fucked. It’s so hard to tell”

“Back in the day we could always tell when people were on the phone because they had it up next to their head. Nowadays they just hit speakerphone and hold it in their laps”

Western Australia and New South Wales have also declared they will not be booking or fining anyone for playing on their phone if they can keep it out of sight, so that they can’t see it.

“Yeah, it’s a tough one, hey” said Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews.

“I guess if you make sure you keep looking up at the road it’s alright”

Since the development of handheld mobile phones, law-enforcement services have been grappling with measures to restrict their use while driving. But new research has shown that these measures are nearly entirely useless in prohibiting people from using Facebook, Instagram and Twitter on their laps.

“There’s nothing we can do, we can’t see the phone”, the NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller has stated. “It’s 20 years of research, education and public policy development down the drain.”

“Well, for starters, it’s actually ‘running amok’, and has its etymology rooted in Malayan culture”, Nick Fordham from the University of Newcastle has revealed.

“The phrase traditionally describes a frenzied (usually murderous) assault carried out by a single person on a group, typically after a period of relative calmness”.

“And secondly, at that age… Like 18, 19. You really don’t know shit”

Arlo Shaw-Mathewson’s birth privilege, he says, means that he’s never been on the losing side of politics – and that no matter who’s in The Lodge, his life will go on unaffected.

“Bill Shorten is just a trade unionist puppet and the Prime Minister would throw his dog under a light rail car before he gave up the top job. I’m in the middle,”

Sensitive Tattoo Artist Gets Stroppy About Mates Saying Tattoo ‘Gun’ Instead Of ‘Machine’

TEXT:

A local amateur tattooist has today put his mates on notice.

It’s not a gun, it’s a machine.

This comes after someone made the fatal, and arguably political incorrect gaffe during a kick on last night.

Despite not being able to tattoo people for money, and only whipping this disastrous tattoo-maker out during the early hours of the morning, Jordie says it’s quite disrespectful to call his gun a machine.

“Get it right bro” he says to his drunk as fuck mates.

A recent report by the American Medical Association states that late night afterparties should avoid being in the same vicinity as a hand-held tattoo device capable of leaving permanent marking of the skin with indelible ink.

A group of researchers randomly sampled 64 adult Australians who enjoy going on benders found the average rate of homemade tattoos is much higher for people who have a friend that bought a tattoo gun online a while back.

Lead researcher Professor Leon Tallis says that the likelihood of having a Simpsons quote, dodgy caricature or drug-related puns increase dramatically if a bloke named ‘Bev’ or ‘Rowan’ is hosting the kick-on.

“One subject had never gotten a tattoo in their life” said Tallis.

“By the end of a bender they had turned their upper thigh into a canvas. Olympic rings, a Vulcan Salute, misspelt latin quotes – it was very reminiscent of the Chopper Read-style of tattooing”

However, Jordie, says it’s just a bit of skin and everyone needs to chill out bra.

“People can do what they want with their bodies after a handful of doopers and 13 schooners” he says.

“It’s also called a tattoo machine by the way – not a gun”

The Prime Minister of Australia has said today that the nation may be bound by the ANZUS Treaty to also stare at our next solar eclipse after US President Donald Trump lead the way today in Washington.

Malcolm Turnbull told a Canberra press conference today Australia is obligated to follow the United States’ direction, which he concedes may lead him to stare directly into Australia’s next full solar eclipse in 2028.

“Now that the US President has shown us the way, we as a nation must follow under the ANZUS Treaty conventions,” said Mr Turnbull.

“In the year 2028, I will be in my fourth or fifth term as prime minister and I can only hope that I can lead every Australian in staring at the solar eclipse,”

“It will be one of the great honours of my life to do so. Thank you,” he said.

The strong words come as Turnbull has been forced to defend himself after telling Melbourne’s 3AW last week that Australia would join the US in a war with North Korea as such an event would invoke the ANZUS Treaty.

However, it seems that the terms of that treaty now extends into every facet of geopolitics.

“A wristwatch is designed to be worn around the wrist, attached by a watch strap or other type of bracelet” he says

“A pocket watch is designed for a person to carry in a pocket – neither of these things need to accompany you on a diving expedition”

Travel Agent Cuts Out Middle Man And Just Sells Bag To Couple Booking South American Holiday

TEXT:

A local travel agency has created controversy this morning after they revealed that they’ve been offering narcotics to ordinary Betootanese people looking to book a holiday to South America.

Coleman & Sons Travel, in Betoota’s French Quarter district, stands accused of dealing cocaine to prospective travellers in an effort to cut out the middle man.

The agency’s director, Brett Willis-Coleman, spoke to The Advocate regarding the scandal.

“When a young person comes into our shop front and expresses interest in booking a holiday to South America, we just cut to the chase and offer them drugs,” he admitted.

“Rather than send Aussie dollars overseas, we’re keeping the money local. There’s no point in flying halfway around the world just to enjoy cheap drugs. You can enjoy cheap drugs in Betoota,”

“The only option, historically, for cheap local drug produce was crystal methamphetamine but we’re looking to change that. You don’t have people travelling to Moscow for cheap meth, do you?”

However, local police have expressed their displease with Coleman & Sons, telling The Advocate that selling commercial quantities of cocaine to vulnerable young people is both illegal and immoral.

Detective Sergeant Rick Dalhasse from Betoota Police Police said that South America offers young people so much more than cheap narcotics.

“Patagonia especially is a beautiful place, simply breath-taking,” he said.

“My wife and I travelled through the continent this time last year and had a ball – and we didn’t even do drugs once. What this travel agency is doing is simply reprehensible and somebody should do something about it,”

“But if we close down Coleman’s, we won’t have a brick and mortar travel agency in Betoota, which is a world I don’t want to live in. It’s a Catch-22. Booking holidays online is a bridge too far for a simple desert man such as I.”

Rodger, a sales manager, has been blissfully unaware about his self-promotion over the last few weeks, much to the ire of some of his colleagues.

“Look don’t get me wrong, fantastic that he did the City2Surf, I admire him and it’s a great effort. But, far out he brings it up a lot,” laughed fellow employee, Narendra Patel.

“The hobbling around like he just rode the Tour De France is really hard to stomach. I get he’s run a Personal Best, but does he have to bring it up every time I see him?”

Patel said that Samuels doesn’t even try to subtly bring it up in conversation anymore, “He just walks up to your desk, and starts telling me something about the ‘big race’.

Samuels told The Advocate this week that he is taking it upon himself to try and inspire some of his colleagues to ‘maintain the rage’ for the next 300 plus days until the 2018 race.

“It’s not that I’m better than them or anything, I just want them all to feel great about getting active, and working towards a goal you know,” he said.

The father of two said the expensive running equipment was worth every cent.

“The Fitbit helped my training immeasurably, to be honest. It really got me over the line. But at the end of the day, it’s what’s inside that counts,” he said before unbuttoning his shirt to reveal a SKINS brand torso top.

“Really helps the recovery.”

Samuels said he headed straight to the Westpac Red Zone after the race to unwind; “Um, you betcha, I went there for a massage. After the race it’s always crucial to make sure you take the recovery phase seriously.”

“The day after the race is the first day of preparation for the next year mate. Wise words from King Lebron himself. It’s something to live by.”

Patel has confirmed that rest of the office has resigned itself to a few more mentions of the fun run in general conversation, but are hoping it eases after this week.

“Oh yeah, Monday was a punish as he hobbled all around the office, but it was bearable because it meant we were on the home stretch,” Patel said.

Local Apprentice Treated To Pixelated Porno That His Boss’s Mate Sent Him

TEXT:

Graham Scholls is a simple man.

He enjoys his dog racing, party pies for dinner and building people’s dreams with his own two hands.

But for all the joy he brings into the lives of everyday Betootanese people, the 49-year-old builder often makes his 17-year-old apprentice uncomfortable by making him critique and watch pornographic videos every now and then.

Blake Washbrook told The Advocate that while his boss is a patient teacher and a genuinely nice man, he feels it’s wildly inappropriate to stand there at smoko and watch a heavily augmented young woman receive the pipe from a blatant steroid user.

“He calls me over and says, ‘Blakey boy, get a load of this!’ and stuff,” he said.

“I have to pretend to laugh and shit, otherwise he accuses me of being a ‘soft’. I actually think this whole thing might constitute as an abuse of power, as I don’t really want to watch a pornographic casting video with my boss at 9 am,’

“But yeah, he even grunts when they get into it and tells me that, ‘he used to root like that back in the day'”

The Advocate reached out to Scholls for comment, but have yet to receive a reply.

Question Time named highest-rating television drama this week

TEXT:

For the first time in recorded history, the ABC’s Question Time has taken out the number one spot in the television drama ratings category.

The national broadcaster is reportedly ‘chuffed’ with the accolade, saying that many people have worked hard on the popular programme and that this news validates that.

“Writers, producers, directors and actors. There’s too many to name but they’ve all played a pivotal role in getting Question Time to the top spot,” said the ABC’s television director.

“Beating out a host of other quality shows like Hell’s Kitchen and Here Come The Habibs wasn’t easy but somehow we did it. We did it for the taxpayers, we love you all!”

Question Time, a show set in Canberra’s Parliament House that showcases and dramatises the inner-workings of our nations political system, was once on the chopping block.

However, this recent resurgence has saved the show.

“One of the main characters was outed as a Kiwi earlier this week, which has caused quite a stir online,” said the television director.

“Memes, social commentary, Buzzfeed finally getting one back on the bloke who loathed them the most, it’s been an internet phenomenon. Mark Vaile, who plays the character of Barnaby Joyce, is in line for the Gold Logie,”

“If he wins, we’ll finally be able to wash the comedy blood off our hands that Chris Lilley put on them.”

20-Something Announces Shock Retirement From Local Club Scene

TEXT:

After plenty of nights spent salmon-ing around in sweaty Betoota night clubs, Max Gosku has finally decided to give it away.

After spending most of the day licking his wounds, the landscaper living in the French Quarter resident confirmed that he is finished for good.

“I’m fucking done, aye. I never actually liked clubbing, and now I just hate it,” he said.

“Every once in a blue moon I’ll be off my trolley and I’ll start to forget my lack of coordination in a place selling 15 dollar drinks and blaring music I have never heard before.”

“But nah, I am hanging up the boots. It’s genuinely uncomfortable most of the time, and I just end up getting pissed to make it bearable.”

Gosku said that being in a long term relationship has had a significant impact on his desire to call it a day; “The fact that I don’t need to hook up with someone in that environment really means that I would much rather be at some pub somewhere to be honest.”

“I spent over a hundred bucks at that shithole last night. Ahhh man. And don’t get me started on entry fees to places like that,” he said.

“Yeah pay money to come into our joint where we are going to charge you like a wounded bull.”

Although he can understand that women love being able to dance and unwind with a bit of a boogie, Gosku told The Advocate that it’s just not for him, and that’s fine.

Local Life Ruined After Man Clicks ‘Hello’ Instead Of ‘Photos’ On New Coworker’s Profile

TEXT:

An Old City senior content executive has been forced to fold his Compaq laptop over his knee this morning after accidentally clicking the new ‘Hello’ tab above the ‘Photos’ button on a new colleague’s Facebook profile.

Late last night, Robbie Barn fired off a friend request to the new guy in the office, Gabriel, just to be friendly.

When it was promptly answered with a resounding yes, the 25-year-old M&C Autofellatio BBDO employee thought it was high time to do some stalking.

“I just wanted to make sure he wasn’t a poon,” said Barn.

“Before Friday, anyway. We typically go out for drinks as an office at the end of the week but it’s really more of a ‘cool guy’ thing, you know what I mean? We leave all the graphics and IT guys behind because they are lovely blokes, you just don’t want to inhale a few schoons with them,”

“But fuck my life, fuck my fucking life, I accidentally clicked that fucking ‘Hello’ tab above the photos. Now he won’t leave me alone. I get making one friend at a new job is something you should do, but why did it have to be me?”

Arriving at the Daroo Street office a few minutes after Robbie, Gabriel immediately made eye contact with his new ‘Hello’ work buddy and made a bee line for his desk.

“Hey buddy,” said Gabriel.

“What’s the dealio mister bobista?”

Robbie then smiled and said nothing and that he was busy preparing for a meeting – where in reality he was weighing up whether to walk downstairs, out the front door of the office and lie down under the approaching light rail car chugging up the street.

Local Woman’s ‘Mood’ Perfectly Captured By Lethargic Domestic Animal

TEXT:

A local woman with a bad case of the pre-Christmas exhaustion has taken to social media this afternoon to vent her current feelings on the day by taking a picture of a sleeping animal and superimposing the word ‘mood’ over it.

Vanessa Smart told The Advocate that ‘she didn’t even do anything’ over the weekend but somehow she still feels as rooted as she did on Friday afternoon.

“The picture of the cat sleeping on her back with that dog next to is an accurate representation of my current mood,” said the 25-year-old.

“So I just put the word ‘mood’ over the top of it so everyone would know how rooted I feel at the moment,”

“But yeah, glad today is over. I’m going to get in my pyjamas as soon as I get home and eat more than I probably should. Maybe I’m pregnant? God If I am, the poor kid is probably still floating around in the rosé I inhaled at Friday drinks.”

“I just need a good night sleep and some pasta.”

When asked if she ever superimposes the word ‘mood’ over anything remotely positive, Smart said no, she doesn’t.

“That’s a bit of a noodle scratcher,” she said.

“I’ll get back to you tomorrow. Text me but don’t expect a prompt reply.”

Shirt Passes Sniff Test For The Third Time

TEXT:

Meeting his mother for Sunday brunch this morning, Tom Priest knew he had to look his best.

Otherwise, his mother Bridgette would grow concerned about where his life is heading, seeing as though her 28-year-old can’t even be trusted to launder his own clothes.

However, the planets aligned for East Betootanese real estate agent.

“I mustn’t have been out drinking in this cheeky blue number,” said Tom after he gave the Tarocash shirt the full inhale.

“It barely smells at all. Provided I don’t need to hug anybody, I should be able to get away with it. That’s winter for you, I guess. As long as you’re not a pig and spill a bit of lunch on it, then you should be able to wear it for a few days.”

But Bridgette did notice that it wasn’t the first time Tom had worn that shirt this week.

Speaking to The Advocate a short time ago over a wooden Chardonnay on the rocks, the semi-retired air traffic controller said that she often notices that her son is ‘barely keeping all his ducks in the same basket’ – but ultimately chooses not to say anything.

“I drop hints like, ‘The best cologne a young man can wear is a freshly-laundered shirt and brushed teeth,” said Bridgette.

“But still, he seems to have as much pride in his appearance as Sir Les Pattinson has, God rest his soul,”

“He’s a good boy, we’ll fix the laundry issue first.”

$223m study finds Led Zeppelin’s ‘Stairway To Heaven’ was probably about drugs

TEXT:

A landmark study undertaken by Australia’s peak scientific body, Bauer Media, has concluded that Led Zeppelin’s seminal 1971 song ‘Stairway To Heaven’ was most probably about drugs.

The $223m report was commissioned in early 2006 after a number of executives at Bauer, the publisher of popular men’s interest zine Picture Mag, got into an argument over what the song actually meant.

“Some thought it was about sex,” said Dennis Hooper, from Bauer’s research department.

“That’s a pretty fair guess, but most of us agreed that it was about heroin or some other scary needle drug like that. Most Led Zeppelin songs are about sex, drugs or JRR Tolkien books,”

“Or in the case of Misty Mountain Top, all three.”

Mr Hooper then went on to justify the outrageous cost of the study, which reportedly cost close to a quarter of a billion dollars.

In addition to the cost, the 11 and half years it took to come to a conclusion also needed to be justified.

“Basically, we went to Morrocco and smoke a lot of hashish and kind of lost track of time. We also partied and drank a quite a bit. It was a very Gonzo research project,”

“Totally necessary, however.”

Man defies the odds and finishes bowl of porridge

TEXT:

You’d be forgiven for thinking local personality Larry Coleman has a lap band because each time he fixes himself a hearty bowl of porridge, he always leaves a third of it to soak in the kitchen sink afterwards.

But not today.

Today the 24-year-old leasing agent-cum-entertainer powered through a regulation size satchel of Uncle Toby’s microwave porridge and hit the china at the bottom of the bowl for the first time – defying all the odds.

However, Coleman is living to regret it.

Speaking to our reporter on the D45 bus from Betoota Ponds to the French Quarter, Larry said that he feels like he’s eaten a paddy melon whole and it’s making it quite hard to stay awake.

“Mate, I don’t feel very good,” said Larry as his eyes rolled around in his head.

“I should’ve just eaten ’till I started feeling full, but I was so close to polishing the bitch so I just went ham and finished the lot of it,”

“Why can’t you open the windows on these fucking buses anymore? I need to vomit, I just need to man.”

Colemen then proceeded to vomit three times between his knees and onto the floor of the bus.

Our reporter remarked that he must’ve been quite dehydrated as the vomit itself was ‘quite thick’ and the customary ‘sploosh’ that typically accompanies a regurgitating was replaced with a dull slap.

Larry apologised to getting some porridge on our reporters jelly bean sandals he was wearing, despite The Advocate‘s dress code policy forbidding it, before alighting from the D45 two stops early.

Bloke who walked from Sydney CBD to Bondi after a night out confident he can do the City2Surf

Dave Spalding (36) said the decision to join the City2Surf, this year just made sense.

The finance analyst, who sees himself as a bit of a local legend, registered for the big race after a light bulb moment when he was out one night.

“Mate, I realised that I’ve actually done the course more times than I can remember,” he said today whilst laughing by himself.

The casual Subbies Rugby player explained that he has trekked back home to his Bondi rental from the city on many a night out.

“Yeah one night after the lock outs started, I just got real sick of waiting for a cab so I just walked home. It’s a decent distance hey; I reckon I went down at least half a notch in the old belt buckle after those nights.”

He told The Advocate that if he can do it after a night on the town then surely, it will be a walk in the park at 9am.

Spalding confirmed that he won’t be stopping in at the kebab shop on the way when he takes part in the race: “Yeah bit of a shame, I was hoping they would open early for the occasion, but I hear they have food, massages and a live band at the end in that Westpac Red Zone, so it should be a good time.”

Asked whether he had started training for the race, he told The Advocate that all his early morning walks home would set him in good stead, “I’ve got plenty of ticker mate. Don’t you worry about that. I played 3rd XV at school, hey.”

Report finds thermonuclear war may help ease pressure on housing affordability

TEXT:

A detailed report into the relationship between all-out nuclear war and the housing affordability crisis has been published by the Office of the Treasurer this morning, which outlined that the average price of a house may decrease if war breaks out.

Scott Morrison spoke to journalists today at the Betoota Press Club where he assured the area’s young people that he’s doing everything in his power to help them into their first house.

“Nuclear war would be good for housing affordability,” said Morrison.

“Chances are if all-out war engulfs the planet, a lot of Millennials and foreign investors will die. The housing market isn’ dissimilar to any other market. It’s supply and demand,”

“When the war is over and three-quarters of Australians Millennials have either been vapourised or are slowly dying from radiation poisoning, it’ll be much easier to buy your first home.”

Mr Morrison’s sentiments were echoed by the Prime Minister, who told reporters in Canberra that should the situation between North Korea and the United States escalate to a boots-on-the-ground type scenario, Australia has a responsibility to follow the US into the conflict.

While he played down the probability of total war, Malcolm Turnbull said a contingency plan has been put in place.

“Publically-educated Millennials without tertiary qualifications or family connections will be among the first to have the opportunity to serve their country,” said Turnbull.

“That should ease some pressure on the housing market and help the upper-middle-class into home ownership. However, the likelihood of that happening is very low, so I wouldn’t fret too much,”

“But you never know.”

Woman Refers To Hubby As ‘Partner In Crime’ Despite Fact She’d Never Do Over A Servo With Him

Move over, Clyde! There’s a new bad boy in town!

Or at least, that’s what you’d think.

A local marketing and public relations account manager has taken to social media for the fourth time this quarter to declare her inextinguishable love for her ‘partner in crime.’

However, Ellie Waterford and her new hubby Matt Cartwright haven’t had so much as an unpaid parking fine between them, let alone multiple criminal convicts for serious offences.

But that doesn’t stop the globe-trotting couple from leading each other around the world by the hand, letting it be known to their hundreds of Instagram followers and Facebook friends that their most recent trip to Barcelona wouldn’t have been possible without having their favourite convicted criminal beside them.

“Wintering in Europe with my partner in crime was simply perf[ect],” said Ellie.

“What that crime is, I don’t know. Mangling local customs, staying in AirBnBs that price locals out of the housing market? But I know what is a crime, not travelling and experiencing new things,”

“And I love doing all that with Matty boy my little partner in crime.”

The Advocate‘s reporter then questioned Ellie about how far she’s willing to take this seemingly not very toxic relationship.

She has no idea what ‘doing over a servo means’ and apparently only does cocaine when someone else has paid for it.

Handsome Bloke At Wedding Hopes Photographer Catches Him Doing The Cufflink Adjust

TEXT:

A good-looking local bloke who doesn’t throw on a suit that match, has stolen the show at a wedding in South Betoota over the weekend.

Patrick (32) has long ago outgrown the backwards peace sign or the ‘shaka’ in photographs, and has since had to search for something a bit more adult to do with hands when in front of the camera.

After hours researching on Instagram, Patrick has decided on the ‘cufflink adjust’.

“I was contemplating with the tie adjust” he says

“But I’m in a dinner suit and it’s a bow tie – that would like just a bit too James Bond”

While standing at the back of the room, Patrick is hoping that a photographer catches him doing a sultry cufflink adjust while looking mysterious, but not lonely.

“If I just whip out the cufflink adjust in a photo with the boys, I’ll look like a creep”

“It’s gotta be by myself. The good thing about 2018 is that in photos with the boys we can all just hug each other”

As a single man at the wedding of his close mate Tommy, Patrick is testing the waters with several of the bridesmaids – but also being standoffish enough to make them want to know more about him.

“They are gonna be wondering who I am the next day”

“That’s when they’ll see me doing the cufflink adjust on Instagram”

Curvy bloke’s new career as a social media influencer off to a slow start

TEXT:

A local larger-than-life character has spoken of the trials and tribulations of becoming a social media influencer this afternoon over a luke-warm cup of detox tea at The Advocate’s Daroo Street offices.

Dale Germert, a former agronomist turned Instagram sensation, says making the switch from the crop fields to the crop tool hasn’t been easy – especially for a bloke of his man-sized heft.

“I thought I had what it takes,” said the 28-year-old. “It’s not like I don’t believe I have what it takes, it’s just that I thought that my success would be overnight. I mean just look at me. I’m shapely and bubbly. A lot of my flesh is exposed,”

“It’s not like I don’t believe I have what it takes, it’s just that I thought that my success would be overnight. I mean just look at me. I’m shapely and bubbly. A lot of my flesh is exposed,”

“I’m starting to think there might be a double standard when it comes to these things. I just want one creepy chick to slide into my DMs. That’s not why I’m doing it, I just want the full social media influencer experience,”

However, a number of industry insiders have blasted Germert, who openly identifies as a white male, for thinking he can just come into the chook house and start cock-a-doodle-doo-ing all over the existing social media influencer industry.

Worth close to a $1bn to the Australian economy each year, thousands of male Instagram identities have rafted together to shine a light on the gender pay gap which has long dogged the social media influencer job market.

“It’s not fair that you can have a brave young man such as Dale getting up in front of the world and shaking his amble can around for everyone to see,” said one male industry insider.

“And for him to make 18% less than a female social media influencers. It’s not fair.”

“Equal pay for equal work.”

ISIS claim responsibility for local sushi train derailment

TEXT:

Popular Middle Eastern terror organisation ISIS has taken to social media this morning to put their hand up and claim responsibility for a local derailment at a South Betoota sushi train.

The duty manager of Clancy-son Japanese Canteen and Sushi phoned police just after 10 pm last night to inform them that a tragic derailment had occurred in the restaurant and that he needed the aid of the emergency services.

Police, fire and ambulance crews were dispatched to the premises, where it was established that the sushi train had indeed jumped off its tracks.

“It was horrible,” said a local firefighter.

“There was sushi everywhere. On the tables and floor. It’s quite hard for me to describe,”

“You had to be there. There was like seven of those $5 green plates on the floor and the fancy sushi was just ruined. I vomited on myself in sheer horror.”

The scene was later contained and those injured were rushed to a nearby GP’s office for treatment.

A short time later, ISIS posted on their Facebook page that the derailment was their doing and that they’ll do it again as a long as Western militaries continue to bombard and occupy land in the Middle East.

“Fuck got you fuckheads,” wrote ISIS.

“Fucking got you good. Hope you like floor sushi you stupid Betoota fucks. Gronks,”

“Stop bombing us and we’ll stop derailing sushi trains.”

Man Breaks In Wild Clothes Horse Like That Bloke From The Snowy

Approaching the cheap K-Mart clothes horse with the patience and control of the most seasoned cowboy, Sam Madden carefully broke in the awkward homeware like it was a bullish Brumby from Australia’s high country.

The 22-year-old paralegal spoke to The Advocate a short time ago with the skin still hanging off his palms and a thick bead of sweat trickling down from his hairline.

“It’s just something that needed doing,” he said, referring to his washing.

“And when it’s raining out and you’ve got no clean clothes left to wear, you’ve got to get the clothes horse out. I’m not made of money, I live in regional Australia. The cost of energy out here is enough to take the dinner off Gina Rhinehart’s table, mate,”

“So I naturally had to break in the clothes horse, which is something I like to do every winter. It’s good for both of us, the horse and me.”

According to Madden, the cheaper a clothes horse is, the harder it is to break in.

Which is why it took him close to 7 minutes this morning to work out how it went together.

“We picked it up a few years ago at the new K-Mart in Betoota Ponds,” he said.

“If you ask me, we should’ve got a quality clothes horse from David Jones in Quilpie, but the missus didn’t want to drive half a day just to pick one up, fair enough I guess,”

Crusty Bar Of Soap Left In Motel Shower Should Be Fine To Use After A Bit Of A Rinse

TEXT:

The well-travelled bar of soap left in the shower of communal change rooms won’t kill you, if you can get it under a bit of water and give it a rinse, it has been confirmed

With another person’s body hair currently infused into the top of it, the gluey corners and almost jelly underside are enough to make one question whether they should use it for the sake of using it.

However, a new study has found that the ‘shearer’s soap’ found in communal showers get more of a work out than most people are willing to admit.

A recent report by the University of Western Queensland has found that 90% of all bars of soap left in communal showers in places like shearing quarters and 24-hour gyms are used by at least one hundred other people before it gets too gross and inevitably stomped into the drain.

Betoota local, Antonio, says the bar of soap left in the shower just needs to have its exterior film washed off, and it’ll essentially be as good as new.

“I just need to expose it to the stream of water coming from the shower head for 5-10 seconds and rub it a few times between my hands”

“It’s good to go after that”

Dan Sultan Records New Song On Looped Backing Track Of Johnathan Thurston’s Laugh

TEXT:

Ahead of his upcoming national tour in September, iconic singer-songwriter Dan Sultan has today revealed a ‘secret track’ on his new studio album, Killer.

In the field of recorded music, a hidden track is a piece of music that has been placed on a CD, audio cassette, LP record or other recorded medium in such a way as to avoid detection by the casual listener. In some cases, the piece of music may simply have been left off the track listing, while in other cases more elaborate methods are used.

Sultan has stated that after four albums focusing on his life and family in both central Australia and Melbourne’s inner suburbs – he now feels it is time to pay tribute to the part of the country where he spent his most formative teenage years. Deep North Queensland.

“From fifteen to seventeen, I spent my life in the Deep North. It’s a beautiful part of the world” he said.

“I wanted to pay tribute to the people up there by giving them something uniquely North Queensland”

The song is titled ‘bleats of the GOAT’ and features a backing track of giggles from North Queensland Cowboys captain and future rugby league immortal, Johnathan Thurston, in his first ever musical collaboration.

Sultan says he kept the song hidden on his album so as to not confuse or distress his AFL-centric following down south but is confident that true North Queenslanders will be able to find the song without any problems.

The nation’s remaining music journalists say that they haven’t ever seen a genre of music that can utilise a looped backing track of a rugby league player laughing – but many feel it could quite easily become an anthem for the tip of the Q.

“I think Dan is onto something here,” said some old guy from Rolling Stone Australia who doesn’t know how to use social media.

“I think Dairy Farmers have their new club song”

Thurston says he is honored to feature on an album with Dan Sultan and looks forward to more musical endeavors in the recording industry.

Even though he did throw his board with nonchalance back on to the footpath before going on his gnarly way, he wasn’t sure whether he could hear sniggers as he sailed down the street, or it was just that he’d he’d smoked to many cones before leaving the house.

Patron Tells Bartender How To Do Job Because He Used To Be A Bartender Once

One of those downtrodden, but ultimately self-entitled millennials working behind the bar at the Betoota Dolphins Leagues Club this afternoon is Sam Watson, a media graduate who thought his degree would get him an entry-level job straight out of university.

“I want to move to the big city and make something of myself. I want to work at The Courier-Mail but I have no experience and my parents aren’t from around here, meaning they have no connections, so I’m fucked,”

But just as he pulled back the covers, he thought to himself that he must try the tea he has now sitting atop the microwave in his kitchen – just to set a baseline by which to judge the Dilmah.

“I wondered, ‘How will I know if I like Merrill’s fancy tea if I can’t remember what this el cheapo tea I have now tasted like?’ So I moseyed on into the kitchen and made myself a cuppa,”

“But on the way back to my room, I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror and suddenly realised that I’d been talking to myself about tea for 20 minutes and made a promise to a man on a television screen,”

“Perhaps I just needed to go to sleep.”

FM Radio Stations Keep Close Eye On The Bachelor For Sexy Mid-Range Bogans That Can Talk Good

TEXT:

An undisclosed number of middle-managers and senior executives at radio giant Southern Cross Austereo [SCA] are so far suitably impressed with the potential radio talent showcased on popular reality television programme, Married! At First Sight.

Answering The Advocate’s request for comment regarding the talent hunt was one of the most androgynous, soulless sycophants that brown nose their way through the corridors of SCA on a daily basis.

His name is John.

“Yes, we’re very excited about [hastag]Bachelor2019 here at SCA,” said John.

“The talent we’re seeing is just awesome, but everyone who works here is awesome. But not everyone has an awesome existing audience that we as a commercial radio need to exploit to create awesome returns for our advertising partners!”

“No favourites yet, but it’s early days! [laughs]”

Having a specialist, tertiary education in commercial radio is becoming less and less important to radio stations around the country as the popularity of programmes such as The Bachelor continue to rise.

While the lion’s share of SCA talent has risen to the top after first storming the beaches of community radio or braved the sea of stand-up comedy, more than just a couple have climbed the long ladder to the top of the board through the vehicle of reality television.

“We pair these people from shows like MasterChef or The Bachelorette with an industry veteran so you weld the existing audiences – but it doesn’t always work,” said John.

“This a lot of girls out there named Mel and Sam who barely got their 15 minutes… But At least they built a big insta following”

Regional DJ Breaks With Tradition And Ends Night With Song Other Than ‘Khe Sahn’

TEXT:

In a shock to party goers and regulars alike, a local DJ ended the night last at the Betoota Hotel around 2am this morning with Bon Jovi’s Living on a Prayer – rather than the traditional Khe Sahn the regional has come to expect.

Conor Walter, an audio engineering student at South Betoota Polytechnical College, decided to spice things up by throwing the crowd a googly, as he described.

“I was just gauging the vibe in the room and I just thought why the hell not,” he said.

“It was a Tuesday night and there weren’t many footy boys on the dance floor, which is who I typically play Khe Sahn for so they can all obnoxiously link arms and belt it out without a thought for anybody else around them.”

However, by breaking with customs, the 23-year-old risks a hefty fine from the shire council over the alleged breach of closing time procedure.

Local bylaws dictate that Khe Sahn must be played last by every DJ in the wider Diamantina community so the average punter knows that the bar is closed and the bouncers will be emptying the venue when the last plane out of Sydney leaves the terminal, so to speak.

“We’ll pay the fine if he cops one,” said Betoota Hotel manager Jack Condon.

“It’s this type of musical courage that we try to foster here at the BH. Fuck the council.”

Palaszczuk Says Coral Bleaching Low On List Of Priorities After Rise Of Graffiti In Brisbane

TEXT:

Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has today declared the catastrophic damage being caused to the Great Barrier Reef by coal mining is nothing compared to the damage being caused to Brisbane’s trendy inner-city suburbs by street artists.

“If you think coral bleaching was bad, you need to take a look at The Valley nowadays. The inner-city street art is a complete eye sore” she said.

“It’s actually quite a problem. Our government has decided to stall all environmental funding until we can find a way to stop this rise in hideous street art”

“The reef is going to have to wait”

Queensland scientists say that two-thirds of the largest natural living organism has now been devastated by severe coral bleaching, with the most intense damage occurring further south this year – but the Premier says they are just ‘geeing it up’.

“I don’t know what these so-called scientists have against me, but they really need to stop being so anti-coal” said Palaszczuk.

“Don’t they understand that the Adani coal mine will result in maybe just under 1500 unskilled jobs as well as a few vital favours in the future”

Palaszczuk says maybe her government might be able to do something about the coral bleaching if she can get enough votes out of this coal mine to get elected again.

“Voters need to remember that I’m not on $200k a year to do nothing. I promised to provide jobs to the people of India, and that’s exactly what I’ll do”

“Maybe further down the track, we can look at it”

“…once I get enough political points out of funding a near-obsolete industry back onto its feet, maybe then we can talk about this precious coral and the precious tourism operators up north”

An aerial survey of the reef’s 2,300-kilometre length by the Australian Research Council’s Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies showed 1,500km had been bleached.

Compared to its 2016 survey, where the northern third was worst off, this year the central third — Cooktown down to Townsville — recorded the most intense bleaching.

Man Visibly Suffering From Advanced Gingivitis Says Salad Doesn’t Belong At Barbecues

TEXT:

Though Kevin Daniels is currently in his salad days, that doesn’t apply to his culinary preferences.

The husky 28-year-old landscaper is having a choice group of friends coming around to West Betoota Queenslander of Durham Avenue this Saturday and he’s asking them to bring their own beer and meat – and to leave the salad at home.

“I’ve banned salad from the house!” laughed the Cancerian powerhouse.

“Keep that shit in the garden I say. I haven’t had a salad for months, not since I went to Mum’s for Easter and she basically forced it down my gullet. But this is my house, my rules. Fuck salad, I’m not a goat.”

However, a number of Kevin’s friends wish he would eat some salad – or at least brush his teeth from time to time.

Mark Collander, who’s planning on attending the weekend cook up, said that Kevin is visibly suffering from gingivitis – an inflammation of the gums, usually caused by a bacterial infection and easily prevented by proper diet and oral hygiene.

“When you try and bring it up, he just calls you a wanker and puts a burnt sausage on your plate,” said Mark.

“Not that I really care, it’s just have not to look at. It’s gross. Salad shouldn’t be banned from barbeques, that’s just fucking dumb. Without it, there’d be no acidity to offset the fat flavours.”

Half-Hearted Pokie Player Using Bottom Of Schooner To Tap Button While Standing

A bloke who is obviously waiting for someone to meet him at the pub is half-heartedly blowing a fair bit of coin on a poker machine that he isn’t overly interested in, it has been confirmed.

While wearing relatively informal clothing, the bloke is also imitating the sounds of bombs dropping with his mouth.

“beeeeeewwww boooomm!!” he mumbles as he hits the gamble button with the bottom of his schooner after yet another 20 cent return of his $1.25 spins.

“Ahhh shit. That would have been a good one if I got another one of the puppy dogs” he says aloud.

While churning through a pineapple by blindly pressing the same button over and over, It has become quite apparent to most of the other punters in the room that he is not very across in specific cartoon frames on this particular machines.

Half-hearted stand-up pokie players have been a big issues for casinos and clubs around NSW and Victoria over the last few years, as many more untainted pub patrons begin using poker machines in the same way people used to use cigarettes to kill time.

“It’s just not very good. They take so long to get through a twenty dollar note because they gamble every single cent” says one predatory Clubs NSW gaming room guard.

“These machines could be put to good use under the finger of a true punter”

As for the half-hearted bloke currently riding 50 Lions, a text message from his mate alerts him that he doesn’t need to be playing on the machine anymore and he finishes the remaining 20 in 4 x $5 hits.

“Ahh shit” he says.

“That was at least dinner and eight schooners”

We watched George R. R. Martin’s confronting sex scene GoT cameo so you don’t have to

Viewer beware!

The rumours are true. Author of the popular book-series-come-popular-television-series George R. R. Martin confirmed today that he gets his man cans, as he calls them, out in an episode toward the end of this season.

But that’s not all, the 68-year-old also revealed juicy details of his sex scene cameo that he allegedly wrote into the book himself for the express purpose of appearing on screen in his own lewd soliloquy.

Who else in the scene remains a mystery until the episode airs later this year.

But the writer has expressed his joy in being cast by the show’s producers, telling The Advocate that he simply can’t wait for the world to ‘see him at the workbench.’

“That’s not a stunt nipple, that’s my own bit of grilled halloumi on display,” said Martin.

“The character I’m playing is a mysterious merchant who puts a spell on a sexy handmaid, one that can do all that dragon shit like the other one can,”

“I won’t tell you who it is, it’s not Taylor Swift like the papers are saying, not that I’d care! [laughs]”

The show’s producers have remained tight-lipped over the special cameos this season after the backlash against Ed Sheeran’s appearance in an episode prompted to pop star to delete his Twitter account.

Tradesman Laughed Out Of Trendy Local Cafe For Ordering An ‘Expresso’

TEXT:

A popular local builder has been mocked and humiliated by an uppity barista at a trendy cafe in Betoota’s French Quarter this afternoon for ordering an ‘expresso’.

Gregory Murchison, the self-described ‘coffeeologist’ at Le Pisse Dans Ma Poche, said he enjoys it when someone wearing hi-vis comes into his trendy French-inspired eatery and ignorantly orders something by mangling the pronunciation.

“It’s actually ‘espresso’, mate,” said Murchison to Dan Pinochet, owner-operator of Dundee Builders.

“There’s no ‘x’ in it, you big simple dope! If you’re looking for the International Roast, try going to ALDI next time. We don’t sell Betoota Bitter here or have any brickie’s laptops, either! So don’t ask!”

And with that, Pinochet shrugged and walked out of the cafe to a chorus of chortling office people.

He spoke briefly to our reporters just down the road who was locked in a heated confrontation with a parking ranger.

“Oi those blokes up the road in that Italian joint laughed at me because of how I ordered coffee,” said Dan.

“They’re such wankers but shit I’m tired. They told me to get some instant coffee, which I’d rather but I’m not about to buy a big tin of it just for one coffee,”

He turned to the parking ranger, who was writing Dan up a ticket for being in a No Stopping.

“Can’t you cut me a break?”

The ranger, having heard his story, showed some evidence that they do have souls and agreed not to give Dan a ticket.

Local Woman Tells Gay Friend He’s A Perfect Match For The Only Other Gay Guy She Knows

A Betoota woman has today realised that the only two gay men that she knows would be a great match.

Holly’s close work friend, Ben, has today been told he doesn’t need to worry at all about being single for much longer because Holly knows another gay guy who could be boyfriends with.

During an afternoon lunch, Holly was heard telling Ben how hot her childhood friend Tim is, in her eyes, and that her idea of hot is probably the same as his.

It remains unseen at this stage whether or not Ben actually will be a good match for Tim, or just a little victory for Holly’s social life.

“I’m not sure” Ben tells the Betoota Advocate.

“It sounds like she’s really into the idea of the matchmaking. Not so much the relationship that will follow”

Holly is really looking forward to introducing the pair at an exclusive event this weekend. She believes that they will “hit it off”

Betoota will stay close on upcoming updates, and how their first painstaking date will go with Holly floating around like a parole officer.

Self-Described Pool Shark Asks For The Third Time If He’s Bigs Or Smalls

TEXT:

The John Oxley Pool Hall in West Betoota attracts the brightest lights in the amateur pool circuit that’s grown slowly in the wider Diamantina community for generations.

Not many are brighter than Preston Haggard, manager of a popular one-stop music shop on Betoota’s Latin Quarter.

Yesterday evening around 8 o’clock, the 29-year-old confidently strode into the Oxley Pool Hall and begun screwing his artisan Meucci cue together before limbering up as if he was about to face the English pace attack late on day four at Trent Bridge.

Haggard revealed to The Advocate over a macchiato this morning at the Old City cafe and local institution, Le Pisse Dans Ma Poche, that he selects his victims carefully and often plays coy with them about his obvious pooling prowess – like pool sharks typically do.

“My first set last night against some out-of-towner, he didn’t even get a shot in. I broke and sunk the table off it,” he said, looking up into the sun smiling to himself.

“Easy as that. No money changed hands, though. I play for the love of the sport, not cash. The next one was a bit of a challenge, he obviously knew a thing or two about playing the game. He was cheeky, cocky, young. Just a child really. I got him in the end,”

“I always do.” he said.

However, The Advocate can reveal that reality quickly departed Haggard’s account of last night’s events around the time that second game concluded.

Myles Borryce has picked up glasses at the John Oxley for close to fifteen years now while he studies Japanese at the nearby West Betoota TAFE College and he confided in The Advocate about just how good Haggard really is at pool.

“It was one fluke after another,” said the 41-year-old.

“During his third game, he had to ask the bloke if he was bigs or smalls like three times. He’s full of shit and he always puts shit on me for still being at TAFE,”

“Japanese is hard, man. I can’t help it. But at least I don’t bring my own cue to the pub. Preston is such a gimp.”

Bloke Who Only Smokes When He Drinks Lights Up Because He’s About To Start Drinking

“I have started thinking maybe I could just take em up. Like I know they aren’t healthy and it’s not cool like it was in the eighties, but all the blokes on site get so many more breaks than me cause they smoke,” he explained.

The 26-year-old Tamworth local confirmed that his girlfriend will probably give him a bit of a spray when he gets home.

“I’ll try and pick up some chewy on the way and play off that I just smell cause of the other boys but she will know. She always knows.”

Simpson couldn’t explain to the Advocate why it is that he feels the urge to punch a durry after a couple of beers but said it just felt right.

Young Lady Singing In Car Quietly Wonders To Herself If She’s Got What It Takes

TEXT:

Author Stephen King once said that people often get into writing because they think they can write better than something they’ve seen published.

The same can be said for singing and performing according to local real estate agent, Lucy Attridge.

At just seven years old, the now 26-year-old first realised she might have a future in singing – but the weight of life and expectation quickly took hold.

“I was the first in my class to sing the right amount of ‘sha-nanas’ at the start of Spice Up Your Life by The Spice Girls,” she said,

“All the others would keep ‘shanana-ing’ when Geri Halliwell started to bust out with the opening lines. I knew I had it in me but I wasn’t sure enough to follow my dream that aggressively,”

“Oh well.”

However, earlier this afternoon the vocal Virgo paused at a South Betoota traffic light and wondered to herself if she’s got what it takes to make it in showbusiness after all.

With the myriad of talent and reality shows currently broadcast around the country, Attridge revealed to The Advocate that she’s ‘seriously considering’ signing up for one of them.

“I need a story, though,” she said.

“Mine isn’t that interesting. Loving parents, private school, comfortable money, overseas family holidays, good looks. I don’t think I’d be able to crack it going at it alone like Paul Kelly or Kasey Chambers,”

“Ha ha ha! Did I just describe Taylor Swift?”

“Maybe if one of them died or my sister hurt herself skiing Val-d’isere? That’d work. Even that Kyle Sandilands would tear up. It’s something to think about.”

Barman Eyeing Off Meat Tray In Cool Room Left Behind By Wasted Bloke Who Won It

TEXT:

A universally disliked and unscrupulous local builder won the gourmet meat tray this afternoon at the Betoota Dolphins Leagues Club, whereupon being called to collect his prize, he told the bar staff to hold onto it until he was ready to go.

However, Michael Portland left 30 minutes ago – without the meat try.

His wife rang the club and asked if he was there, to which popular bartender Max Granholm replied with a quiet but resounding, ‘Yes.’

A short time later, he was helped from the premises by two friends into his wife’s late model RAV4 waiting in the turning circle at the club’s entrance.

“Look, there’s every reason he won’t remember winning the meat tray,” said Max, standing in the cool room holding the tray in his hands.

“But some prick is bound to remind him when he comes in tomorrow. I really should take it but I’d get whipped if I got caught. Risk versus reward, aye?”

Max revealed that it wouldn’t be the first time he’s pinched a meat tray from some ‘tired old piss wreak’ that he feels doesn’t deserve to win it in the first place.

The 24-year-old defended his actions by saying that the simple act of stealing a meat tray from a hopeless drunk feeds his entire share house for days.

“We’ve still got half a bottle of gas left to burn through the FootyMaster,” he said.

“You know what? Fuck him. This meat tray is going straight in the gym bag after close.”

Dale Henry was all set to take a photo of his wife Jane alongside her new car when they were interrupted by a stressed woman who wouldn’t stop apologising.

“At first I didn’t know what was wrong with her, she was very flustered,” says Dale Henry. “She stopped walking abruptly and kept saying ‘I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean to get in your photo.

“It’s believed the 74-year-old woman’s behaviour was heavily influenced by days gone by, when cameras used rolls of film with a limited number of exposures, normally 24 or 36.

“As politely as I could, I explained to the woman that there are no limits on a number of photos taken on mobile phones,” says Henry. “If someone gets in your photo, you can always delete it and just take another one. No big deal”

Onlookers say the woman took the news quite well but remained flustered and red in the face for quite some time after the incident.

‘Make Houses Cheaper!’ Says Gen Y Who Just Bought A $1400 Hooded Jumper

A self-indulgent 28-year-old advertising account manager has lashed out at every form of government this afternoon from a South Bondi cafe, saying that they’re not doing enough to make houses affordable for people like him.

Harrison Fargo, whose parents weren’t ever handed anything and had to work for everything in their lives, made the outrageous claims after splurging on a $1400 hooded jumper from the Supreme x Louis Verton [sic] Pop-Up Shop in Sydney’s cosmopolitan South West Bondi Rocks district – something that has triggered the ire of older generations.

“Ah I don’t really care about Baby Boomers and what they had to go through,” he said.

“I think they should all die. They didn’t have Supreme back in 1950, they didn’t even have keyless entry. Property was like fifty grand back in those days, that’s like two-and-a-half trips to Europe or America,”

“So it’s not fair for them to comment on my lifestyle, so they can fuck off. This is the cost of living in Sydney.”

However, Harrison’s father Graham said that he’s embarrassed about how entitled his son feels and that he often thinks he’s failed as a parent because of how the hedonistic Sagittarius goes about living.

The semi-retired 66-year-old train conductor said that Harrison was raised to know better than this.

“Why does a young man need to spend half a month’s wage on a jumper when it is not even that cold,” he said.

“It escapes me. Back in my day, we would do this type of thing differently, we saved and we sacrificed and..”

Our reporter’s recorder then went flat but you probably know what Graham was going to say anyway.

First Home Buyer Hospitalised With Avocado Deficiency

TEXT:

After buying when the market is at its highest and the interest rates are at their lowest, a Betoota Heights man collapsed yesterday on his way to work – not because of the impending financial ruin that will befall him if interest rates go up, but because of an acute avocado deficiency.

William Cornwall, a 29-year-old working in the fast-paced financial sector, told doctors he’s been going without the popular stone fruit for years now in an effort to put together a meagre deposit for a Jones Bay Road studio apartment.

A typical serving of avocado is rich in several B vitamins and vitamin K, with good content of vitamin C, vitamin E and potassium – all key to a happy and healthy life according to doctors.

Speaking to The Advocate about the dangers of going without avocados for extended periods of time, Dr Alice Kershaw from Royal Betoota Base Hospital said that she’s been seeing more and more young people being rushed to emergency with avocado deficiencies.

“It’s a worrying trend,” she said.

“Young people need to put their health and wellbeing before investing in volatile, over-valued assets such as the Betoota property market. We used to treat people for fatigue as most first-home buyers lose sleep over impending rate rises and the value of their property decreasing,”

“A lot of young people are stretching their arse to pay off a mortgage at record low rates. Imagine what’s going to happen if they go up? In my professional medical opinion, I would put avocado consumption above trying to enter the property market.”

Gay Mate Handling Tuesday Pretty Well

A gay co-worker has alluded to having a few drinks over the weekend, but there is definitely more to the story than he is willing to give up – it has been confirmed.

After three years working in a social marketing firm, Dave Mundy (28) has so far done a good job of presenting himself as a polite, run of-the-mill, single gay man who lives a pretty normal life.

However, several of his more socially-aware workmates are onto him – and are willing to bet that his ‘Mardi Gras’ probably went until 3AM yesterday morning and most likely involved some high-quality MDMA.

“Yeah. Few drinks. Went out for dinner Friday… It was great. Not a big one, though” he says, while doing his best to hide an abnormal heart algorithim and cold sweats.

Less than 48 hours after his most recent pilgrimage to Oxford for Mardi Gras, Dave’s closer workmates are very much aware that he is still in the midst of the Gay Silly Season – which usually doesn’t wind down until after all the end of financial year celebrations.

“Where’d you end up?” asks Kev, who he shares a desk with.

“Oh just some bar slash club thing in the city?” says Dave dismissively.

Kev begins to probe.

“Was that a day club you ended up at, Dave?”

Dave realises his jig is up, with Kev anyway.

“Sshhhhh” he begins whispering.

“I haven’t slept. It’s was the biggest night I’ve had this year. We were at the White Bull until sunrise – it was so fucking loose”

“I’m gonna fuck off after lunch and get back on it if you are keen?”

Kev wastes no time in accepting Dave’s invitation but wants to know if there will be any chicks there.

The loudmouth real estate agent, who goes by the name of Jordon Kulpy (27) has had too much and is being an absolute punish.

After annoying the pensioners in the front bar, the younger girls in the dining area and the group of tradies in the in the beer garden, Jordon’s own mates are at their wit’s end as to how to deal with him.

“Pull your head in, mate” says one of the blokes in his group.

“You’ll end up winding up the wrong bloke in a second”

Jordon responds by calling his mate fat and throwing an entire bowl of mentos chews across the pokie room, before doing a brown eye through the glass door into the smoking area.

At this stage, Jordon has pissed off just about everyone in the pub, except for the tatted up AJs (military personnel) out the back in the TAB.

“I’m just waiting for him to spill a drink over that way” says one witness.

“Hopefully they give him a proper hiding”

However, Jordon is somehow managing to not attract one skerrick of attention from the army boys.

While swaying down near the greyhound screens and calling his mate Gav a fuckwit from across the room, the AJs haven’t noticed him and if they have they don’t care.

“Either he’s got a pretty reliable autopilot or he’s just very fucking lucky” said Gav.

“He doesn’t seem too concerned by this but it’s very fucking tense for the rest of us”

Neighbourhood Drug Dealer Unnecessarily Hostile Towards His Customers

Even though he is by far the most intimidating person that most of his clients come in contact with in their day-to-day lives, local drug dealer Ashley Grove is still unnecessarily putting on a show of how tough he is.

Between dealing cocaine and MDMA, the 29-year-old also listens to rather intense gangster rap music, something that also scares the white-collar men and women that are forced to sit in his car when they want to buy recreational drugs.

Local finance professional and cocaine enthusiast, Tom* (name changed) says as someone who works in sales for a living, he can’t understand why Ashley thinks it’s appropriate to try and staunch someone that is handing you $300.

“All he had to do was turn up. There was no sales pitch, nothing. I call him. He turns up. I hand him money and he hands me a gram of rack”

“He’s got the easiest job in the world. What’s the point in calling me a fuckhead?”

Ashley says it’s all a part of the sales script.

“I’ve gotta play hardball so they know they can’t fuck me”

However, those that feature on Ashley’s dorky client list insist they aren’t at all interested in ‘fucking him’.

“Why the hell would I try and rip off a drug dealer?” says local Personal Trainer, Stacey* (name changed).

“The only reason I have anything to do with him is because I need someone that I can purchase drugs off – there’s not much else to it”

Man Who Haggles Down 3am Handjobs In Bali Slums Disgusted He Might’ve Eaten Dog

TEXT:

A man who has essentially been living like an animal for the last fortnight can’t believe the desitute street vendors in Bali might have been misleading him into eating dog meat.

Jayseighn, a recently-divorced FIFO worker says he’s been coming to Bali for ages now, and can’t believe the news he heard this morning from his mates back on the Goldie.

ABC’s 7.30 program has this week uncovered the brutal dog meat trade in the popular holiday destination, visited by more than 1 million Australians every year. The undercover investigation found that dogs are brutally caught, captured and then butchered before being sold to unwitting tourists on the street or in restaurants.

“That’s fucking gross” says Jayseighn, who often has unprotected intercourse with sex workers in the Balinese red light district while blind drunk.

“It’s fucked”

“I didn’t come to this 3rd-world country to do gross shit like that”

With a sick feeling now developing in his stomach, Jayseighn says it could be the beer – but it’s most probably that delicious satay ‘pork’ meal he had last night – which he now knows is probably dog.

“My dick is stinging too. That dog meat is making me all kinds of crook”

“So, so loose. But yeah, things took a bit of a turn when the sun started to come up. It totally ruined the vibe because like you realise that you’ve basically jet-lagged yourself by staying up all night drinking. Yeah, but nah, it was good.”

Much to Gunk surprise, some pals have agreed to come around this afternoon to help with the cleanup.

They too have revealed to The Advocate that everything was going great last night until the sun came up.

“That usually when people start peeling off for bed,” said friend Fred Collins, 54.

“When the dealers stop answering their phones and the conversations get deeper and more and more scat with each passing minute. That and the sun coming up. It’s a recipe for disaster.”

Mr Gunk said he plans to spend the first part of his afternoon sitting in the shower on a plastic chair throwing up his partially digested brunch.

Gunk et al. were part of a wider study into the kick-on culture sweeping the district, which has found that close to 90% of all parties and late-night boozers are ruined by the sun coming up.

Details of the report are set to be released next week.

Rugby Fans Sitting In General Admission Very Careful To Not Get RMs Dirty

TEXT:

Several rugby fans that were forced to sit in the Remienko Memorial Stadium’s General Admission area, after missing out on corporate tickets with their dads, have been spotted standing on their plastic seating to avoid getting chewing gum or discarded on hot chips on their boots.

Local Rugby die-hard Bryce Anderson-Botha says it’s not every day you get the chance to see the Southwest Queensland Gidgees versing a team they could 100% beat on paper, playing football just down the road.

“I nearly didn’t come when I heard there was only general admission tickets left… ”

“But it’s cold enough to wear a scarf and people don’t usually know where you’ve been sitting when you hit the pubs in the French Quarter afterwards”

“I had to just bit the bullet and sit down there with the boys. It was like being trackside at Bathurst 1000. I was standing on the seat most of the time”

The team captain Stevie Stevens has conceded he overestimated the Gidgees desire to win in their upset loss to the Ilfracombe Tricolours.

The Gidgees’ 24-19 defeat in at ‘home’ in Betoota’s leafy Eastern Suburbs has only left fans more concerned about the future of rugby union in Betoota, and coach Michael Trollipole is forecasting personnel changes to fix everything once and for all.

The loss will see the Gidgees drop from third on the Country Queensland rankings to possibly sixth, while the Tricolours are set to climb to fourth.

Strawberry Blonde Tired Of Being Lumped In With The Filthy Rangas

TEXT:

After being teased relentlessly all through primary school about his ‘auburn’ hair, a local strawberry blonde has lashed out of those in the community who lump people like him in with redheads.

Nathan Nalbandian, 28, spoke to The Advocate this afternoon about the issues he’s had over his life being a young, arguably handsome, successful strawberry blonde and how being called a ‘ranga’ has held him back.

“I mean, what more do we have to do? We were born this way. We can’t change who we are. I’m not a fucking rednut. I don’t have red hair and if you can’t wrap your head around it then fuck you,”

“My hair is strawberry blonde. Not red, not ginger, I’m not a fucking flamer. For fuck’s sake, though. I hate filthy rednuts. Unlike them, I can actually tan. I’m not one of them so stop calling me one.”

The irate ginger then got up and stormed out of the interview room here at The Advocate’s Daroo Street offices and took off down the road huffing and puffing.

A follow-up interview was planned at a cafe in Betoota’s Latin Quarter, but Mr Nalbandian failed to show.

Passive Aggressive Note On Office Fridge May As Well Have Just Named The Bloke

TEXT:

A seemingly-lighthearted but oddly specific note left on the office fridge is pretty much only directed at one employee, it has been confirmed.

While it was apparently placed on the door as a ‘simple reminder of etiquette for everyone’ – it also seems to delve a little bit into the home life one specific individual.

Judging by the mentioned of ‘how things work at home’ and referring to the entire office with a singular word like ‘mate’ – the entire office has come to the conclusion that the note was solely directed at Jason from accounts, who still lives with his mum.

“The crumbled tasty cheese that he’d tried to grate with a blunt knife sat their for days” said Sarah from the front desk.

“You’d think his mum would go the whole way and give him some grated cheese for the spag bol she made him”

Jason, however, is basking in his own ignorant bliss. The unhygienic 29-year-old is completely unaware that the note was mostly written about him.

“I tend to agree with whoever wrote that” he says.

“The place can look like a pigsty somethimes”

Quality Of Italian Restaurant Measured By Amount Of Comic Sans In Menu

TEXT:

A popular Italian diner in East Betoota has defended their use of the controversial Comic Sans font in their menus today after a number of customers made negative comments about it online.

The Mangiare La Figa Ristorante on Brunswick Street has served the wider Betoota region for close to 50 years and enjoys a solid reputation for quality homestyle Italian cooking for a reasonable, family friendly price.

However, many online reviewers have remarked that the menus have a lot left to be desired.

Ellias Knipkin, a local graphic designer, took to Zomato to express his disdain for the ugly typeface and layout of their menus.

“You can’t have a $60 bottle of wine on a Comic Sans menu,” he wrote.

“The other stuff I’m fine with. The $12 parmigiana with a side of spaghetti bolognese for an extra dollar? Yeah, that belongs on a Comic Sans menu. But the other stuff? I mean, I love this place but they need to fix their menu up pronto.”

However, Mangiare La Figa‘s owner Cenzo DiCampo said he has no intention of changing the menu at all – including the Comic Sans – and that anyone who knows anything about Italian food should know that the basic font is a sure sign of high quality nonna-standard Italian film.

The 66-year-old explained to The Advocate that his margins are already razor thin and any unnecessary expense such as redesigning the menus when they’re ‘perfectly readable’ is bad for business.

“What’s that matter with the menus?” he asked, throwing his hands out in front of him palms up.

“You can’t read them? No? Of course, you can! Can you read? Yes? The wine comes from all over the world. I buy for $50 and the customer buy for $60? Shoot me. Getting it out to the middle of the desert is expensive!”

“Yeesh. Let me focus on the food”

Locals Get Postcode Tattoos As Permanent Reminder Of How Boring Their Beachside Community Is

A bunch of blokes from a low-key, retirement town, are desperately trying to emulate the surf-gang culture made popular by the 2007 Australian documentary Bra Boys: Blood is Thicker than Water.

Despite the fact that none of them are very good surfers, brawlers or community figures – the Mac Boys are under the impression that nearby towns are aware of who they are.

Similar to the Gold Coast’s Palm Beach ‘Palmy Army’ or the Northern Sydney ‘Avcats’ from Avalon Beach, the Mac Boys claim to be ‘very tribal and protective’ of the 550 metres between their north and South headlands.

“Locals only” yells one of the fellas, Glenn, who is often confused for his younger brother who is school captain of the nearby high school.

“Stand your ground”

With most of the girls in the town now at university in the city and the entire gang being given deadlines to find jobs or move out of home, the 20-somethings are very aware of how tough life can be in seasonal surf village.

“We never had nothing” says Jai, who works for his dad at the cafe adjoining the surf club.

Local Pub Burns Down Despite Not Being Heritage-Listed And Still Making Heaps Of Money

TEXT:

Firefighters have been left reeling today after a pub that was doing pretty well in terms of money, burnt to the ground overnight, in what emergency crews describe as a ‘one-percenter’.

Regulars of the Lying Swagman Hotel in Betoota Heights say they can’t understand why the pub, which had pretty sizeable weekly takings from bar, kitchen and pokies, could have been burnt down like this.

“It was a great pub. People actually went there” said Glenn, who lives down the street.

“There is literally no reason why you would want to burn this pub down”

Emergency respondents who arrived at the scene at midnight say that this almost never happens.

“This almost never happens,” said one SES respondent.

“This might actually be an accident. Pubs burn down every day in Australia but very, very few of them aren’t intentionally lit”

The act of burning down a pub is believed to be the safest bet, when dealing with slowing business, as is lying about how much the pub made before it burnt down when talking to insurance companies. This traditional Australian business practice is more commonly known as the ‘Irish Stocktake’

Local Man Rejects Toxic Stereotypes By Cracking Open A Warm One With Female Friends

Local bloke, Andy Madden, has shocked everyone today by cracking open a room-temperature bottle of red wine and sharing it with some platonic female acquaintances.

“Who’s ready for some pinoooooot?” he asks in a friendly, relatable tone that could easily make him look a bit gay, even though he isn’t.

“Me!” says his female friends in unison, in an equally jovial manner because they feel empowered by having a male friend who doesn’t subscribe to the toxic and often exclusive stereotypes of Australian masculinity.

While Andy admits to being partial to the concept of cracking only cold ones with only the boys, he says it’s also quite liberating to do the same with female friends.

“You just learn so much stuff. As a single bloke, I really benefit from these kinds of friendships”

“sometimes I do it with a mixed group of male and female friends too”

After several bottles of red wine and a great catch-up, Andy says his goodbyes and tells the girls to have fun on the rest of their night out together.

Drunk Men At Back Of The Restaurant Must Be On Some Good Coin Judging By The Crownies

TEXT:

FLASHBACK: September 10, 2001

Six business partners have clinked their crownies together in celebration of their recent numbers.

The pre-internet surf wear magnates have surprised even themselves with how popular a brand name piece of headwear without a top on it would be.

After a day of playing golf in the outer suburbs of the Gold Coast, the all-male group of businessmen have made their way to a prominent surf-n-turf restaurant on Cavill Avenue to toast their recent numbers, which because it’s the nineties, are based solely around how many people physically walk into their stores.

A sports visor — also called a sun visor or visor cap — is a type of crownless hat consisting simply of a brim with a strap encircling the head. The top of the head is not covered and the visor protects only the face, including eyes, nose, and cheeks, from the sun – the visor was at it’s peak in the late 90s.

Australian surf brands like Billabong and SMP (sex, money, power) changed the visor from something old people wear at golf tournaments, to something that radical teenagers with frosted tips wear while doing kickflips at a council skatepark.

By the name the marketing was complete, they were flying off the shelves from suburban surf shops like the ones that these men have franchised.

“We did it boys” yells one of the businessman.

“Lobsters and jet skis from now on!”

Another red-nosed thirty-something shouts in agreeance.

“HEAR HEAR!”

“Retail is the business to be in. Forget this internet stuff!”

While things do look on the up and up now, as of 5 June 2013, the company will be yet to finalise a takeover deal with either of the two American private equity suitors; all six men will be divorced by the turn of the millennium and online shopping will dominate the market they found success with.

Half-Pissed Bloke At Pub Withdraws $300 For Some Cheap Headphones

A boozy Adelaide man has made the executive decision to withdraw $300 from a nearby ATM, just in case he and the boys decide they want to order a few cheap headphones later.

As the afternoon drinks look like they are about to become a lot bigger than initially thought, he makes the executive decision to ensure that he has the cash on him when the topic of buying a few cheap headphones arises.

“Is this bloke selling them for $300?” he asks his mate who has the dodgier connections.

“Yeah $300. Not bad stuff” says his mate.

“Great sound. Real pure”

The rise of young corporates sniffing fat lines of Central American headphones in the bathrooms of Australian pubs has increased in recent months – in a similar vein to the early 2000s trend of burning and inhaling boogie board bags.

“Anyone feels like some tomato tins as well?” asks another bloke.

Report: 95% Of All Boomerang Videos Involve Pouting Women Raising Glasses

A recent report by Instagram has found the 95% of all looped videos created by their splinter-app, Boomerang, are actually just of young women drinking wine or cocktails.

The study, which was created to better identify behaviour patterns, has found in almost all cases the 5 second loop shows a half-hearted ‘cheers’ between the girls.

The findings also show that of the 95% – at least half show all women pouting.

Instagram researcher Matt Muckerberg says that it isn’t of any surprise that there is always one girl that looks way better than the others do.

“It’s the girl who uploads it that looks the best. It usually takes a couple goes… At least until she is happy”

“Unfortunately we don’t have immediate access to the videos that get deleted – because there would be quite a few”

“If there is only two people in the video, then they both look hot, but I would love to see the amount of trial and error that goes into it”

“I Know You Saw My Text Like 33 Minutes Ago But It’s Not Like It’s A Big Deal Or Anything”

A local woman is very well aware that she isn’t number one priority, after closely monitoring her phone activity since she first saw the ‘read’ icon on her phone text messenger app, close to 33 minutes ago.

What’s worse is that she saw the three dots pop up a couple times as well.

“It’s like, I know you saw it” she says, with a disarming tone.

“And it’s not a big deal”

Men and woman around the country have long been victims of the ‘read’ or ‘seen’ icons in text messenger services, with many claiming that they heard you could turn it off – but they don’t know how.

Not only have both blossoming and steady relationships been affected by the smartphone feature that lets you know when someone is ignoring you – but friendships as well – as pressing matters like ‘what are you wearing tonight’ or ‘when do I pick you up’ are often left to sit.

After initially appearing like she was avoiding confrontation in the early stages of a crush that has been showing signs of turning into something semi-official, she couldn’t help but continue with the topic.

Mothers Day Crisis: Why do you show up to every family event hungover?

Kelly Copeland says she can’t help being the life of the party, it’s a rare honour that she takes very seriously.

However, each of her Sunday starts the same way, whether it be a special day like today or just another morning brushing the sambuca off her back molars.

“I don’t know why she rouses on me so much,” said the 24-year-old junior lawyer.

“I worked hard at school, university and life. She doesn’t have a monopoly on my morals. Christ if she knew half the things I got up to last night, she wouldn’t be able to even look at me. I’m sorry I’m hungover, Mom [sic] but at least him here.”

Report: Pushing Drunk Mate Into Somebody’s Nice Hedge Is Hilarious

TEXT:

A recent report by the CSIRO has found that the height of one-off, situational drunken comedy comes from shoulder charging a friend into a manicured bush.

Lead researcher, Professor Paul Vautin says anyone who has witnessed this happen would agree that it is a serious pissa.

“Of the 1800 subjects we interviewed and monitored, we have found that 97% of young Australian men and women can recall laughing their ring off after seeing a friend recklessly bumped into garden outside an RSL or local tavern”

“The female respondents pointed out that seeing two skinny legs with high heels pointing upwards is even fucking funnier”

While the perfectly trimmed gardens outside RSLs and Leagues Clubs have been identified as the ideal form of shrubbery for this sort of horseplay, the study has also found that racecourses and house parties are also prime opportunities for shoving a mate into plant life, and hoping they don’t get fucked up by the pointy branches within.

“The cut off age for this behaviour is usually mid-forties” said the researcher.

“When you get to about 46, that’s when people stop laughing at you falling over… for fear of a broken rib or something that nature”

“However, it is completely okay to push people of that age into pools or open water. Providing their phone isn’t in their pocket”

Sydney Stockbroker Relieved That #BanTheBag Petition Isn’t What He Thought It Was

Double Bay-based Stockbroker Joseph Gilling is very glad that his initial interpretation of the #BanTheBag petition wasn’t correct.

The 32-year-old Martin Place cowboy has since called off his local drug dealer, who was due to drop close to a kilogram of pure Sydney-recut cocaine, in a mad dash to stock up on his favourite recreational drug before it got ‘banned’ for good.

“[laughter] Man… Don’t I look like an idiot” he said.

“Here I was thinking that I wouldn’t be able to numb my face three times a week”

“Turns out this petition is about stopping pollution or some shit”

Last week, Channel 10 presenter, Waleed Aly challenged three Australian premiers to step up and ban a product millions of Australians use everyday day: the plastic bag.

During his “Something We Should Talk About” editorial on Wednesday night’s edition of The Project, Aly took aim at Australia’s astronomical use of plastic bags and called on the premiers of New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia to “ban the bag” in an online petition.

Joseph says he thought there was something a bit off about the numbers.

“That Waleed bloke said Australians use between four and six billion bags annually… More than 10 million plastic bags, every day”

“I mean, I know we go pretty hard, but that’s a fair bit of fucking rack”

Joseph says it’s even more embarrassing that he had completely forgotten his weekly habit of 10 or so ‘Bondi bags’ was actually illegal.

“[laughter] you completely forget these things”

“I was wondering how that would be able to ban it, then I realised they already had”

He also offered governments advice on how to cut down on the use of plastic grocery bags.

“Just make it so anyone who wants to get their hands on some has to spent 20 minutes sitting in an idling WRX with $300 cash clenched in their fist”

“It hasn’t stopped me, but it definitely makes you think”

Darker Afternoons Good Enough Reason To Justify Not Going To The Gym

The fact that it’s already dark at knock-off is a perfectly good excuse to not exercise on this Monday afternoon, it has been confirmed.

With a winter chill in the air, and a gloomy stillness usually associated with warm soup and TV-series-bingeing, the nation is currently tossing up whether they avoid going to the gym this afternoon and get home to a doonah.

Other options include, going on a cute dinner date with an attractive person you met over the weekend, or going to the pub to convince yourself that you can spend more time in the pub because you went immediately after work.

While skipping exercise on a Monday is not an uncommon occurrence, it is very rare that getting home to snuggle up on the couch makes for a decent enough excuse.

Australian workers have been advised to avoid jumping the gun and eating dinner too early, as a 6:30pm meal usually results in a late night dessert or bag of chips.

While originally thought to have its root in the Germanic phrase, ‘Can you just pay for my airfares, dad?’, researchers from the CSIRO have concluded that to wanderlust is to laden one’s self in debt in order to travel.

“Come on. That’s gotta be done by now” says one salivating idiot.

However, as is usually the case. There is one bloke, maybe two, who claim to have cooked up a few spit roasts before.

They think that while it might look like it’s done, it’s actually quite deceving.

The barbeque, which has been organised by the female social circle that these blokes mutually share through their girlfriend and wives, has an open ended timeline. This makes it all the more difficult for the introverted male guests who were just hoping to get a feed and bail with their missus.

With no real list of proceedings for the afternoon, the blokes are now circling like vultures until one of the alpha’s gives them permission to rip in.

“You can cut a bit of the snout off if you want to give it a try” one of the spit roast veterans disgustingly suggests.

“Nah. Don’t want to spoil it” says one of the more eager blokes.

With sunset looking like it could easily be arriving before the food, the blokes are now transfixed on the rotating steel and red meat.

Despite the fact that the office kitchen is completely kitted out with glassware, water dispensers, and coffee cups – the bloke whose name might be Jake (or Jason?) doesn’t seem to think there is any better way to hydrate himself than by glugging water through a cylindrical half litre plastic container with a 5 inch hole in the top.

Coworkers allege that his only other stand out personality trait is being overly keen to put his name down for office fun runs and touch footy sides.

“Look, the kid was always a bit funny” said Karl.

“We’d seen his room with all the gadgets and whatnot, but we never bloody heard a thing. it was all a creepy to be honest”

“Yeah turns out a decent song is pretty important in the whole music thing” said Cooper “I mean I had the rest. I did a few audio production courses, I’d collected heaps of good gear, programs, plug-ins and that. Hopefully I can sell most of it off”.

Cooper is looking forward to the next chapter of his life, which includes moving out of his parent’s place and finding a new way of making good on his promise to buy them a mansion.

Pub Patron Given Unnecessary Amount Of Shit For Having Coaster Stuck To His Schooner

TEXT:

Patrons at Betoota’s Lord Kidman Hotel stood in awe this afternoon as a local concreter, Rick (29), obliviously drank from a schooner glass with the coaster stuck to the bottom.

Rick, who was initially acting a bit shy in the spotlight, said he has no idea how it happened.

“Some of the punters were kind of into it… But some where giving me shit” he said.

“It’s actually happened before. So random”

While enjoying a few early arvo knocks off, Rick said he wasn’t even looking when his ice cold glass of Betoota Bitter brought the coaster up to his face for his third sip of the round.

“The moment I heard Ted ripping into me about my magnetic schooner I just pissed myself”

Witnesses say there was no sign of adhesive chemicals used

However, ABC presenter/adventurer/advertising guru Todd Sampson says that while the image of a coaster attached to a schooner is a fucking pisser, he is yet to find someone who can offer a brief explanation of why it happens.

“Listen, mate” he says, in his weird Australerican accent.

“No one knows how this happens. It doesn’t anywhere else in the world. It is a purely Australian phenomenon”

“Science is certainly my way of understanding the world and its complexities and intricacies,” Sampson told the Betoota Advocate.

“I am an incredible science enthusiast, and I encourage my kids to be science enthusiasts, and they both are. It’s not necessarily everyone’s way of understanding the world, but I believe in it so much I’m willing to put myself on the line for it.”

“But this coaster thing has got me fucked”

Facebook Feels Man Should Be Notified Of Former Classmate’s Birthday

TEXT:

Lewis Pynchon took the time this morning to thank Facebook for letting him know that it’s Stan McCarthy’s birthday today – a bloke he hasn’t seen or heard of since he completed a COM305 group project with hin June 2009.

“While I appreciate the sentiment, I’m going to have to pass on passing on my birthday wishes to Stan this time around,” said the 28-year-old.

“No hard feelings, I just don’t think it’d be appropriate. I wish him every success in life, I just don’t think it’s right to let him know that.”

However, the East Betootanese part-time-stay-at-home-son revealed that it’s not the first time the American social media giant has reminded him of something socially inappropriate.

Just last week, Lewis was asked by Facebook if he’d like to see the live stream a former high school classmate had just begun broadcasting.

With his interest piqued, Pynchon clicked on the notification and was treated to Gilbert Sullivan ranting about the government while he punctuated each point to the forward-facing camera with a thrust of a Bowie knife in his other hand.

“Looks like Sully’s finally lost his mind! [laughs] You know, sometimes Facebook comes through with some gold.”

Confidently Pouring Beer On Hot Plate Showcases Man’s Barbeque Skills

TEXT:

A local alpha male who has taken on the duty of cooking all of the meat at a barbecue in the park, has nonchalantly poured beer on the hot plate several times now, as though it’s some sort of traditionally family recipe.

Friends say that there was absolutely no questions asked when local outdoor furniture retailer, Shaun (28) took hold of the tongs and began fiddling with the tap on the gas cylinder.

“He didn’t even bring the barbecue” said Katie, the birthday girl and a close friend of Shaun’s girlfriend.

“Dave bought the barbecue… and I bought the meat”

“Mind you, Shaun did bring a heap of beer. Most of which I believe is currently sizzling alongside the sausages”

When questioned by Katie’s 18-year-old cousin, Mitch, as to why he kept casually pouring beer on the barbecue, Shaun pretended it wasn’t a big deal.

“Oh that. That just helps you clean the pan a bit”

“But yeah it doesn’t hurt to pour it on the snags either”

“Mate, I’m gonna go get a couple beers. You want to take over for a bit?”

With Mitchell now manning the hot plate, with a beer in hand, it appears the crown of masculinity has been passed down to a new alpha, to share the secret of pouring beer on the barbecue in front of his own friends.

Motorist Relishes In Opportunity To Blow Horn At Other Motorists Who Mildly Inconvenience Him

TEXT:

As Theo Delonghi pulled up to the intersection of Boyd and Longhurst in Betoota’s Old City district, he noticed that he was about to get the green light to proceed across the intersection.

However, some inconsiderate colostomy-bag-of-a-human-being, by his own description, had queued across said intersection – which caused mild inconvenience to the supplement store owner.

So as the light turned green, the 27-year-old sounded the horn of his late model automatic four-cylinder Ford Mustang as he rounded the arsehole who blocked his path.

“I could feel the pleasure way down in my balls. A heavy, powerful tingle. Right on the gooch,” said Delonghi, as his eyes rolled back in his head in ecstasy recalling the moment.

“I know that beeping the loser in his Toyota LoserCruiser queued over the intersection wouldn’t help the situation in the slightest, I never pass up an opportunity to sound my horn at lesser motorists,”

“They say the meek will inherit the Earth, but the alphas rule the roads.”

According to local business owners and residents who live around the notorious intersection, it’s not uncommon for people to queue across it – and Theo isn’t the first person to take pleasure in needlessly honking someone who makes that mistake.

One resident has taken it upon himself to leave a box of river rocks beside his fourth-story window overlooking the intersection. Not so he can stone the clumsy motorist causing the inconvenience, but to cast rocks at those who create noise pollution.

“I got one bloke the other day,” said the resident, who asked to remain anonymous.

“He was driving an older model Volkswagen Golf convertible, the ones with the canvas roof. Anyway, he was honking away at some poor fucking truck driver who got caught out. Yeah, big deal mate, just drive around him and be on your way. But no, he just stood on the horn and pissed everyone off,”

“So I went to the window and threw a stone down at his car. Thing is but, it went straight through the canvas and clocked him right on top of his head. It turned him off like I hold the power button down on a frozen laptop. He careened across the intersection, seizing behind the wheel, then crashed into the cafe, crushing a parking ranger in the process. Win-win I say.”

Local Weapon Desperately Tries To Keep Silly Season Alive With Fourth Message To Group Chat Suggesting Friday Beers

TEXT:

Coming to the end of a relatively short week, with his boss away on business and only one meeting to attend, a South Betoota project manager has desperately tried to keep the silly season alive this afternoon by hitting up every group chat he’s in – trying to lock in a few after work.

Campbell Lieberman has had two false starts this week.

One on Tuesday when he had six schooners with a client and spent half the night writhing around in bed unable to fall asleep.

Then again yesterday, when despite getting four under his belt, he wasn’t able to complete the descend into a drunken stupor he’s grown to love.

“So annoying,” said the 25-year-old.

“All week I’ve just been tonguing for cold tins with the boys. Not just a couple, I’m talking about crushing ten at the Lord Betoota Hotel, then asking for a show of hands for who’ll be wanting a few bottles of nosé for later, we get a carton or three from the bottle-o on the way back to Slinko’s place and we will kick on and get very weird,”

“Is that so much to ask?”

So far, the desperate cry for help has received a few hot leads, as well as a few cold ones.

Afternoon Storm Somehow Good Enough Reason To Have A Few

The fact that it is about to rain quite heavily is a good enough reason to go to the pub, it has been confirmed.

Local man, Rowan Dixon (27) should probably be getting home and making sure all of his windows are closed, but has somehow convinced himself that this is a good time to have a beer.

“It’s going to piss down in a second,” he said.

“Yeah. I better stay inside. I might just head to the pub until it all clears up a bit”

With his mates all convincing themselves the same thing and arriving at the same venue, it seems that water falling from the sky is as good as any excuse to put their adult lives on hold and order a few jugs.

“I just looked it up on BOM,” says close mate, Graham via text.

“It’s gonna be a big one, aye. How are you getting home? I might just have a few at the Royal until it clears up”

“It’s probably not a good time to be on the roads. Or at least walking home”

CSIRO Finds Global Warming Failing To Remove Ice From Regional Australia

TEXT:

Australia’s peak scientific body has concluded this morning, after a decade-long study, that the rising global temperatures are having no effect on the amount of ice found in regional Australia.

As first thought, the CSIRO predicted that as global warming and climate change wreak havoc on the nation’s ecosystem and agriculture sectors, the amount of ice found in regional areas would begin to decrease.

“It makes for alarming reading,” said lead researcher Glenn Brooker.

“As the average temperature steadily rises, the amount of ice continues to rise. It sounds scientifically impossible, but I can assure you, there’s more ice in regional centres now than there was 50 years ago,”

“At this rate, there will be more ice than forest fires in regional Australia by 2020.”

The whole of regional Victoria,  four-time winner of the coveted Forgotten By Canberra Award from National Geographic Traveller magazine, is expected to be completely ‘frozen over’ by ice within a decade – something that scientists are struggling to find solutions for.

One method the CSIRO has devised for de-icing places such as regional Victoria is to create projects that spur on climate change – such as mining and energy production.

“Perhaps if we can get jobs and polluting industries out into these areas hardest hit by the ice,” said Brooker. “Then perhaps we’ll start to see the ice begin to melt.”

“Either that or just let the region freeze over and start again somewhere else.”

Passengers can choose between low quality airline content or movies that were advertised a lot but critically panned – with the option wide open to begin watching a new TV show, that you’ve never heard of but has apparently been around for a while, from the fifth season.

Local passenger, Sarah (33), says she’d never heard of Brooklyn 99 with Andy Sandberg – until today.

“I just thought, hey why not start a new TV show from episode 55”

“it’s not what you usually do, but I just figured if this is the only option available then it must be the best”

“Anyway it turns out you need miss out on some crucial character developments, but I laughed at the slapstick stuff.”

Weird Fast Food Franchise Only Exists In Domestic Airports

Although the coffee/smoothie/sandwich bar has similar branding to Gloria Jeans and Boost Juice, it’s overpriced products are quite shit, and they seem to make a motza as the only option in a place that people sometimes hang around for hours at a time.

Local businessman, Ryan Sbar, says he travels a lot for work and is often forced to eat in these weird as hell ‘restaurants’ that act like they are age-old hospitality institutions.

“They use all these big words like ‘espresso’ and ‘single origin’ but no one seems to order anything other than cappuccinos and toasted sandwiches” he says.

The Private School Gap-Year Pastoral Company Welcomes New Jackaroos

TEXT:

After acquiring Mount Munrow Station from the E.H. Pearson Cattle Company late last year, The Private School Gap-Year Pastoral Company is welcoming their inaugural crop of first-year jackaroos to town later this week to a considerable amount of local fanfare.

Mount Munrow manager Phil Taranaway told The Advocate this morning that he’s excited to see the amount of ‘go’ these spoonfed-dough-bangers have in them.

“Yeah but nah, mate. Hopefully, these smooth-handed-necktie-wearing boys and girls have a bit of fire in them, because Christ knows they’ll bloody well need it,” he said.

“We’ve got 24 decks of unprocessed weaners coming down from the Gulf next week and that’s just the start of it. None of the ponies have been ridden for three months so they’ll be fresh as buggery. That and most of the fences are rooted from that last bit we had over Christmas,”

“There’s too much on for me to have a team of useless soon-to-be tertiary-educated ringers, you know what I mean? I need a couple old hands on deck.”

Filling the headstockman’s boots this season at Mount Munrow is local cowboy Ellis Cornwell, who revealed to The Advocate that he’s been told he needs to ‘mellow out a bit’ when he starts working with these fresh rich kids from the soft country down south.

Known for taking to lazy ringers with a jigger and blowing up at every cunt but himself when the camp blows a mob of lively 4-year-old Brahman steers on a heavy trot, the 24-year-old former first-year privately-educated cowboy said he’s taking a different approach this year.

“Yeah look,” he said. “I can’t go around yelling and screaming at cunts who don’t know what they’re doing this time around. I’ve gotta be more of a teacher Phil said.”

“So anyway, looking forward to the opportunity. Hopefully, I’ll get them up to being halfway useful by the end of the year, then they’ll fuck off to university and we’ll have the same problem next year.”

Recently-Single Local Girl Comes Steaming Back Into Newsfeed With Her Jacked Personal Trainer

TEXT:

After only six weeks back in the game, a local ex-girlfriend has recently bombarded social media with photographic evidence of her new active lifestyle – in a trendy new gym, in a trendy new suburb.

The 28-year-old by the name of Jenna was recently broken up with, by her commitment-phobe boyfriend, James, who after 18 months, still hadn’t given her any form clarity about where their relationship was heading.

After posting several photos that show her getting close with a seriously rigged personal trainer in front of her new F45 gym – it is quite clear to everyone in her social media circle, that Jenna is back.

Jenna says the supposedly platonic relationship with her womanising PT has helped gain the confidence needed to start shagging around again.

“Trent’s a really nice guy. I wouldn’t want a romantic relationship with him… But it probably could be a nice jump start”

“I think it’s just enough to stoke a few old fires on social media. Now they know Jenna is back” she says while breathing onto the lenses of her new Bailey Nelsons, before taking a sip of a new style of coffee that she has only just heard about.

Local man, Charlie Boylan, says he was kind of keen to hear that Jenna was single again, and these photos have just confirmed that it might be time to try it on.

“She’s a sort, mate” he says while swiping through the inundation of photos on her recently recharged Instagram.

“That ex-boyfriend of hers was a grub. I’m glad she’s done with him. I’m fucking into it”

Jenna’s ex-boyfriend was approached for comment but he was too busy unsuccessfully trying to root all the girls he thought he could have rooted when he was with Jenna.

Armidale Declares Betoota Bitter Best Thing To Happen To Their Town Since Dean Widders

TEXT:

The mayor of Armidale in in New South Wales’ north-west has today declared that Betoota Bitter is the best thing to happen to their town since Dean Widders.

Speaking to Channel 7 out front of the New England town’s McDonalds this morning, Councillor Herman Beyersdorf said that having Betoota Bitter on tap at the White Bull Hotel tonight made him proud to be an Armidilian.

“It is an absolute honour to have this here beverage available in our humble town” he said in his strong Hungarian accent.

“Not since the great Dean Widders was scouted playing for the Greens did our town ever reach such heights”

Dean Richard Widders (born 25 October 1979) is a former professional rugby league player – (2000-2001 Sydney Rooster, 2002-2006 Parramatta Eels, 2007-2008 South Sydney Rabbitohs) – who is commonly referred to as the greatest sporting product to ever come out of the celtic belt.

Nicknamed ‘The Pride Of Armidale’ it is believed that when visiting his hometown, Widders is never required to buy himself a beer.

“I just wish Dean was here to celebrate with us” said the mayor.

“I would buy him a Betoota Bitter myself”

Deputy Prime Minister and former resident of Armidale, Barnaby Joyce has said he can’t wait to pull back in to the city of cathedrals to ‘tie one on with the Albies boys at the White Bull’.

“It’s just great that we can get an honest beer out here. It’s made by bushies, for bushies”

“And it doesn’t make you feel like fighting, which is a good thing, I ‘spose”

Dean Widders was also approached for comment.

“I just think it’s great that this town has something to take pride in again”

“I mean, I wasn’t a world beater, but I was certainly the best thing to come out of there”

“I’m making the trip up tonight to get a lick at the White Bull”

Bloke in motorsport team shirt asked if he’s lost after walking into art gallery

TEXT:

After getting another rinsing from his wife about wasting money, a local coal seam gas worker walked into a North Betoota art gallery looking to invest his earning more wisely.

However, the owner-operator of the Gumnut Cafe & Gallery on MacGuiver St thought Michael Craig was lost. Not because he lost the ability to breathe through his nose after a childhood accident with a microwave oven. Not because he ordered a double shot tall mocha with four marshmallows before walking into the gallery.

He was asked if he was lost because he was wearing a motorsport team shirt – the antithesis of an art lover.

“Yeah, look. My wife [Julie] said if I bought another set of battery-powered power tools or a jet ski, she’d march me down to the doctors and get my man beads disconnected – a ‘vesecymony’ [sic] or whatever it’s called.”

“Anyway, this fucken dork came up to me and asked if I was lost. You should’ve seen the prick, dressed like an engineer when they come out to make sure us dumb fucks aren’t looking for gas down the wrong hole or something. Timbs, chinos, some checkered shirt and a pair of Bailey Nelsons on top of his head. So of course I gave him a piece of my mind.”

The 34-year-old then launched into a tirade, explaining to the art gallery employee that he was here to invest ‘cold hard cash’ in one of these ‘wok-eyed’ paintings and that if he wasn’t going to help him, he’d go to the next gallery on Macadamia Raod.

After some discussion, Craig bought 17 artworks for a total of $3500.

Feeling chuffed with his investment, he stopped by the Betoota Hotel for a quick afternoon pot. A short time later, a scud blew over a rain all over the art still sitting in the back of his Hilux.

Mate Brings His Coworker To Pub And Fucks Up The Jugs-To-Boy Ratio

TEXT:

After twisting their arms, Glenn Kruger finally got the boys to change the post-work drinking venue to the newly opened Le Coq Et La Bouche Cafe – a local French-inspired beer cafe.

Occupying the former Cattleman’s Hotel site on the corner of Cordillo Rd and Marlboro Street in Betoota’s Old City district, the trendy new Francophile watering hole is the place to be seen around town.

“That should’ve been the first warning,” said Glenn’s mate Mike, who agreed to meet up for a few quite jugs with the fellas after work.

“It’s a real cunt of a joint. They don’t have any real beer on tap, just those reach-around-hot-breath-on-the-back-of-your-neck pale ales that you’d find in Elton John’s bar fridge. All I wanted to do was to head down to the local and enjoy a cold schoon of Betoota Bitter and be home for tea,” said Mike.

“And they fucking sting you for it, too. I only agreed to go because it’s been ages since I’ve seen the boys.”

Switching venues from the Betoota Hotel, home of the famous $1 hot gold tin special, was also a red flag for Sam Reynolds – the last of the trio to accept the venue change. He too had similar motivations to Mike.

“Yeah, look. I went to that French place with the missus the other day and rest assured, my suspicions were correct. This waiter rolled his eyes when I asked for an English menu. Cunt, we’re in Betoota, not Bordeaux. He’s lucky he’s still got the use of his legs after that. Anyway, it’s just a few beers after work, what could go wrong?”

Something did go horribly wrong.

Glenn brought a mate from work, who many around Betoota’s construction management community refer to as a ‘megapoon’ or an ‘outright colostomy bag of a human being’.

“He fucked up the jug-to-boy ratio. There’s three schooners in a fucking jug, not four. Cunt, I was lost for words. I can’t even remember what his fucking name was, but he drank dark beer and wouldn’t go near the Tiger jugs we were hoeing through,” said Mike.

“Fucks sake. So a shout went from a $12 Tiger jug to that and a fucking $8 schooner of some shirt-lifting cappuccino porter or something to that effect. Fucking day ruined cunt.”

Dinner Ruined After Lunchtime Party Pie Burns Living Shit Out Of Mouth

An ordinary day on the tools has turned sour for one West Betootanese carpenter after an innocent lunchtime party pie left him with first-degree burns to the roof of his mouth.

Hired to construct a cubby house for a local banker’s child, local chippy Henry Washbrook and his two offsiders had lunch prepared by the banker’s wife – which included some party pies, which are considered a local delicacy.

10AM Schooner Of Heavy Went Down Surprisingly Well

TEXT:

Today is a special day in the Australian calendar where the nation pauses to reflect and pay their own tribute to those who’ve served us all across the armed services.

ANZAC Day is also a day celebrated in the most Australian way – a day started with a cool refreshing schooner of heavy beer at 10 o’clock in the morning.

It went down so well, 29-year-old James Ropedale is currently on his third – and considering that none of the boys have any little ones to get home to, maybe even a fourth could be a goer.

“It’s been a particularly easy decision to make” says James.

“I’m walking distance from home and the missus has got yoga or some shit until late – I’m making an executive decision”

With the golden rays of afternoon sun seeping through the glass frontage near the TVs, and now glistening off the Betoota Bitter tap in the front bar, James says his sting is starting to turn into a buzz.

“It’d have to be a pretty bloody important phone call to drag me out of this place right now,”  he says, notably more chirpy than he was a couple hours ago during a phone call with his partner.

“Pour me another,” he cheekishly barks to the lippy 18-year-old bloke behind the bar.

“Are you boys alright for anothery?” he says at his mates.

They all reply with firm yeses. One punter, close mate Brett, even says ‘when in Rome, dear boy,’.

“Give us a couple jugs then young fella,” he spits back at the barman.

Overcome with euphoria of drinking cold beer on a lovely, kind of warm but kind of humid, afternoon, James asks if the kitchen is open tonight.

“Who knows,” he says to the boys.

“Might give it a bit of a nudge tonight. I haven’t done a good mid-week sesh since last year.”

Apple Asks Customers To Avoid Discussing The Outside World With Genius Bar Staff

TEXT:

A recent report from the Australian Consumer Advocacy Group, CHOICE, has found that the average Apple genius bar employee is unable to hold a conversation that covers more than 2-3 non-Apple related discussion points.

CHOICE spokesman, Professor Elle Hardie says that anything beyond ‘how ya going?’ is almost too much for most ‘geniuses’ and that anything related to current events, or even the weather outside of the Westfield shopping centre they are based in, could result in uncomfortable social gaffes.

“What we have found is that if any customers make any form of human connection with these people, they begin to twitch. It is best to keep focused on the issues at hand”

“It can make an already very stressful trip to the Apple store that much more painful”

This cultural deficit made headlines in December last year when an Apple Genius Bar employee fainted after being asked his weekend plans by an attractive female customer.

Two weeks ago a Genius Bar employee in the South Betoota Apple Store failed in his attempts to hide a very obvious erection, after brushing hands with a 50-year-old divorcee who was visiting about a scratch iPad camera.

This lack of social skills within the ‘cult of genius’ has been addressed in recent months, with Apple officially asking all customers to avoid mentioning the outside world when interacting with their support staff.

“Please do not encourage these people. They are not fit for the wild just yet”

Uber passenger, Mark Madden has just jumped straight into the same fucking conversation he’s had twice a week for the last three years, today.

The hospitality worker from Betoota’s Old Quarter found himself at a loss for conversation with an extremely chirpy Uber driver.

Mark starts with the usual shit.

“How long you been driving for” – Only to learn that this is one of those ‘after-work’ type drivers, who are only doing it for a bit of extra cash.

This leads Mark on the exact same fucking path he ends up going down most times he uses the ride-sharing app.

Speaking to the Betoota Advocate shortly after his $15 fare to his girlfriends house, Mark says he knew exactly what the driver was going to say.

“I know for a fact that they usually can pull around 150 in a good arvo. That’s assuming he works until around 9ish”

“It might have decreased a little with the saturation of drivers in this particular market, but it’d only be a ten, twenty dollar variation. At the most”

“I just wish one of these blokes could give me something a bit more interesting to talk about on these trips”

“But I spose with the stringent criteria they have to meet, I’m not exactly going to be dealing with park cricketers”

“I know I’ve told about a hundred of these pricks that they are onto something and I might start driving myself, but the truth is I have way too many red flags next to my name when it comes to a police clearance”

Toasted Sandwich Filling ‘Can Melt Steel’ According To Government Study

TEXT:

A week-long study into toasted sandwich filling conducted by Australia’s peak scientific body has concluded that the molten food stuff is ‘more than able’ to melt steel beams.

Earlier today, the CSIRO released a statement to the media outlining the findings – which failed to surprise any red-blooded Australian raised on the popular dish.

The type of steel beams popular in the construction industry have a melting point of approximately 1500 degrees celsius, whereas scientists discovered recently that some toasted sandwich fillings can reach temperatures of 5600 degrees, hotter than the surface of the sun.

“It’s really quite exciting,” said lead researcher Jack Waters.

“I’m sure many people will tell you that they’re not surprised by learning this, as nearly all facial burns suffered in this country are caused by toasted sandwiches. They’re not dangerous to consume but are often consumed too quickly after cooking. This is a significant discovery none the less.”

However, the study’s findings have come too late for one South Betoota disability pensioner, who lost his both his cheeks in a toasted sandwich-related incident.

In 2011, Shenal Hatton bit into a leftover taco mince and cheddar toasted sandwich just seconds after retrieving it from the press. What happened next rocked our small town to its very core.

“I basically lost my cheeks,” he said, after some struggle.

The sound of Hatton makes when he speaks is similar to the noise heard when emptying a hot water bottle in the morning once it’s gone cold.

“I remember biting down into it and feeling the stuffing burn through my cheeks and slopping down onto the table. I watched it burn through my plate and onto the floor. That’s my dream; that’s my nightmare. Burning, sizzling, through my cheeks… and I’m surviving.”

Bloke Who Went Fishing For First Time Last Week Says His New Nano PX 762 Is Best Rod Out

TEXT:

A bloke who went fishing last weekend, for the first time since his childhood, is now really a fishing guy, it has been confirmed.

While even claiming to have a few ‘secret spots’ – East Betoota man Ed Davison (27) is today flaunting his new Shimano Tcurve Nano PX 762 & Rarenium CI4+ 1000FB 1-3kg Spin Combo fishing rod to his mates in both a group chat and in wider social media.

Only seven days after he caught his first fish in his life, and had to throw it back in because it was undersize.

Local mate, Brett, is a bit sceptical.

“Mate he wouldn’t have known the difference between a lure a propeller last week. He literally hadn’t been on a boat for ten years”

“He’s just had a bit of fun and realised that people listen to him when he talks about fishing. So he’s going all out”

All out is correct, with Ed even buying himself some special ‘fishing clothes’ – including long sleeved lycra skins and amphibious reef shoes.

“There’s too much drag on the other stuff. I used to wear just footy shorts but it’s not ideal for the long days out on the boat”

Local Woman Still Not That Interesting Even After Getting A Wrist Tattoo

TEXT:

A local woman finds that people still deem her uninteresting despite having just gotten a wrist tattoo.

Evelyn Mitchells, 24, currently working as a “retail specialist” at Zara, opted to stencil her wrist with a psychedelic butterfly design while on a recent trip to Bali.

“I know it looks like something you see on the front of a packet of incense in Byron,” says Mitchells. 

“But it really reflects my inner connection with the universe. I expected more of a reaction than when I got my braces off, you know?”

The reception from her social circles was lukewarm at best.

“She’s the type of girl who mistakes an accent for a personality,” says one close friend. “That’s why we stopped staying at hostels abroad, and that’s why she pulled this little stunt.”

“This impulse could have easily been exercised in henna,” comments her mother. “I just wish she’d realize we love her either way.”

“Yeah, it’s doing nothing for me,” says a colleague. “I mean, it’s something to look at, I guess. That being said, still would.” 

Mitchell’s remains confounded on the subject of why people still do not find her a fascinating character. Reports suggests she is considering a Roman numeral tattoo on the back of her neck next, perhaps even a bird of some kind on her ankle. Developments to come.

Despite Swimming In Credit Card Debt, Local Student Casually Starts Planning Next Holiday

TEXT:

With the memories of New York in fall still fresh in her heart, a South Betootanese occupational therapy student has escaped her dire financial situation by casually mulling over the possibility of another overseas holiday before the end of the financial year.

Returning from the Big Apple on the first of December, Denise Rochester spoke to The Advocate briefly about her lifelong desire to travel to Japan, which is next on her to-do list.

“I’m trying to keep all negativity out of my life,” she said.

“That’s why we’re not going to talk about the $7400 I still have owing on my credit cards. It’s not going to help anyone if I fritter and worry about that, I can’t control it so why worry about it?”

From the comfort of her parent’s three-seater Ikea sofa, Ms Rochester revealed she fell in love with the former war-mongering nation after she was forced to illegally download Lost in Translation after failing to find it on the Australian version of Netflix.

After watching the film twice in the same week, Denise began hypothetically researching and putting together a humble itinerary for Tokyo.

“The Tokyo Hilton is expensive,”  she said.

“But I’m sick of just lying on the couch, scrolling through Instagram seeing all my friends overseas while I’m stuck in this backwater desert shithole with my parents,”

“Life is too short.”

Rural Teenager Enjoying That Brief Phase Of Adolescence That Isn’t Devastated By Ice

TEXT:

Rural, but town-based, teenager Leon Needham (14) is really enjoying life at the moment.

He’s got a girlfriend, playing A’s rugby in the age group above and is discovering his flair with creative writing.

Down at the river with his dad this afternoon, Leon starts thinking about life after school. Maybe he might move to the city to be a journalist, maybe he might get a job in the agricultural sector…  or maybe, and most likely, he’ll join the 20% of his town who are having their lives torn apart by crystal meth.

While admitting to having been around people who smoke marijuana, and occasionally raiding his parent’s liquor cabinet before a sleep-over, Leon seems oblivious to the fact that he has a much better chance of going to jail before a tertiary institution.

In fact, he has a better chance of seeing the inside of a jail cell for Ice-related crimes than the chances he has of seeing the inside of a domestic aeroplane, or the beach.

Research has found the number of people using crystal methamphetamine, or ice, in rural Australia is more than double the number of those living in metropolitan centres.

The study used national data from tens of thousands of people, and its findings were presented at an alcohol and drug conference in Sydney on Monday.

It reveals crystal methamphetamine use increased by 150 per cent, from 0.8 per cent to 2 per cent, between 2007 and 2013, this number has since increased on average, and in some towns it is as high as 40%.

“I might move to the city and play for the Broncos, like my hero Darren Lockyer!” Leon says cheerfully while reeling in a fish with Dad.

“Or I might be a deep sea fisherman, like my pop was”

Little does Leon, or his Dad, know that in 18 months he will be pressured by hot chicks from the grade above to sniff a little bit of white powder at a post-rugby grand final house party.

And three years after that he will be sent to Arthur Gorrie Correctional Centre for a break and enter on his own parents house.

LOVE IS NOT DEAD: Local Romeo Lets His Partner Rip The Foil Off New Milo Tin

TEXT:

Keen to make up for his many faults and personality defects, a North Betoota carpet layer has broken with protocol this morning and let his young wife take the foil off the fresh Milo tin he picked up last night.

Nathan Decanter told reporters this morning that this was only the start of his Valentines Day plans.

“I’m not sure what else I’m going to do,” he said.

“Pelican Pete gobbled up most of my pay cheque this week so it looks like I’m cooking dinner tonight for V-Day. I reckon Mandy would prefer that, anyway.”

Mandy, who married Nathan last year to great local fanfare, confirmed to The Advocate that she wasn’t expecting much from the big fella this year.

She told reporters that Nathan has a track record of fucking everything up but somehow landing on his feet every time.

“That’s half the reason why I married him,” she said.

“I know he’s probably done something to make himself feel anxious about today. Last year, he put the work ute on its lid while he was trying to swap CDs. He didn’t tell me for a week, said his apprentice gave him the black eyes,”

“Anyway, I’d be happy with a taco mince jaffle with cheese and a back rub. The commercialisation of today is part of the reason why western society is crumbling.”

Yuppies Queue Outside Trendy Bakery For A Loaf Of Bread Like It’s Communist Russia

TEXT:

Despite the oppressive desert heat and sheer expense, a number of local young professionals have spent the morning queuing outside Le Pisse Dans Ma Poche, in Betoota’s Old City, for a loaf of artisan bread like they’re living under communism.

Pete Moorehollande explained to The Advocate this morning from his spot in the line that there’s nothing quite like fresh bread and an iced coffee to take the edge off the Simpson Desert summer.

“After a long steamy night at The Betoota Hotel, betting on cockfights, feeding Pelican Pete and eating pot after pot of bitter, there’s nothing better than hooking into some Pisse Dans Ma Poche,” he said.

“Normally, I’d just visit the local mixed business and pick up some Tip-Top and a pouch, but I won a fucking stack at the cockfights last night. This rooster, let me tell you mate, he ripped one pussy cock to bits and pecked his eyes out. He’ll put my kids through Toowoomba Grammar, that bastard will.”

Located in the heart of Betoota’s famous Old City district, an old fort from the frontier wars, the addition of a French-influenced bakery was initially met with some scepticism.

However, the Betootanese populous has grown to adore the foreign Pisse Dans Ma Poche cuisine – with people from all walks of life taking the time to queue for bread each Saturday morning.

Joining the back of the line is Max Dollarhyde, a local trapper who enjoys the finer things in life, like assaulting people down at the pub and poisoning dingoes and other wild dogs.

The 59-year-old is hoping he’s not too late to pick up one of his favourite damper bacon and egg rolls before they inevitably sell out.

“There’s nothing better,” he said. “Not even a midnight visit from bloody Miranda Kerr. Not that I’d mind that either! [laughs] Yeah, but nah, mate. It’s fucked today, they reckon 50 in the shade, boori?”

“Anyway, joog. Can you go and put some more money in the meter for me, cunt? It’ll cost me more to park here than eat here. At this rate, we’ll be as busy as Birdsville by Christmas.”

“This Magic Button Makes It OK For Me To Double Park Like A Complete Fuckhead”

TEXT:

Pulling up outside his favourite sandwich shop in South Betoota, Graham Frogberk is of the opinion that if you put your hazard lights on, parking like an absolute cunt becomes acceptable.

His heavily-financed burgundy Toyota Rav4 sat in a No Stopping zone for seven minutes while the chinless lump of a 42-year-old galumphed into Wanda’s Wings n Things on Besant Street for his usual Friday morning naughty breakfast.

“I get the beef and black bean sandwich with a hash brown in it,” said the printer solutions specialist.

“It’s such a pain to find a park around there, so I just flick the hazard lights on while I nip it. It over ever takes a minute or two [laughs] People sometimes toot, but I just tell them to fuck off.”

In 2013, however, Mr Frogberk told the wrong person to ‘fuck off’.

In an incident that landed Graham in the hospital for 14 weeks, he was wading back to his illegally-parked car in the swampy Betootanese humidity when he tooted at by Mark ‘Snake’ O’Connor.

Mr O’Connor has served a total of 27 years behind bars since turning 18. The sentence he’s currently serving is for the attempted murder of Frogberk during a road rage incident.

“I told him to fob off and next thing I know, he’s bounced me with the corner of his bull bar. I’ve been launched into the side of my car then squashed and rolled me between his car and mine like a stick between the hands of a bloke trying to make fire the hard way.”

“Then he got out and stomped on my sandwich and said, ‘Who’s the cunt now? You fucken prick!’ It was the most terrifying experience of my life.”

“My doctors said I deserved it though, which was very rude.”

Bill Shorten attempts to cultivate new ‘bad boy’ image by wearing Bailey Nelsons inside parliament

TEXT:

The leader of the Opposition has shrugged off a number of personal attacks from the Prime Minister yesterday by choosing not to remove his sunglasses as he entered the House today.

Bill Shorten was labelled a ‘parasite’ by Malcolm Turnbull yesterday amid a heated exchange during Question Time, to which the PM added that Shorten was also a ‘social climbing sycophant’ and a ‘Toorak rent boy’ – none of which was able to get a rise out of the former union heavy.

“Does it look like I give two fucks about Malcolm Turnbull?” he said. “He said I’ve slid my knees under a lot of Melbourne billionaire’s tables. Ah Hello? Didn’t he have his knees, elbows and shoulders under Kerry Packer’s table? The richest man in Australia? I mean, fuck me, right?”

It’s understood by The Advocate that 49-year-old took a leaf out of Mr Turnbull’s book and made a visit to The Canberra Centre last night where he picked up two pairs of Bailey Nelson sunglasses upon recommendation by Mr Turnbull’s press secretary.

Taking the time to explain to The Advocate this morning, Shorten said that Turnbull’s ‘media boy’ looks like the type of ‘jumped up wine sipper’ that he hopes to personify.

“Turnbull employs the type of androgynous poon that’d pack four pairs of sunglasses for a December business trip to Europe,” he said.

“If that’s what it takes to be a bad boy, then fuck it, what do I have to lose?”

Tongue Simply Not Capable Of Dislodging Food Caught Between Teeth

TEXT:

For 23 year old Hailey Gibbs, today has a been one tenacious struggle with a singular piece of meat lodged between two of her teeth.

After an early lunch this morning it appears a seemingly inconsequential left over meal containing some roast pork, left Gibbs locked in a war of attrition lasting hours.

“Jesus Christ. It was actually impossible to get out,” the young wedding planner explained.

“It just got stuck in between two of my teeth a few back from the front, I honestly spent hours trying to displace it. I couldn’t find a tooth pick anywhere, and could leave the office to find something.”

“Trying to get rid of it took up my whole afternoon, I did zero at work.”

Colleague Sandy Collins said that during one attempted conversation mid-afternoon, with Gibbs, she couldn’t engage her in any way shape or form, as “She was sitting there, moving her tongue around inside her mouth, and nodding “mmmmm, yeahhhhh” to almost everything I said. It was pretty off putting.”

Gibbs says she has been in the situation before, and it is “probably the most frustrating thing that ever fucking happens to me.”

“My tongue is literally numb. I spent the whole afternoon trying to jam the bloody thing between a 3 millimetre gap in my teeth. It’s ruined my day.”

However, “When I finally got it. I can’t even explain the emotion, the relief, it was honestly better than sex.”

Radicalised Neo-Nazi Preparing To Commit Act Of Poor Mental Health

TEXT:

Local Neo-Nazi, Chuck Hindenberg (17), has been radicalised to the point where he is toying with the idea of buying a gun and committing an unfortunate series of events for a political ideology

Much like Islamist terrorists, Chuck has been groomed by online recruiters, who have brainwashed him into thinking that committing tragic circumstances against a minority based on their religion is completely acceptable.

When it comes to the rise of lone-wolf tragic-circumstancists, a lack of a father figure and obvious lack of interpersonal skills are to be first considered when explaining their behaviour, which usually leaves people not alive anymore.

Chuck says that he knows that whatever tragic circumstance he decides to commit, whether it is at a local Mosque or a school, it will only be representative of his niche extremist ideology, and not every single person who shares the same geographical heritage as him.

“It’s me against the world. But I’m going to start with the people that Donald Trump has told me are trying to hurt me”

FOX News reporter, Wyatt Power, says that the actions of tragic-circumstancists can’t be considered terrorism because their ideals are shared daily on mainstream media by politicians and political commentators.

“The tragedies that are committed by people who have been radicalised by the extremist teachings from the nightly news are tragic, yes. But not terrorism.”

“It’s not terrorism if the victims themselves have been politicised to the point where people assume they have radical sympathies”

“Unless those victims are white”

Local Artist Doesn’t Care About Winning Prizes, Or Making Money, Or His Crippling HECS

Local artist, Richie Benowski (29) says he didn’t spend eight years at art school to have to dignify your basic human understanding of aesthetics.

“I didn’t expect you to understand it. I don’t give a fuck if anyone buys it” he spits, venomously.

“That’s not why I do it… To appease the insecurities of bogans in white collars”

While Richie’s newest painting of Barack Obamas appears to be blatantly plagiarised and hard to look at, he says there is a subtext involved in everything he does. And it doesn’t matter if you don’t get it because sometimes even he doesn’t get it.

Having today learnt he didn’t make it into the Archibald Prize, Richie says he isn’t even outraged because of course he wasn’t going to get in because he doesn’t toe the line. Literally, by not entering a portrait of an Australian sitter.

“You corporate types have to dignify everything with a price tag. Just take it in. It’s fucking art”

However, Richie’s parents says they really do hope you like his paintings, because they have costed them around $190,000.

“He says he doesn’t care if anyone buys them. I fucking do” says his old man, Brian.

“What’s the point otherwise. Why have them painting in galleries with price tags?”

“I’ve burnt just about every bridge I have in the art world, trying to help this kid monetise the last decade of his life”

Poor Contribution To Group Chat Followed By 3 Hours Of Silence, Change Of Subject

TEXT:

A group chat of over 20 members has been compromised, after one contributor threw a pathetic couple messages into what is usually a free-flowing conversation between social-media-addicted young adults.

Between screenshots of hot chicks from Instagram and non-stop updates on the odds from different online sports betting markets, a member of the group chat decided to ask if anyone was keen to play touch football with his girlfriend and her work colleagues.

“Oi” he said.

“Anyone want to fill in for my mixed touch team tonight at 6?”

His message was followed by close to three hours of complete silence, with not one vibration or notification until another member asked what everyone was doing on the weekend.

The conversation-killer, a 27-year-old construction development administrator by the name of Jack Scales, didn’t think it was that bad.

“They went pretty cold on me”

This isn’t the first example of poor group chat etiquette making headlines, early last year a local coward made headlines after it was revealed that he had allowed his partner to read through his entire group chat history.

In response to the passive aggressive silence shown towards him, Jack says he was just using the Whatsapp group for what it’s for, communication.

Local mate, Ed, says he’s got rocks in his head if he thinks anyone is going to throw their hand up to fill in for him at mixed-touch so that he can go to the pub.

Cootamundra Not Happy With President Trump For Hijacking ‘The Don’ Nickname

The ‘ropeable’ people of Cootamundra in NSW’s Central-South-West have demanded all media outlets stop grossly misusing the nickname ‘The Don’ when describing American President Donald Trump.

They believe it is bad for tourism, and say they are sick of clarifying to media outlets that their town is the birthplace of Donald ‘The Don’ Bradman, not Donald ‘The Don’ Trump.

Sir Donald George “Don” Bradman, AC, often referred to as “The Don“, was an Australian cricketer, widely acknowledged as the greatest batsman of all time. Bradman’s career Test batting average of 99.94 is often cited as the greatest achievement by any sportsman in any major sport.

Because of this, his hometown of Cootamundra is widely popular for touring cricket enthusiasts, it’s a badge that they believe is being taken away from them.

“How dare they refer to Trump as the Don” says local glassie, Kyal Bourke.

Hopeless Moron Loses Fourth Pair Of Sunglasses This Summer

Waking up late on Sunday morning with the smell of sin still fresh on his breath, Troy Liston noticed that his phone, keys and wallet were neatly placed on his bedside table.

“It’s something that drunk me does as a favor to hungover me,” explained the 28-year-old insurance salesman. “Just something to put me at ease.”

However, it slowly began to sink in that his prized Bailey Nelson sunglasses, which he openly refers to as ‘his Baileys,’ didn’t make the trip home to North Bondi with him the night before.

This is the fourth time this summer that the out-of-control Scorpio has lost a pair of sunglasses – something that his mates will be quick to point out.

“I can’t tell you how I lost them, each time I was next level. Blinder than a bat in a broom closet. But I can tell you that I love shopping for new ones, it feels like a new beginning.”

Account Manager Literally Fucking Dies After Skipping Morning Coffee

A 24-year-old public relations professional who was discovered unresponsive by coworkers shortly before 9 am has tragically passed away in Royal Betoota Base Hospital this morning.

Annie Nerada, of Betoota Hills, was complaining of dizziness and general lethargy to colleagues due to skipping her morning coffee after running late.

Moments before she sat down, the deceased Scorpio confided in her desk mate and told him that she felt like she was about to die – all because she hadn’t had a coffee.

The boutique agency in Betoota’s fabled Upper East Side where Ms Nerada worked has closed for the day, with CEO Miranda Cornwallis and an emergency services spokesmen speaking to journalists about the tragedy earlier.

“At around 1230 EDST, ambulance crews were called to an address in the Old City District in response to a woman found unresponsive at her desk,” said the spokesman.

“The woman was transported to Royal Betoota Base Hospital in the French Quarter, where she sadly passed away some time ago. Our thoughts are with the family at this time.”

Speaking from the heart, Mrs Cornwallis spoke of a highly dedicated and hard-working Annie, who always knew how to get the best for her clients.

“Annie lived and breathed PR. She was a rare breed of person who actually enjoyed working in this field. She always used to joke about how she’d die if she didn’t have her morning coffee. Sadly prophetic, don’t you think? Her favourite client, Coca-Cola, has sent her family a lifetime supply of Fanta.”

Ms Nerada’s family has asked for donations in lieu of flowers to Annie’s favourite charity, her marginally employed boyfriend, Max.

Schooner Now At That Purgatory Where You Could Finish It With One Big Sip If You Wanted To

TEXT:

The ice cold, delicious schooner you bought five minutes ago is now at the capacity where you could finish it in one go, if you need to, it has been confirmed.

If, on the off chance, you are in a position where you need to catch up, or go to another pub, it is believed that you would be able to finish your current beer in one giant gulp – without drawing too much attention.

While it is acknowledged that most adults can finish an entire schooner in one crack, it is considered a bit more appropriate to have a few sociable sips before you put the whole thing away and head back to the bar.

Local punter and close mate, Joe, believes you should ‘neck the rest of that one’ so that he can buy another round, because he has finished his.

“Come on, mate. Put that one away. I’ll get us another couple”

“Are you working at the hospital nowadays… Because you’ve been nursing that one for a while!”

“Ha ha ha”

If you enjoy drinking beer, and enjoy reading the Betoota Advocate, you should consider pressuring your local publican to put The Betoota Advocate’s very own beer on tap at your local. Support regional news through schooners. Go here for more information: BETOOTA BITTER

Tradie Laughed Off Worksite After Buying An Automatic Ute

TEXT:

Locked out of the Yeppoon real estate market, a local tradesman has decided to treat himself the only way a fourth-year-live-at-home-apprentice can these days.

“I got myself a Maloo, mate. Black on black on black,” said Wheeler Kennedy. “She goes like a shower of shit and I can hang the bum out with just the slightest toe on the loud peddle. She’s my beaut-ute! [laughs]”

However, the carpenter wasn’t so chipper this morning when he turned up for work this morning with his new ute. He’d been so excited all summer to finally debut his brand-spanking motor to the boys – but how the boys reacted has got the 32-year-old wanting to return it.

Much to his own personal shame, Kennedy can’t drive a manual.

“It’s not my fault,” he said. “My Dad’s a cabbie and Mum’s banned from driving until 2093. We only ever had clapped out Falcons for me to drive.”

But that hasn’t stopped Wheeler’s colleagues from asking him if he chose to get an automatic because it’s ‘more convenient’ and ‘more practical’ – to which he said yes – to which his colleagues began laughing at him again – even the apprentice electricians.

His friends down the pub have also hung shit on him for opting to pay extra to get the paddle shift.

“It’s just un-Australian,” said a friend. “Why would you sacrifice 65% of your income for an automatic Maloo? Why do they even make them? Who the hell agreed to insure him?”

“There’s so many unanswered questions here.”

Inside One Nation’s Very Organised And Superbly Structured Candidate Vetting Process

TEXT:

Following the dismissal of One Nation’s candidate for the Queensland seat of Bundamba in the upcoming state election – the leaders of One Nation have all made their way to the heartland of their party. Ipswich, QLD.

Dumped One Nation candidate Shan Ju Lin has hit out at the party’s hierarchy over her disendorsement as a candidate in the wake of inflammatory homophobic statements she made on social media.

Pauline Hanson says it is because of this one ‘bad egg’ that snuck through the extremely organised and superbly structured political party’s vetting process, that they have decided to host auditions for the candidacy of each Queensland seat.

“The Asian one was a bit harsh on the gays so we needed to give her the brush” she said.

“Now, we are doing full blown auditions”

“The last thing we want is the exact thing that happened in 1998 when we won eleven seats in Queensland, only to implode on ourselves because no one had any experience”

“I know it’s looking like it’ll happen again, but.. The Muslims!!!”

“Boats. Muslims. Halal. Sharia. Lefty. Boats. Muslims” she roared, in a successful attempt at changing the topic from her party’s obvious lack of professionals.

It is believed that the hopeful candidates will be asked to describe their ideal world, give an oath to Pauline Hanson and take part in a talent show.

Extra points will be awarded to anyone who can play Rose Tattoo on banjo.

Local Mum Under Impression She Also Gave Birth To Family Labrador

Local mum, Annabelle Illet, has been suggesting that her newborn son and 4-year-old labrador are blood related, it has been confirmed through her rampant social media use.

Through posting photos of her son along with the family dog, Bruno, the 32-year-old high-end tupperware saleswoman has led her Facebook friends to believe that she actually thinks she gave birth to both of them.

By using the hashtag #brothers – and referring to them as ‘bros’ – the mother of three real humans is completely ignoring the fact that the dog actually came from a pet store in the Hunter Valley.

Psychologists say she shouldn’t attach herself to the dog in such a way.

“The little woofer is going to cark it in about five years” says local head doctor, Andrew.

“And it’s not just her, the kid’s going to suffer, too. How do you explain to your toddler that his ‘sibling’ has become so old that he can’t hear traffic”

However, Annabelle says no one understands the bond that her ‘sons’ share.

Idol Winner Casey Donavon Allegedly Racing For Pink Slips In Back Blocks Of Tamworth

TEXT:

13-years after Casey Donovan took out the second season of Australian Idol, the 28-year-old performer has taken on a new job that makes the most of her competitive edge. Illegal street racing.

In a new interview with the Daily Telegraph, Donovan revealed she’s picked up work as an illegal drag racer in the North-West NSW town of Tamworth, where she is racing for pink slips part-time to supplement her singing and acting commitments.

“I write music about my own experience and other people’s, so being on the street keeps me raw. I know at the end of the day, the hood still loves me” Donovan told the Daily Telegraph’s Jonathan Moran.

“At least while I’m behind the wheel”

Racing for pink slips: is a popular expression amongst autoracing criminals, used to describe the ultimate bet in terms of personal confidence in an illegal Street race or the like. Two racers put their cars on the line by offering their registration slips as winnings. The winner of the resulting race wins the opponents car for good. This is exhibited in some of the Fast and Furious movies.

Donovan, who has family in Tamworth and initially began her musical career busking there, says she happy to have made such a blatant shift from cutting records to cutting hoops.

“It’s good. I make good coin so I don’t really give a fuck ay”

When asked if she was worried about possibly having her car confiscated and facing jail time for her activities, Donovan claimed she was in no way worried about the repercussions and claimed that ”ail ain’t no thing”.

“You only do two days know how. That’s the day you go in and the day you come out” she said, while smoking a marijuana cigar.

Mum Already Prepares ‘Secret Spice’ For Turkey Stuffing To Prevent Christmas Day Arguments

TEXT:

Linda McGrady’s family is rarely unified on anything, but one thing they all can agree on is that she makes the best turkey stuffing this side of the Tropic of Capricorn.

However, each time they gather for Christmas, sparks fly.

Son Gary’s girlfriend is a Catholic and Linda’s only daughter just got a sleeve tattoo in October and didn’t her family. Combine that with a patriarch who made his crust raising cattle for the E.H. Pearson Cattle Company out at Nappatunga Station and you’ve got a powder keg ready to explode.

“It can be so hard, sometimes,” said the retired high school teacher. “They fight and bicker. Making fun of themselves and saying mean things. Sometimes I only think they put up with each other because I’m still alive.”

But this year, the unsinkable Betoota Grove Rotary Club treasurer has an ace up her sleeve.

She’s got her hands on two 30-pack tablets of diazepam, more commonly known as Valium.

When she goes to make the stuffing next week, she plans to add a tablet or two to the popular dish.

“They’ll enjoy each other’s company and play nice,” she said. “It’s a very hard drug to overdose on. I’ve got some Klonopin for my daughter if the Valium doesn’t take her down. I’ll just put bibs on all of ’em and watch them try to eat lunch.”

“I mean, is it too much to ask to have a nice civil lunch once a year?”

Betoota Grove Police have been notified of Mrs McGrady’s plans to drug her family with power anti-anxiety and muscle relaxant drugs, but are looking forward not responding to another Christmas Day incident at her place.

Morrissey’s Depressing Christmas Resonates With People Who Hate This Time Of Year

Featuring a number of tracks re-recorded for Christmas, British singer Morrissey has released a special holiday album just in time for the big day – something that’s got one Brisbane man excited.

Rather than wait for the midstrength to kick in listening to uncle Pete and Michael Buble compete for the airwaves, Simon Andey (24) of St Lucia stumbled across the album today shopping from presents.

“I’m going to gift it to my brother, I think,” said the Hutchinson Builders project manager.

“Finally, I’ve found a Christmas album that’s on my wavelength. If anybody knows about the commercial hollowness of the holidays, it’s that morose vegetarian from The Smiths.”

Showcasing reworked classics with a big of Christmas cheer, the album features re-recorded versions such as ‘There Is A Christmas Light That Never Goes Out,’ ‘Please Please Please Let Me Get The PlayStation I Want’ and ‘This Charming Santa,’ all proceeds of the record will go straight to Morrissey.

Speaking of which, the 58-year-old musician has remained silent on the release, saying only that he expects it to do well compared to ‘all the other shit’ that’s on offer.

Corporate Woman Adds Spice To Life By Only Dating Emotionally Stunted Degenerates

TEXT:

A professional woman from a gentrified inner-city suburb has revealed she adds excitement to her life by dating emotionally stunted men, new social media posts reveal.

Melanie Wiggs-Smythe, 33, said she sabotaged her otherwise comfortable middle-class existence by avoiding mature men seeking a long-term relationship.

“I have a great job and a lovely apartment with an exorbitant rent – the only thing missing is the frisson of emotional tyranny,” Ms Smythe told 500 of her closest Facebook friends.

“I prefer the challenge of trying to change men who do not want monogamy to the predictability of a stable relationship that has a future.”

Ms Wiggs-Smythe, who also posted an Instagram photo of her at yoga with an inspirational caption about snug-fitting activewear, said she was disappointed “nice” men would occasionally disguise themselves as emotional cripples to get her number.

“I’ve been burnt before,” the mid-level management consultant admitted.

“Now I just wait to see if they text promptly after the first couple of weeks. If they do they are immediately on the ‘no’ pile.”

At the time of going to press Ms Wiggs-Smythe was in an ill-defined “relationship” with a 42–year-old roadie who disappeared on work trips for extended periods of time.

“He said his phone broke and I might not hear from him for a couple of weeks,” she said.

“It just feels right.”

Country Boy Looking Forward To Another January Spent Getting Dumped In The Surf At Mooloolaba

TEXT:

THOUGH HE RECEIVED A life ban from Fridays last year, one Yaraka man has thrown caution to the wind and decided to holiday in Mooloolaba again this summer.

Banned for breaking a pool cue over some Kidman & Co hero from the Channel Country, 28-year-old Juan Decanter swore he’d never return to Australia’s methamphetamine coast ever again, saying he’s slammed the Maroochydore closed for the last time.

But his primal lust for the seaside and dragged him back once again.

The Scorpio revealed to The Advocate this afternoon that if he had to spend a summer getting smashed in the surf, it’d always have to be Mooloolaba.

“I got banned from the Nautilus in Mools for throwing some of the verandah furniture into the pool four storeys below,” he said. “Unfortunately there was a bloke in there having a midnight paddle and didn’t react well when I threw a sun chair at him, so they banned me.”

“Yeah, but nah, joog. Love getting dumped in the surf. Love inhaling VCRs [vodka coke raspberries] at the surf club and switching brains off at the wall when Fridays shuts. Fuck yeah. Drink driving out to the Fish Markets in the morning. Real pissa.”

However, Juan didn’t want ‘us to get him started’ on O’Malley’s and the wanker security staff they hire.

Stating categorically for the record, he says the ‘hole-in-the-wall’ late light institution lost his patronage forever after he was kicked out for throwing a harmless plastic glass at a barman.

“Nah, but fuck that place, but.” he said.

“I can’t even go to the aquarium anymore after we went there a few years back with a gut full of piss and some spearguns. Shot myself a fucking bottlenose dolphin, mate. Dragged the heavy dog back to the Nautilus and put it in bed with my passed out mate. It was a fucken pissa, Bruce.”

Ex-Private School Boys Vow To Never Snitch After Out-Of-Control Mate Smashes Letterbox

TEXT:

While talking to each other as though they run an African-American criminal organisation in South Baltimore, four-to-five ex private school boys, aged between 24 and 28, have made a pact to never reveal to their parents or neighbours about what happened on Friday night.

Alistair, Henry, Nicholas, Fraser and (maybe) William have assured one another that it is all-for-one and one-for-all.

“Don’t tell a soul” says Henry, the leader of the group, who works in finance but still enjoys ‘smoking up’ Nicholas’ family pool house.

“If anyone finds out. We all go down” he says while they meet at a nearby soccer oval.

In what has been described as the greatest controversy to grace Adelaide East Street in the Brisbane suburb of Ascot since Debbie Mallet had and affair with Roger Meares in 1999, the local men, who seem to still live at home, were either involved or witnesses to a disgusting display of vandalism.

It is believed that Alistair, the out of control member of the group, was ‘so drunk on vodka’ that he kicked over the Birley families letterbox, while stating that he thought the third Birley son (Timothy) was ‘shit at footy’.

With the pressure of a classic private school ‘whodunnit’ appearing to affect some of the lads, there is absolutely no room for the weak.

Alistair suggests maybe he should just own up.

“Don’t even think about it, bra!” roars Henry.

“We got your back, bro. Stay strong”

Local Sociopath Enjoys Peeling Men Off ‘My Family’ Stickers To Freak Them Out

ASPIRING COMEDIAN AND West Pymble sociopath, Amanda Greenbolt, says she enjoys nothing more than prowling the streets of an evening to look for soft-roaders with ‘My Family’ stickers on the back window.

When she finds one, she slinks under the cover of darkness into the driveway and uses her gaudy nylon nails to peel the bloke off – just to freak him out when he returns home after a long day of working in the CBD.

“I have this image in my head of this bloke in a mid-level woollen suit coming home at night and seeing him peeled off the back of his Toyota Kluger and think, ‘Fuck! She knows!’ and then he goes inside acting all sheepish,” said the 28-year-old convicted credit card fraud.

After seeing his character removed while arriving home after a very, very long lunch with some clients, he freaked out when he saw he was no longer on the back of this Stuttgart yuppie bus.

“Larry, my ex-husband, burst through the door after seeing that slut’s handwork and confessed that he’d had a bastard with his secretary in 2006 and paid her off. The betray, the lies, all of it.

Know-It-All First-Year Ringer Has Wrist Broken By Kubota

TEXT:

WHEN ASKED IF HE KNEW what he was doing, Graham Conroy said of course he did.

Seeing as though he’d watched all the others do it – even the girls, the 21-year-old decided that he’d have a crack at starting the Kubota, while the everybody else looked on.

Pushing the throttle all the way up, holding in the decompression lever, giving it a few rotations to get some clean air in the cylinder, Conroy slowly began turning the crank handle as the generator slowly gained momentum.

The trick is to stop the hand turning the crank, popping the handle out in one smooth motion as you let go of the decompression lever. However, yesterday afternoon Mr Conroy got a bit confused in all the excitement.

He let go of the decomp lever with the crank still attached to the generator, causing it to take at full throttle.

The crank handle spun once around violently once, collecting the shocked first-year on the wrist, visibly breaking it.

Hearing a sickly shriek come from behind the camp, head stockman Grant Coleman said he turned around on his milk crate to see the Conroy running towards him cradling his now discombobulated arm with his good one.

“Grant, I’ve broken my arm,” yelled Conroy, looking to the boss ringer for help.

“What do you want me to do about it? Does this look like a hospital? Do I look like a doctor?” replied Coleman.

They weren’t, in fact, at a hospital and Mr Coleman isn’t a doctor. They were camped on the side of a sand hill two hours south-west of Betoota, close to Haddon Corner.

Far from the cosmopolitan lights of Adelaide Street, North Betoota. With its village atmosphere and fairy-light studded London Planes. The boutique stores and department chains. Conroy was miles and miles from a hospital and the expertise needed to mend his broken wrist.

“There’s some Herron capsules in my glovebox, mate. Help yourself to two and if it still hurts in the morning, I’ll drive you into town.” said Coleman.

But for the reporters at the Daily Telegraph, it did today.

Not a single shooting occurred in Sydney’s western suburbs.  No gang related violence to speak of. No exciting terrorism raids. Nothing.

While significant events may have occurred in the nation’s capital, or a tip off about corruption in state politics could have been chased up, the high flying adrenaline junkies at ‘the Tele’ spent the day aimlessly milling around waiting around for some seedy underworld interaction to manifest itself.

Reports are that the journo’s at the biggest paper in Sydney began frantically searching for a story towards the end of the day, with anything that included the words ‘of Middle Eastern Appearance’ the sought after commodity.

If nothing comes up, it’s believed some rugby league scandal will have to suffice for tomorrow’s front page.

Head Stockman Reveals Love Of Hitting Dough-Banging Jackaroos With The Jigger

IF YOU’VE EVER BEEN A bit slow off the mark in a northern Australian stockyard, chances are you’ve been called a ‘dough-banging cunt’ once or twice in your life.

But for Gulf Country stockman Nathan Decanter, he likes to put a bit of AC/DC behind his verbal insults.

“Yeah, joog. If you’re not light on your toes in my yards, I’ll give you the jigger,” he explained.

“First time on the bum, then I’ll try to get you on the spine – which can be a bit funny because it can send you legs a bit funny for a while. Then if I catch you again, I’m going for the back of the neck.”

“It’s pretty simple, mate. If you don’t bang dough in the yards, you won’t get electrocuted.”

Traditionally used by the bottom rung of stockperson, cattle jiggers deliver a short but sharp electric shock to help navigate beasts through a set of yards.

Proponents of low-stress handling openly loath the device, but all cattlemen agree that hitting dough-banging stockmen is perfectly acceptable, provided they don’t sook about it.

“That’s the worst, when they get all mundry with you,” explained the 29-year-old.

“I had this one sheila would clip clop up and down the race in her Ropers like she was browsing the selctions at her local Country Target, so needless to say, I got her with the jigger,”

Bloke In Three-Quarter Boardies Still A Virgin On Day 4 Of Schoolies Week

Nigel Griffiths is 18-years-old with the world at his feet.

He’s just graduated from high school, he has a good job lined up with his dad’s mate who works in roofing and he’s in the middle of the best week of his life. Schoolies week and the Gold Coast.

However, despite the endless amount of canned beer and lightweight narcotics, Nigel is still yet to even pop a bonnet.

“I’ve just been drinking too much” he says.

“Like, we all thought that we’d be getting so much sex. Especially considering we paid 900 bucks each for this 4 bedroom apartment at the Beachcombre”

Nigel puts down his lack of romantic encounters down to the fact that he’s ‘having too much fun with the lads’ and that ‘its kind of hard to get chicks in and out of the complex”.

Although the tightened security and over-policing of the school leavers celebrations are very much apparent on the Gold Coast this year, ‘Griff’ isn’t acknowledging the real issue, says his friends.

Close friend and funboy Benny Marsden (also 18) says it has a lot to do with his choice of swimwear.

“It’s the three quarter boardies mate. He looks like he’s the roadie for Blink 182 in the early 2000’s”

“I mean, I know he’s pasty AF, but the girls don’t want to get down with a bloke who dresses like their recently-divorced uncle”.

While Nigel detests his mate’s theory, the fact that their obese mate ‘Kenny’ has already contracted chlamydia from one of his eight conquests all but confirms it. Kenny wears Budgy Smugglers.

“Kenny is sitting at about two roots a day” says Benny.

“He’s atrocious to look at but there’s no denying that volumptuos sunburnt man in banana hammocks is going to fare better than a skinny pale kid wearing below-knee cotton boardshorts”.

Following a special investigation by the Advocate it is now known that the popular service among teenagers is run by Julian Assange and anonymous team members from his controversial whistle-blowing network, WikiLeaks.

“Bongo Knows” is a text based service whereby people obtain scandalous information about friends and relatives for a small fee of $4.95 per text.

For those have often wondered, or asked friends “How does Bongo know so much ?” the answer is now clear.

In what appears to be a mutually beneficially relationship between the two, the documents obtained by the hacking organisation, have been used to let Lucy know who Stephen has been talking to, and much, much more.

While the WikiLeaks arm provides the sensitive information which can make or break fledgling relationships, the revenue raised from the$ 4.95 texts funds the more serious hacking of classified government documents, and the legal bills of Julian Assange.

Assange himself is believed to be spending his days in the confines of the Ecuadorian Embassy running the text line.

Local Tamworth mechanic Phil Dawson will never forgive Assange for what he did to him in high school.

“That fucking bloke went and texted my girlfriend saying I had shagged this other bird behind the science lab when I was in year 11″

“He got it wrong though, we only went to third”

Turns Out That Grape-Flavoured Jelly Bean Was Actually A Liquorice One

TEXT:

Peter Greenholm didn’t just stumble upon a YouTube clip of people graphically breaking bones, nor has he eaten any bad oysters lately.

The 32-year-old people power campaigner accidentally bit down on a liquorice jellybean while catching up on Stranger Things in a darkened room.

Thinking it was a delicious grape-flavored purple bean, he popped it into his gob and started chewing.

Four seconds later, he knew he’d made a huge mistake.

Running for the door, he was caught short. His first regurgitation came up without much warning and plastered the living room door with the mango pop tarts he’d had for afternoon tea.

Struggling to twist the vomit-slicked doorknob, Grossholm finally worked the lock and collapsed on the deck of his parents home, where he still lives.

“This is the worst thing that’s ever happened to me, worse than the time I got caught by the police feeding rice to pigeons then watching them writhe around in agony,” he said.

“Honestly, as a white young millennial male, this is a bad as life can get.”

When asked if he was planning to clean up the mess, Peter said he didn’t plan on it.

“Are you deaf? Didn’t I just tell you what happened to me?”

“Mum will clean it up.”

Dad Confident The Future Is In Good Hands After Using Computer To Make Burger

TEXT:

Lionel Breakspear (53) of South Betoota reluctantly acquiesced to his daughter Sophie’s request to take her to McDonald’s for their father-daughter Sunday luncheon before she returns to university for her exams.

He quite simply didn’t believe me when I said you could now choose whatever you wanted to put on your burger” Sophie said. 

“It’s like he couldn’t associate McDonald’s with anything else but twelvie fights and elderlies using the place for their kaffeeklatsch parties.’

Since Lionel hadn’t set foot inside a McDonald’s since Sophie was playing Netball for the Betoota Egrets, the new layout had him lost for words.

“This is completely different to the tripe Ronald McDonald and the gang served back in my day. But at least you could get a Big Mac for free if you could scat rap that song quick enough.” He said.

“I mean, look at this menu!”

“[whispers] Holy shit”

“What a time to be alive”

“You can get all this fancy stuff like shredded Parmesan and even a bun made out of lettuce! And they give you a number when you order. It’s like they think they’re a café now or something.”

Mr Breakspear’s bewilderment hit a new fever pitch when a waitress came out of the kitchen delivering his burger which included three rashers of bacon and tortilla chips out on a wooden plank. 

A rapidly proliferating trend of the 2010’s he described as ‘urban pansy nonsense for pooncey cunts.’

While it is unclear whether or not this will be enough to prise the patriarch of the Breakspear family away from the weekly Thursday meat raffle and $15 parmigiana special at the Betoota RSL, it will certainly provide food for thought during his lunch break next time Mrs Breakspear neglects to pack him his quotidian snack of six vegemite cruskets.

World-Renowned Brain Surgeon Rattled By High Pressure Environment At Aldi Check-Out

TEXT:

For Stephanie Anderson, high pressure situations are the norm. As a high flying surgeon at the Royal Adelaide Hospital, her days consist of operating on patients whose highly vulnerable lives depend on her steady hands.

But, at 6:30pm last Thursday night, the Aldi checkout experience was just all too much.

After just seconds in, the mother of two began sweeping the goods into her trolley with no regards for the products or the bags in which she had paid money to put them in.

At the exit, in a fluster, Mrs Anderson told the Advocate that the culmination of factors overwhelmed her and she is “bloody glad to be out of there”

“I’m pretty sure I broke a jar of Romanian made pasta sauce but I don’t even give fuck anymore”

“I had planned to load my shopping into the bags in an orderly fashion, but Jesus Christ that girl was just moving them through the scanner at break neck pace,”

“I was backlogged, almost instantly, she was looking at me like I should be going faster, the queue seemed to be backed up a fair way, it just rattled me.”

The not so new kid on the block anymore, Aldi is known for its cheap prices, extremely obscure products, and its unorthodox check-out method, which is known to have frazzled even the most experienced of shoppers.

So much so that Mrs Anderson said she even tried to pay pass the transaction despite it being well over the 100 dollar mark.

“Look its great how cheap it is, but on my salary I’m just going to cop the extra couple of hundred bucks or so for someone to pack my bags at Coles or Woolies”

“Can you imagine if they tried implement a a self serve kiosk” Fuck me”

One Nation Considers Changing Party Name To Remove Arabic Numeral

TEXT:

Federal senator, Pauline Hanson has today met with high-ranking members of her far-right political party, One Nation, to discuss the possibility of changing their party name.

As a staunch opponent to multiculturalism and Islam, Hanson says it’s time for her party to choose a name that reflects the Australia they are trying to create, one that is completely void of any form of Arabic Influence.

“A cab driver in Townsville informed me that the first part of our party name is Arabic. I had no idea” she said while making a cup of Dilmah tea.

“We realised, that if the Arabs can make their way into our party name, then they’ll easily make their way into our country”

Arabic numerals, also called Hindu-Arabic, are the ten digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, based on the Hindu–Arabic numeral system, the most common system for the symbolic representation of numbers in the world today.

The system was adopted by Arab mathematicians in Baghdad and passed on to the Arabs further west. There is some evidence to suggest that the numerals in their current form developed from Arabic letters.

“The Muslimification of Australia is such a threat that they have been deeply entrenched in our party name for over twenty years and I didn’t even know”

The solution, Hanson says, is to rebrand the party entirely.

“We are thinking of using Roman Numerals instead” says the career politician and terrorism expert for Channel 7’s Sunrise.

“I understand Australia has had an issue with Italians in the past, but they are pretty much considered Aussie people nowadays. Something that the Arabs will never be able to do. Not while I’m around”

The proposed ‘new and even more Aussie’ version of One Nation looks to be iNation – taking the Roman Numeral I – which is the ninth letter and the third vowel in the ISO basic Latin alphabet.

However, simply changing the party name is not enough, says fellow [iNation] senator, Malcolm Roberts.

“Surgery, Hospitals and Algebra should also be removed from our political agenda” he said while putting fuel into his Japanese-made Toyota Landcruiser.

“These are Arabic terms of phrase, and quite frankly they are corroding the fabric of our society”

“Case in point, the use of algebra by our corrupt scientists at the CSIRO to help manipulate data surrounding climate change”

“It’s a perfect example of the lefties pandering to Sharia law and the myth of melting ice caps”

Senator Roberts says simple things that many Australians take for granted, such as coffee, carry Arabic heritage – and must be stopped.

“They come here with their coffee beans and their kebabs – and the worst part is that we don’t even know it’s Arabic. it’s just unAustralian”

“I’ve had enough. We’re calling on a ban to all these dangerous things that originated in the Muslim world. This is why we need a Royal Commission – to figure out what is and isn’t Muslim.”

Year 9 kid’s perfectly round hickeys definitely aren’t from his mum’s Dyson

TEXT:

An Untouchable lawyer’s boy from Sydney’s Lower North Shore stepped out of his mother’s BMW this morning with a scarf wrapped tightly around his neck.

Friends of Edward Hatton were curious as to why the renown mad-dog was sporting such an odd accessory in November, so they picked and pried at the 15-year-old A’s rugby player until they finally coaxed the scarf from his throat.

A silence was cast upon that second-period PDHPE theory class like a net over a school of juvenile toadfish.

“Is that a hickey, bro?” asked one friend.

“Nah, bro. It’s two.” replied Hatton. “Got vampired by Annie Portsmythe, lad. At Kelso’s 16th at the boatshed, man. Shit was cash.”

Those in Edward’s friendship circle were immediately enamoured by the tale – all but Shenal Sampson.

Sampson’s suspicions were raised by the perfectly circular shape of Hatton’s hickeys. They were almost too circular.

After confiding in a close friend, Shenal was told not to worry. That Annie Portsmythe’s mouth was circular from her years playing trombone in her school’s orchestra. But that didn’t add up.

Refusing to drink the kool-kid-kool-aid, Shenal took a stand at lunch and accused Edward of giving himself the ‘hickeys’ with his mother’s cordless Dyson vacuum.

“Have any of you boy-kissers ever seen a real hickey? They look like a nine-day-old oyster stuck under your skin. That’s if you get a good one off a public school chick.” shouted Sampson.

“Those are rounder than a twenty-cent piece. You made those with your mum’s Dyson you idiot and we all know it.”

Like when the German Blitzkrieg stormed across the Polish frontier, old friends were forced to pick a side and ride it out. There was no going back.

Some sided with Shenal, others with Edward. Friends were now enemies.

Rove McManus To Be Replaced By MC Kerser After 2Day FM Breakfast Ratings Slump

TEXT:

Southern Cross Austereo’s new CEO Grant Blackley says his Sydney hot hits station can only improve from the record 2DayFM ratings slump.

The once home of ratings-magnets, Kyle & Jackie-O, sits at an underwhelming 2.7 per cent share, down 0.6 points from the previous survey.

“It’s really just Rove. He’s gotta go. We need someone with a bit of presence, but just enough street to keep the westies happy” says the CEO.

“I mean, these ratings surveys are about as inaccurate as you can get, but when you are sitting at the bottom of them, something needs to change,”

Industry insiders are today saying that 2DayFM’s breakfast show with Rove McManus and Sam Frost is at an end. Mainly due to the former TV host’s inability to penetrate radio audiences.

“No one is listening to radio anymore. But if we are going to pretend they are, we aren’t going to do it with Rove McManus on the airwaves,” said one anonymous senior account directors project consultant, who shares a desk in the Austereo bullpen.

“I’m trying to sell breakfast slots to tyre stores in Parramatta. How well do you think I’m going… With a former Bachelor contestant and the poor man’s Eddie McGuire?”

In a bold move by the struggling network, Austereo Executives have decided to replace Rove McManus with Western Suburbs icon and ARIA-topping Australian rap artist, MC Kerser.

The discontinuation of the low-rating, but expensive, duo — with McManus’s contract rumoured to pay $3.7 million per year (although Frost was signed for the much lower fee of $250,000) — will pave the way for a revamped line-up in the hope that a fresh schedule can claw back ratings for the embattled radio network.

“It’s a no-brainer,” says SCA content director Dino Sawyer.

“Kerser is actually relevant to our audiences. He’s got a bit of swag and he’s realistically our best hope at taking down King Kyle.”

“Rove’s not as cute as he used to be. That whole ‘say hi to your mum for me’ stuff doesn’t cut it anymore,”

“We are going to replace him with the Kers’. That way we might be able to put Sam on a decent wage and give our 45 unpaid interns a bit of a hamper at Christmas,”

MC Kerser hasn’t confirmed whether or not he will accept the rumour $2 million per year offer to host breakfast with Sam Frost, but has told one journalist from The Betoota Advocate to ‘stop calling me on private cunt’.

Woman Who’d Never Be Allowed To Work With Kids, Free To Raise As Many As She Wants

TEXT:

Despite the fact that the law would never allow Shonaleigh Madden (24) to work at a paediatric hospital or primary school, she has been given the all clear to give birth to child number four early next year.

The unemployed casual ice user has been banned from driving on Australian roads for the next twenty years and has also been banned from travelling to most overseas countries, after a string of D.U.I offences and violent assaults.

It has also been revealed that not one of Shonaleigh’s ex-boyfriend’s would be allowed to work with kids either, but they are all free to share custody of their respective children.

Speaking to The Betoota Advocate today, Mrs Madden says she doesn’t know who would actually be able to stop her.

“I just have ’em” she said.

“No one has ever come over and sussed me out,”

“I mean I lost my oldest [Tyson, 6] for a few months there because the social workers thought we were cooking ice in here. But he ended up at my mother’s – and kinda just moved back in after a little while,”

“Who the fuck is gonna tell me I can’t have kids. It’s a free country,”

The fact that Shonaleigh would be hands-down denied a working with children permit (blue card) does not seem to concern anyone in her greater community who can tell that she’s about to pop another one out.

Local newsagent, John Harper (55) says it’s not his concern.

“I can’t stop her,” he says.

“It’s got nothing to do with me,”

“But I’ll tell you one thing, when those kids get old enough and start coming in here and stealing shit, I’ll be the first person to have them arrested,”

“It’s really her call. Does she want to be responsible for a bunch of fuck ups? Four kids is a lot of responsibility for someone who doesn’t seem to understand that it’s not appropriate to go to Woolworths without shoes on,”

Stock Photo Model Has No Idea What They Are Going For With This One

Local stock photo model, John Smith (35) has no idea why the hell he is currently wearing business attire and pretending to make a mobile phone call on top of a surfboard in the middle of the ocean.

Speaking to the Betoota Advocate today, he says he’s been asked to do some really weird things over the course of his career as a generic white male, but this is by far the weirdest.

“I have literally no idea what this photo could possibly be used for” he said.

“Like, maybe a mental health pamphlet? Maybe. That’s really pushing it,”

“It’s too bizarre to be funny and it’s just obscure to really be related to any industry. I am lost for words,”

With the shoot expected to take up to two hours, with around eight different variations of this particular setting, John says his career as a model looks like it will be a short-lived one.

“Ten years I’ve spent in the gym, only to be made to look like an idiot for random online clients,”

“This photo will never be used for anything.”

Lonely Maori Bloke Doesn’t Have Black Enough Friends To Bring It In After A High Five

TEXT:

A lonely suburban Maori bloke says he is really starting to miss his cousins, after settling into a boring non-Maori area.

“I don’t even have anyone I can talk about rugby with”

“Like this area is too white for rugby. Can you believe that?” he said.

Dominic Rowe (26) says he longs for the feeling of shaking someones hand at a 40 degree angle, and bringing it in for a light hug.

“It’s so white” he says.

In an attempt to get a bit of spice in his life, Mr Rowe has been colloquially referring to baristas, bar tenders and his own friends as the n-word – a word he feels completely comfortable using as a black man.

However, with mixed ancestry, Dominic realises some people might not immediately identify his ethnic make up – and he has been enjoying testing their political correctness.

Local cafe-dweller Wendy Quilty, says she “just doesn’t..”

“I mean…”

“Can he…”

“Never mind”

According to the white lefties in his new boring white area, Dominic is black enough to get away with doing a high-five and bringing it in, but also white enough to be asked if he enjoys rugby union.

“I don’t really like adhering to their racial stereotypes” he said.

“So, I’ve just been going full bore with the N-bombs,”

“Who’s going to stop me? There’s no other black guys in this area, no ones going to pull me up on the context. I’m just making these hipsters sweat it out.”

New Study Finds 89% Of People Who Can Fix Things Are Named ‘Rod’

TEXT:

A recent study by the University of Queensland has found that 89% of Australians that are capable of fixing trivial but complex workplace and household things, are named ‘Rod’.

Lead researcher, Professor Mal Tuqiri says the study was important for many reasons, mainly because most Australians just assumed that the number was closer to 100%.

“This isn’t necessarily the case,”

“Some are named Roderick, and some actually asked to go by their full name. The same goes for the Rodney’s,”

“But, in almost all circumstances. If something is broken – the bloke who knows how to fix it is going be named Rod,”

“That’s across the board. White goods, office electronics, loosely hung doors, windows frames. The name is diverse in it’s ability to fix things,”

According to a vast number of baby name books from the 1960’s, the name Rod is an English name for men. The meaning of the name Rod is: island of reeds. Also a famous ruler.

The study has also found that over 55% of Australians claim that the first time they ever saw someone smoking roll-your-own tobacco was when one of these Rod’s were called to their house when they were younger.

“Rod’s are renowned for having a quick smoke while mum, dad or the office manager goes inside to call the retailer of said broken thing,”

This is a startling revelation, especially when considering the research program’s August findings that 83% of school front office receptionists are named ‘Deb’.

Professor Tuqiri says their next study will be based around finding out just how many PE teachers are named Pete.

Inconsiderate Moron Lets His Car Break Down And Inconveniences Thousands

TEXT:

GREG MULLHOLLAND PULLED THE nine-volt battery out of his garage buzzer so he’d have something to throw at the man who failed to maintain his automobile to the high standard that every man should.

As he passed Michael Limp, a 29-year-old commission-based printer salesman, he wound down the window of his Ford Trader truck and let it fly. With a dull thud, the battery hit the New Farm resident in the throat.

“Thanks a lot, you stupid moron!” screamed Mulholland. “You fucking idiot!” he added, while maintaining a death grip on the steering wheel, violently shaking himself back and forth in a rage.

“I’ll fucking kill you!”

Without allowing Limp the opportunity to retort, Greg was off into the distance – finally free of the shocking traffic jam caused by Michael’s incompetence.

However, Greg wasn’t the only person on the Bruce Highway north of Brisbane yesterday afternoon who was held up by Michael, the stupid cunt.

Thousands upon thousands of motorists were caught in traffic escaping the River capital up the coast for Boxing Day, with nearly every Queenslander taking the opportunity to give Michael a piece of their mind as they drove past.

“It was quite confronting, to say the least,” explained Limp.

“People were throwing things at me. It was horrible. This one psychopath threw a nine-volt battery at me and it got me right in the throat. It looks like I’ve got a hickey. Don’t know how I’m going to explain that one to the boss,”

“I got a flat tyre so I pulled over as far as I could to change it, but when I got back in to go, the car wouldn’t start so I had to call the RACQ. [laughs] Turns out you have to have the car in park to start it [laughs]. I’m such a dumb arse!” he said.

Controversial Trial Program Of Executing Slow Walkers In City Begins

TEXT:

FROM NEXT YEAR, meandering through the streets of downtown Sydney at your own leisurely pace could land you in the grave.

In a trial program supervised by the NSW Productivity Commission, Premier Mike Baird announced this morning at the opening of the Wynyard pedestrian tunnel, that people who ‘annoy’ others by walking slowly down a footpath run the risk of having their head turned inside out by a sniper’s bullet.

The lifeless corpse will be left in the street to warn others of the fate that befalls them should they become spatially unaware of others. Family members are encouraged to retrieve the body once the smell becomes too pungent for the surrounding businesses to put up with.

“It’s a government initiative that we feel all Sydneysiders can get behind,” said a spokesman.

“We’ll be using a plastic-tip .300 Winchester Magnum round, it’s very humane. However, should we need to take a second shot, for example, if we skim a man’s throat and he’s writhing around on the footpath in a pool of his own blood, there is a capacity to do that,”

“These measures will save the NSW economy $4bn over the next decade, should this program go ahead.” he explained.

According to a government-funded study, slow walkers cost the local economy billions of dollars a year in lost productivity – something that needs to be rectified.

What’s more dangerous? The Adler lever-action shotgun or Kings Cross? We tried to find out

TEXT:

ONE STRIKES FEAR INTO THE hearts of politicians and Jesus freaks across the peasant empire of New South Wales, the other is a potential weapon of mass destruction that has Chardonnay socialists and do-gooders from Brisbane to Bunbury.

While there hasn’t been a recorded homicide committed with the help of the controversial Adler lever-action shotgun, the fact remains that young people have been killed by Sydney’s Kings Cross. However, while the nightlife district is still awash with drug-related deaths, and effort to clean the place up only happened after the two one-punch attacks claimed the lives of two bright-eyed young Sydneysiders.

But claims that the Adler shotgun will unlock the door to another Port Arthur-style massacre are seemingly unfounded, seeing as though it hasn’t killed anybody yet. There’s vehement support for it’s banning – the same type of vehement support there is to loosen the noose around Kings Cross – a known killer of youth.

So to get to the bottom of this, The Betoota Advocate was invited to road test both weapons and make our own mind up.

“This is a gotdam hot bit of kit,” said Muir. “Here mate, have a go!”

Former Senator and Living Australian Treasure, Ricky Muir, invited us to his Sale compound earlier to spin a few yarns and shoot things in his brother’s back paddock. He recently renovated his modest three-bedder in town and what greeted us upon arrival will stay with me for a long time.

“Yeah, that’s the shitter out of my old dunny room,” he said. “Now we shoot things off it, like empty tins and old basketballs and what not. It’s a gotdam great time.”

The retired politician then went onto explain that this isn’t unlike any other lever-action long arm on the market, in fact, he says, this isn’t half as dangerous as other guns.

He doesn’t understand why ‘communists’ and ‘inner-city perverts’ have a problem with the Adler, when many centre-fire lever-action rifles already exist in the market.

“I could walk into Smitho’s Gun Shop downtown and walk out with a lever-action .30-30 and none of those Melbourne neck-rolled pinkos could give a shit. But if I choose an Alder, they paint me with the same brush as martin bryant [Muir asked us not to capitalise his name because he ‘gotdam’ doesn’t deserve it].”

“Stupid it is, mate.”

And we tend to agree with him.

Clancy Overell climbs out of a taxi underneath Kings Cross’ iconic Coke sign and looks up.

“I hate this cunt of a town,” he said, spitting out of the gap in his two front teeth, narrowly missing a Finnish backpacker’s open-toed feet. “There’s just something about it that rubs me the wrong way.”

In response to two ‘coward-punch’ attacks that claimed the lives of two pleasant young men, the premier of NSW put his foot on the throat of Sydney’s nightlife until it stopped kicking – and for good reason.

“Come on, let’s go and find some trouble,” said Clancy.

We arrived in Sydney on Friday morning and immediately put together a plan to scratch the underbelly of The Cross, as the locals call it until it bit us back. The cab driver told us that we’d have a better chance finding a handjob in Mecca than trouble in Kings Cross these days, but we set out to prove him wrong.

Clance and I both bought a fifth of vodka from a bottle shop and inhaled just before 9pm, the time when trouble is on high, so we’ve been told. We then proceeded down Darlinghurst Road until we found one of the last bars open for trade on the strip. The bouncer asked us for ID and queried how our night was going.

“What’s it to you, cunt?” said Clancy. The bouncer laughed and waved us in. It was going to take more than that to get our heads kicked in it seemed.

As we walked in, a small group of Irishmen made a wry comment about our hats. I walked up to the biggest one, removed my hat and head-butted him while Clancy came in over the top and threw a haymaker at the ginger.

Twelve hours later, I woke up handcuffed to a bed in St Vincent’s Hospital without much memory of what happened. Clancy was nowhere to be seen – and I still haven’t seen or heard from him since we walked into that sports bar 16 hours ago.

Kings Cross is a cesspit and should be burned to the ground. If you want a nightlife, go to Melbourne and stay there. The Adler is fun and harmless if you don’t have mental illness, leave it alone. It’s way safer than Kings Cross. Mike Baird is a martyr.

‘Marriage is a sacred institution,’ says man whose third wedding was in a casino

TEXT:

Though now she’s only a memory, Darren Loaf tied the knot for a third time in December 1990, surrounded by friends, family and people just trying to enjoy a tropical North Queensland getaway.

Tragically, only a few months after they got hitched at a Townsville casino, the then 38-year-old pearl diver was forced to kick wife Deidre ‘out on her arse’ for reconnecting with an old flame.

“That’s the good thing about being Protestant,” he said. “You can always get another one if you wear the one you have out.”

Speaking to The Advocate this morning, Mr Loaf (64) said that while he agrees that marriage is a sacred act between a consenting man and woman, he wanted to emphasise that sometimes it just doesn’t work out.

“Take for example that fucking show that’s just finished. Full of perverts with neck tattoos, what’s the one? Yeah – Married At First Sight. Terrible fucking television, but case in point mate,” he said.

“You can get a bloke and some sheila together on the day and they could live together forever. That type of thing happens in India and other countries of that flavour all the time. But you make two blokes stick together forever, in a legal contract? You’ll get fireworks there,”

“And all of my divorces have been pretty straight forward. I just write a cheque and they’re off into the sunset. Could you imagine two blokes going through a divorce? Fuck me dead, mate. They’d be fighting over squares of dunny paper and that’s not healthy for society. I say fuck it, leave it how it is. If they want to get married, then they can hoon off to some socialist paradise like Ireland or America.” he explained.

The Cairns local is currently single and openly admits he’s on the market, but that doesn’t mean he’s looking for love.

“Look, if some bit of kit still wants a nigh-on-seventy-year-old-man like me, who lives in a caravan in this sweltering shitnest then tell ’em where to find me.”

Experts Find People Of African Descent 90% More Likely To Pull Off Bluetooth Headsets

TEXT:

Jawbone’s hands-free bluetooth headsets only really look good on black guys, it has been confirmed by scientists from the CSIRO.

Speaking to the Betoota Advocate today, 10-year CSIRO veteran Professor Becky Wither-Goodhare says that while black women can also pull off a Jawbone, it is mainly males who work in finance or sales.

“You remember Idris Elba in the Wire?” she said.

“That’s what we are talking about. That and Denzel in Man On Fire,”

The Professor says people need to think really carefully before debuting a hands-free bluetooth device, pointing out that it is a very hard accessory to pull off.

“White men who wear hands-free headpieces end up looking like drug dealers or used car salesmen. White women who wear them tend to look like pyramid scheme,”

“Asian people can’t do it either because of Lloyd from Entourage”

In January 2011, Jawbone’s fifth Bluetooth headset, Jawbone Era was announced. It was the first to have a built-in accelerometer and motion sensing software. It functions via motion commands which involve shaking or tapping the headset twice to answer, end, or switch calls.

Professor Whiter-Goodhare says when white people use the motion sensing software and tap on the side of their heads, they look neither efficient or cool.

“They tend to look like they are bit loopy… You know, school shooter type stuff,”

“This kind of look only really looks good on black guys in tailored suits”

Meet The 18-34 Year Olds That Agree With Lock-Out Laws, According To Fairfax

TEXT:

According to an exclusive Fairfax poll, majority of NSW voters say the controversial “lockout” laws in Sydney’s centre should be extended across the state, and three-quarters of young people support support extending the 1.30am “lockout” and 3am last drinks in force across Kings Cross and parts of the CBD to the rest of the state.

However, many statisticians and maths professionals have spoken out against the wild findings, stating that the only people surveyed were done so on landline phone calls – rendering them completely out of touch with society.

USyd Maths professor, Dr Brian Vo says that Fairfax shouldn’t be the organisation in charge of sourcing these findings, especially when considering that they have been selling ads in their newspapers based off the fact that they were able to ‘create the lock-out laws’ in the first place. (www.newsmediaworks.com.au/enough-is-enough/)

“It seems like a conflict on interest,” says Dr Vo.

“They are selling themselves as a campaign agency essentially – and on top of that they are now force-feeding grandmothers warped statistics that suggest they were on the right the right side of history when they invented the word ‘coward punch’ and sold their souls to CBD property developers.”

However, despite the criticisms of unlawful conduct and manipulated statistics by the NSW state government – as well as their close friends at Fairfax news – The Betoota Advocate has made a point of contacting some of these respondents from the 18-34 year old demographic, just to be sure.

We spoke to Clarence (18) a former Real Estate agent who, for whatever fucking reason, decided to retire in Kings Cross five years ago.

“As a young person, I am very relieved to see Kings Cross filled with 24-hour-gyms and juice bars. When I first moved here, it was really annoying to hear all those discotechs blaring until the early hours.”

Clarence says the idea that young people need to socialise and listen to music on their weekend’s is simply archaic, and as young person he has plenty of fun in his spare time. Clarence’s interests include playing golf at the Royal Sydney golf club and covertly donating large sums of money to One Nation.

Another respondent, Wendy (24), also from Sydney’s inner-east says the lock-out laws have restored her faith in the power of God.

“I knew Mr Baird would be the one to fix this broken city. I used to shudder when I would see all these unwed young women walking around my suburb wearing mini-skirts after dark,” she says.

“Not to mention all of the blacks,”

Another Potts Point resident, Bruce (20) says young people who complain about lock-out laws have no idea about life in the city.

“Anyone who criticises this government for their actions has no clue about the perils faced by those who decided to buy three negatively geared terrace houses in Darlinghurst ten years ago.”

“It’s about time. All of these bearded homeless people out on my streets… Get rid of them I say,”

Fairfax news has refused to respond to our requests for comment about warped statistics, but have inquired whether or not we want to advertise on their dwindling newspapers, before providing us with a portfolio outlining their ‘Enough Is Enough’ campaign – a hysterical series of front pages that brought about the lock out laws.

Private School Mum Easily Mistaken For Inner-City Lesbian

TEXT:

While her fashion sense and hairstyle seem completely heterosexual amongst her social circle, 46-year-old Northern Beaches mum Sandra Spacey is often mistaken for a lesbian from Sydney’s inner-west – every time she crosses the Harbour bridge.

The mother of three, and die-hard member of the Newport Surf Club, is unaware of the fact that most people on the CBD side of Sydney Harbour immediately assume she works in the restaurant game and campaigns for animal cruelty charities in her spare time.

Speaking from the hill at Brookvale oval yesterday afternoon, Mr Spacey says she is often puzzled why she is always handed marriage equality pamphlets when shopping for new cargo jeans in King street.

“I don’t go down to Newtown much, but people always act like they know me,” she says.

“It’s a really groovy place,” she says.

As Sandra points out, her extremely androgynous, cropped jet-black hairstyle isn’t as easily accessible on Sydney’s Northern Beaches.

“There’s a few too many of the platinum blonde bimbos doing the foil and curl thing up at home,” she says.

“I need to take the Subaru down to Newtown to get a bit of oompf. Those girls at Lick ‘n’ Flick barbershop really now what they are doing,”

With her son about to run on for under 16’s and her friend Stacy just returning back from the canteen with a bottle of Yellow Glen, the multimillionaire wife of a roofing magnate says the only thing wrong with Newtown is all the freaks.

“There’s a bit too much going on there” she says while taking off her birkenstocks.

“I prefer it up here. Much less of the riff raff and crazy outfits,”

Brisbane Girl Living In England Now Says “Yeah?” After Every Sentence

TEXT:

Born and bred Brisbane girl, Anna Wilson (26) has today unveiled the most embarrassingly contrived faux-English accent since Don Cheadle appeared in the first Ocean’s Eleven film.

While insisting that she doesn’t know what you are talking about, Anna is making a very obvious effort to alter her inflexions and to not finish sentences with the word “aye”.

This shocking identity-shift comes after the 26-year-old yet-to-be-employed media professional ticks over her second month as an Australian abroad.

Anna is living in London. Or as she now pronounces it “Lundahn”

Speaking on the phone to a close friend this morning, Anna does not realise that her newfound accents sounds very much like a young woman who grew up in Moorooka, QLD – attempting to sound like she grew up in Fulham, UK

“I don’t n’hoh whaht you’are tawlking abowt, Dahrling,” she says, after being asked what the go is.

“M’hy voyse hasn’t changed at’all”

While friends and family pray that this new facade is nothing more than a phase, they find consolation in knowing that Anna has not yet changed her uniquely Brisbane fashion sense.

Close friend, Margot Bowler (25) says she was relieved to see Facebook photos of Anna still wearing the staple Brisbane outfit of a brightly multi-coloured muumuu and a bee hive hairstyle, with thick gold jewellery.

“It is a relief,” says Margot.

“And I heard she’s still been leaving the pub with stocky blokes wearing leather dress boots and tucked in checkered shirts – so it’s really no different to her being in Brisbane,”

“It’s just this accent. I hope it doesn’t last”.

Study Finds 83% Of School Front Office Receptionists Are Named Deb Or Debbie

TEXT:

A recent study by the University of Queensland has found that a vast majority of primary and secondary school front office receptionists go by the name of ‘Deb’.

The research, which was conducted at the St Lucia campus, sampled a school from each local council across both NSW, QLD and WA.

UQ Professor Mal Tuqiri says that when it comes to volunteer roles within the Australian school system, most of the blue-card carrying women rotating through the front of office of any given school, usually go by the same name.

“What we have found is that 83% of front office receptionists in Australian schools are known as either ‘Deb’ or some variation of ‘Deborah'” he says.

Deborah (Hebrew: דְבוֹרָה‎‎) is a feminine given name derived from דבורה D’vorah, a Hebrew word meaning “bee” – a fitting origin for the name, considering how busy the modern wave of Deborah’s are, between organising school fetes and keeping an eye on the kids that have been sent to the principals waiting room.

Deborah was a heroine and prophetess in the Old Testament Book of Judges. In the US and Australia the name was most popular from 1950 to 1970, when it was among the 20 most popular names for girls.

Professor Tuqiri says the current generation of Debs in Australian school front offices are the most influential ever.

“They are very involved in their local school and are always given a huge bouquet of flowers at the speech night awards because of their selflessness.”

“They almost always cry during these ceremonies, because they love those kids,”

Professor Tuqiri has also stated that most Australian schools couldn’t run without Debs. He points out that they play many roles within the confines of the school fences.

“Nearly all of them are volunteers, but some do get paid. It really comes down to how much of a Deb they are. Some will help out with athletics carnivals as well, the ones that put in the extra Debs end up on the payroll”

“Australian kids would be at a loss without these Debs, sometimes Debbie if they have a more bubbly personality”

Local Culinary Whizz Spends Two Hours Cooking One Of Jamie Oliver’s 15 Minute Meals

TEXT:

EACH MORNING BEFORE WORK, Graham Watkins looks at his coconut-flavoured jellybean of a body in the mirror and ponders whether he should wait until his first cardiac episode before he makes any lifestyle changes.

Last night, he decided to make a change.

The 25-year-old’s usual Friday night dinner was more often than not a toasted sandwich, complete with taco mince and some leftover cheddar. He agrees it was fine when he was a younger man, but lying on the couch having heart palpitations watching the 7:30 Report each night was not what he had in mind for his future.

Graham’s mother, Gale (64) gave him a hardcover edition of Jamie’s 15 Minute Meals for Christmas last year, which has done nothing except collect a thin layer of grease and dust on the shelf above the toaster.

“I thought, ‘Fuck it, I’ll give the bloke a go,” said Watkins.

“Half an hour isn’t long when you consider what you get the end of it. Last night, I had a flick through and decided on making this Spanish chicken bullshit where you wrap the fucking thing up with stuffing and the whole shebang,”

“Good practice, though. Because last fucking night, it took a bit longer than half a fucking hour. I ate dinner at like 9pm. That’s Spanish alright. Imagine if I was cooking for someone else? It was good, but.”

But that wasn’t just the end of his night of troubles which began with him not having any cumin, Moroccan five-spice or a tajine.

Every knife in the house was also blunt because he lives with people who ruin nice things. When asked by The Advocate if he’d do it again, Watkins said he would not.

“I mean, if the bloke said they were two-hour meals like they fucking are, then maybe I’d have a go once a quarter or so, you know?” he said.

“But as for every night, he can go squat on a cricket stump. Cooking dinner last night wasn’t fun at all. I’d rather have a stroke at 30 than do that every night.”

31-Year-Old Unsure If His Alcoholism Is Still Legendary – Or It’s Starting To Get Sad

TEXT:

There was only one wedding invitation on his fridge in December, now there’s seven.

It’s not because Jack Regent is particularly popular, nor is he being dragged kicking and screaming to them. The 31-year-old has seven wedding invitations on his fridge because he’s 31-years-old.

But that’s not phasing Jack, because he’s still a bit of a mad dog. Every wedding he’s been to, the boys always look to him to organise the bags of Nosé and some valium for the next day.

He’s a loose unit.

However, as all of his friends begin to settle down around him, the term deposit specialist has started wondering if his hedonism is still legendary – or are his mates starting to feel sorry for him?

“Look, mate. If I was 29 still, I’d still be going to these weddings, getting blind and leaving hotel rooms looking like a painter’s radio,” he said.

“But the reality is I’m not getting any younger… and what I do twice a week, half the boys would be lucky to do twice a year now. It’s pretty grim. But I’m not sure if it’s getting grim for me or getting grim for them. Know what I mean?”

“I do get these moments of clarity, like when I’m having nose beers in a nightclub toilet on a Thursday night. Walking out of the cubical and look at myself in the mirror, I’m like, ‘What the fuck are you doing with your life? Haven’t you called your parents in over a month? You’re a fucking monster’ but then I just chalked it up to being really high and shrug it off.”

For now, Mr Regent says he’s content with being a grub, but looks to try being a coupled man in years to come.

Identity Crisis Peaks As Local Man Arrives At The Pub Wearing 2008 School Rugby Jersey

TEXT:

In what has been labelled a desperate cry for help, Hugh Collins-Allen (26) turned up for a night out with friends wearing his Scox Grammar First XV rugby jersey from 2008.

Having completely failed to establish any form of adult identity in the preceding seven years, Collings-Allen reportedly chose the jersey ahead of his regular Industrie ‘going out shirt’.

“I don’t get why everyone’s going on about it.” Said the part-time pool shop attendant who lives inside his parent’s ‘granny flat’.

“We were the best side the school’s produced in decades!”

“Anyone who says it’s stupid has obviously never represented their school at the highest level.”

However, Collins-Allen’s mates were less than enthusiastic about his special blue and gold jersey.

“It’s pretty embarrassing to be honest,” said Oscar McCallum (26), fellow Scoxonian and childhood friend of Collins-Allen, who was wearing a salmon-pink polo shirt. “School finished six years ago, mate. Most of us are working full-time now. I mean, I’m at Macquarie!”

“We were going to head into the Uni strip to try and hook up with some alternative chicks. Now we just look like private school wankers.”

McCallum went on to label Collings-Allen a “sad cunt” and even called into question his friend’s rugby career.

“The dickhead mostly played twos anyway. Only got the call up ‘cos Sheepy did his achilles against Wavilton.”

Collings-Allen reportedly left the pub early to attend the 17th birthday of a Presbyterian Ladies College student.

Brisbane man says ‘Sorry Mate’ 72 times in Sydney nightclub

TEXT:

Knowing full well what the consequences are for slipping up on a night out in Sydney, Junior Leaupepe spent half of Friday night apologising for entering somebody else’s personal space.

The 29-year-old Indooroopilly buyer’s agent arrived in Sydney late on Friday afternoon, where he was met at the airport by his old mate Dave, who made the move down to the harbour capital in 2011.

He warned him that things in Sydney weren’t like they were back in The Valley.

“He told me to take it easy. Sydneysiders don’t appreciate the types of debauchery that come hand in hand with growing up on the banks of the big brown snake,” he said.

“He said I should be honest with bouncers and apologise for everything,”

“So I thought, ‘No problem’ and didn’t think of it again. Until we went out that night.”

Recalling all the times when he’d go to The Met as a teenager, throwing drinks on the gogo dancers in the birdcages and urinating in dark corners, Junior knew that wouldn’t fly.

Choosing the most Sydney experience for Junior’s first night in town, Dave took him on a tour through the city’s east – culminating in a last stand in the Oxford Street precinct.

Thinking he’d see a slice of the human condition that he’d never seen before, Dave said he wanted to show Junior the real Sydney.

“Well. I took him up and down Oxford Street because you don’t see blokes kissing in the street in Brisbane. It would be a treat for somebody like him. We didn’t see any, just two guys going at it in between two beemers in Surry Hills,” said Dave.

“Then we went down off the street, down these stairs into a club,”

“There was only like 11 people in it on a Friday night, but Junior made the point of apologising to each of them. He also said he was sorry to the door bitch, DJ, floor staff and bartenders,”

“It was very Brisbane.”

Local Man’s New Friendship From The Weekend Bolstered By 140 Of His Closest Mates Liking It

TEXT:

After an embarrassing but perfectly executed example of mob mentality, local man Dominic Locke (25), says his chances of entering into a relationship with a bird he met through coworkers are now non-existent.

Dominic had only met Ms. Wesser twice before at after-work functions, but following a warm and friendly conversation on Friday night, he felt confident enough to request her friendship on Facebook while travelling home in an Uber.

However, after waking up this morning, Mr Locke was horrified to find that a vast amount of his male Facebook friends had ‘liked’ their new friendship notification.

“It’s really beyond a joke. 140 people? That’s like an entire football club” he said.

“Half of them don’t even know me that well. Actually some of them I don’t even know at all…”

With male facebook users from high school, university, his football club and work friendship circles deciding to make things awkward for Dominic, he feels as though he has no choice other than to delete her friendshipon Facebook and hope to never see her again.

“2nd grade colts at my footy club were getting involved in that,”

“She either thinks I’m a serial killer or a full blown battler. 140 fucking likes!?”

While Mr Locke does acknowledge a lot of the attention might be a result of Ms. Wesser’s provocative ‘hotdogs or legs’ cover photo, he says he has no idea what to say to their mutual friend Stacey when he is back at work on Monday.

“How the fuck do I explain that?

“I feel like I’m intimidating her – It’s like I’ve been involved in a sex tape scandal,”

“I don’t even know Stacey that well. This has really fucked me up.”

The Betoota Advocate approached Kerri-Anne for comment but she accused our reporters of “invading her privacy” and told them that she didn’t need this stress.

Local Court Convicts Man Of Drink Driving In A Pair Of Heely Shoes

TEXT:

THINKING HE WAS THE smartest man in the world, friendly North Betoota piss wreck Deverell Slacks ordered a pair of Heely shoes online to wheel himself home from the pub each night.

He’s disqualified from driving until 2070 – a result of being pinged for DUI over twenty times.

Left with no other option, as his last DUI charge came from riding his son’s Sector 9 longboard home from the bowling club.

Prior to that charge, Slacks was convicted of operating a horse while intoxicated and public urination.

“Nobody told me that you couldn’t ride a pony home blind,” he said.

“And the public urination charge came from the fact that the cunt of a thing wouldn’t let me off without shying away like the fucking thing it is. So I just flopped it out and pissed down its shoulder. Then the fucking cops turned up and fuck.”

But then the casual woodwork teacher had a brainwave.

He’s seen some kids down in more cosmopolitan parts of the state, such as Ipswich and Logan, wearing this flash shoes with wheels on the bottom of them.

So he ordered some online and before he knew it, he was wheeling himself around town.

Though now he’s sporting twin broken wrists after failing to get the hang of it straight away, he thought he’d finally outsmarted the local policeman.

“Turns out getting a gutful of piss in you then pulling on your Heelys for the ride home is against the law,” yelled Slacks.

“And it’s bloody hard to stay upright on those bastards after you’ve had a couple. I’m always swooshing me arms around like a willow tree in a windstorm, trying to keep me balance,”

“Look at the state of me though, mate. I’ve got two broken wrists and bark all off up my arse and legs. These fucking Heelys will be the death of me. I’m too old to keep falling over like some drunk punk kid.”

Late last night, Deverell was charged with DUI after being found Heely-ing down Duckworth Street in North Betoota. Police say he was covered in gravel and bleeding from the scalp when he was pulled over.

He blew .145 and later registered .159 at the police station.

His rooted pair of Heelys were confiscated by authorities and impounded until Mr Slacks pays his outstanding fines.

Phoneless Gent Forced To Read 17-Year-Old New Idea In Dentist Waiting Room

TEXT:

AFTER PICKING UP AN old issue of New Idea at his local dentist, Blake Mickley agrees that there certainly was some crazy shit happening in the world of celebrity back in 1999.

His epiphany was only made possible by the 23-year-old accidently leaving his phone at home, realising his error half way to the dentist – he decided that he’d be able to tough it out without it.

“Here I am, just dropping in get my palate expander widened and I’m learning about Michael Jackson’s financial woes. Do you know how much that fucking chimp cost him? Half a mil a year! I’d have tapped the cunt on the head before I got him out of the car!” he yelled.

“Then in another article in this magazine said that Tom Cruise and MJ ate the chimp later on? Wonder what it tasted like?”

“But yeah mate, back to the point. It’s bloody weird, hey? I’m certainly not across celebrity, but even I know that this is all crap. My Mum used to buy it every week for some fucked reason. I don’t get it, it’s not even real? What’s the point of reporting on something that didn’t happen?”

Among the other magazines on offer was a National Geographic from 1984 that forewarned that the Earth was getting too cold and the polar bears were freezing to death.

A rare copy of the Financial Review was also described by Mickley as advising their readers to get out of property before the crash in prices back in 1997, saying that investing in housing is a “mug’s game”.

However, it’s not all doom and gloom according to the law clerk, who says he’s going to ask the dentist for some serious drugs to numb the horrible pain of having your palate widened by a sadistic bit of plastic and stainless steel.

“I’ve got some good vapourwave to listen to when I’m muzzing out tonight on whatever he gives me,” he said.

“If he doesn’t give me anything, I can just swing by a couple pharmacies on the way home and pick up a few boxes of codeine tablets. They work alright, but I’m really holding out for some OxyContin.”

Put The Kleenex Away: First Non-Depressing Australian Film Since ‘Red Dog’ Announced

TEXT:

NOT SINCE THE RELEASE of 2011 feel-good hit Red Dog have we had such reason to celebrate.

Screen Australia was able to confirm this morning that the successful movie’s sequel Red Dog: True Blue wasn’t intentionally bleak, depressing or sad in any way.

The news has led to an outpouring of emotion, with thousands taking to social media to belatedly thank the movie’s producers and writers. Australian audiences have longed for the relatable comedy for what seems an eternity.

Prior to Red Dog, the last palatable Australian comedy was The Dish. Like it’s radio satellite namesake, it stood alone brave and tall on the Australian film landscape as the last bastion of fun before the dark ages.

Film executive Grant Sackerman says he only had to open his ears and listen to those around him before he gave the Red Dog: True Blue the green light back in 2015.

“I don’t know how I didn’t see it earlier,” said the 43-year-old.

“Who in their right mind would pay $19 to go see a movie like Jindabyne? Fuck me! You’d walk out of the cinema and straight under a bus. Don’t even get me started on Tomorrow, When The War Began, that made me want to drive my car into the creek for a whole month,”

“Then we did snuff films like Wolf Creek and shit. Mad Max doesn’t count because Americans like it. Australian cinema was about as fun as visiting a parent, who’ll never recognise you again in a dementia ward.”

Mr Sackerman’s sentiments have been echoed by professional movie critic David Stratton, who agrees that the nation and indeed the world has been crying out for more Australian comedy films.

He says you’d be forgiven for thinking that he’d enjoy the more mentally stimulating Aussie flicks of the past two decades like Shine or Lantana but you’d be wrong.

“My favourite Australian movie of all time in Paperback Hero with Hugh Jackman and Claudia Karven. I just adore it. I didn’t want to tell the whole world when I was reviewing films that my favourites were the simple ‘mind popcorn movies’ like Paperback Hero,”

“Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles was my pick of the trilogy. The Wog Boy 2: Kings of Mykonos should’ve been screened at Sundance.”

Banksy unveiled as former Howard foreign minister Alexander Downer

TEXT:

ONE OF THE GREAT MYSTERIES of the 21st century has been solved by a team of London journalists this morning – the identity of world-renown guerilla vandal Banksy.

The investigative team will allege that Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, Alexander Downer, is the artist.

Using a series of scientific algorithms, the journalists were able to pinpoint when each new Banksy artwork would appear, which ended up coinciding with Downer being in the area.

Downer has returned fire at the journalists, saying that it’s absurd to think a square like him could ever do something as illegal and altruistic as what Banksy does.

“Absolute pish-posh,” said Downer.

“Yes it might be a coincidence, but there’s no way anybody in their right mind could believe that I’m Banksy. Mr Brainwash maybe, but certainly not Banksy.”

Adding fuel to the fire, his former boss John Howard said that there’s every chance in the world that his long-serving foreign minister could be the street artist.

Howard observed Downer doodling in the margins of his diary – and they were often politically charged.

“Once I saw Alex drawing a picture of Kim Beazley as DK from Mario Kart, except he’d just run over a banana. His hands were flailing above his head and he was going apeshit,” said Howard.

“We used to play lots of Mario Kart at Kirriblii House before 9/11. Then we had to take things a little bit more seriously. But yeah, it wouldn’t surprise me if he was Banksy.”

The famous pieces of street art began appearing in 1990, during Downer’s first official trip to the United Kingdom as an elected member of parliament.

Banksy’s first known large wall mural was The Mild Mild West painted in 1997 to cover advertising of a former solicitors’ office on Stokes Croft in Bristol – just months after the big South Australian became foreign minister.

“I’ve never even been to Bristol,” said Downer.

“Although I was in the UK at the time, that’s just a coincidence.”

Pleasant Bushie Applies For Passport For Upcoming Trip To The Seaside

TEXT:

IT WAS ONE SMALL STEP FOR Nathan Delaney to get a mobile phone, it was a giant leap for him to turn it on.

“Fuck me,” he said. “Look at this fucking thing. How do you drive it?”

While Nathan may be taken back by his new Motorola, what lies in store for the 24-year-old borderline illiterate station hand will blow his young mind.

His travelling confidence was struck a blow at an early age when his country boarding school principal referred to Nathan and his friends as “DFRs” or “dumb fucking rurals”.

He really took it to heart.

“What would that wok-eyed cunt know about me? For a while, I didn’t think I’d have what it took to go to the city, but you know what? Fuck him. I’m going. I’ll send the bastard a postcard when I get there, too!”

Nobody batted an eyelid when he asked his aunt’s friend down at the Bedourie post office for a passport application, but they were surprised when he told them he just wanted to visit Brisbane.

“I’ve got some holiday time coming up,” he said. “The boss man said I should visit the seaside. Said there’s water as far as a bloke like me could see.”

So he did.

Delaney’s passport arrived earlier this week and the boy from the desert was off to Brisbane. It was the first time he’d been on a plane with two engines.

After boarding the aircraft in nearby Longreach, Nathan demanded to see the pilot. Just prior to taking off, he produced his passport and gave it to the pilot.

“Just wanted to make sure I didn’t get into trouble and all my papers were in order,” he said.

The pilot just kind of smiled and looked at the stewardess before returning to the cockpit. Upon landing, Nathan also handed his passport to various members of the airport staff, including a fast food worker.

“The Qantas fellas were real nice to me. Made sure I wasn’t shit worried about anything.”

Arriving this afternoon in what his worldly brother describes as Australia’s Amalfi Coast, Nathan wasted no time making a beeline from Brisbane Airport to Wynnum, on the River City’s eastern tip.

“This water tastes like shit,” said Nathan, who’d taken off his Ariats and rolled his jeans up. For the first time in his life, he was standing knee deep in the Pacific Ocean.

“These fellas have a salt problem around here.”

Flicking through a few brochures from tourism operators, the desert resident wasn’t sure where to start.

“There’s so much I want to do. I’ve only got three weeks in Brisbane and I don’t think it’s enough,” he said.

“I’d like to visit Seaworld and conquer my fear of dolphins. The sound they make pulls yesterday’s lunch out of my colon quicker than a Johnny can drag a stuck cow out of a bore drain. EEEE EEEEE EEEE EEEEEEE!”

“It’s like two styrofoam boxes rubbing together.”

The Advocate will continue to follow Nathan Delaney’s journey in the coming days.

Bucks Party Was Pretty Quiet, According To Heavily Curated Photo Album

TEXT:

Local primary teacher, Amelia Thorne says she is very surprised that her fiancè, Nicholas Stuart, decided to celebrate their upcoming marriage with such a low-key event.

“It blew me away. They must be getting a bit old” laughed Amelia, after spending fifteen minutes perusing the twelve photos that Nick’s brother was able to capture over the weekend.

“A bit of golf, and then they went out on the boat for a bit and ended up finishing the day at a Chinese restaurant for dinner,”

“His brother is usually the wildest guy at any party, and his photos were pretty tame in my opinion,”

However, Nick’s version of events differs slightly to what is presented in the photo album his brother emailed to Amelia from the airport on his way home.

“Yeah, from all accounts, the day was not that tame at all. I don’t remember much but I do know that there was a bit goin’ on,”

When asked about how his brother, Brendo, was successfully able to present the 29-hour bender as some sort of polite outing, Mr Stuart says it’s because he’s a “f**king pro at this shit”.

“Mate, I’m pretty sure that ‘Chinese Restaurant’ was actually a brothel of some sort,”

“I was unable to walk at this point but the boys propped me up for a photo with the Chinese bird that ran the place,”

“I don’t know how, but the photo Brendo took made it look like we were in a restaurant. Maybe it was the plate she was holding… But I can tell you there wasn’t any food on that bad boy,”

“I have no fucking clue what we were doing there,”

When asked if he feels at all guilty about misleading his future-wife into thinking he spent the weekend drinking midstrength beer and playing sport, Nick says absolutely not.

“At least we had photos to show her, I know Brendo probably deleted about a hundred but it’s all about how you pull up. I was pretty much in bed by 10:30pm so I got a good sleep before breakfast with all her friends the next day,”

“It’s more of a case of her believing what she wants to believe. I mean, sure, I probably shouldn’t have been in a VIP strip club with my mates for eight hours, but I made a point of getting so fucked up that the birds working there wouldn’t go near me,”

“We had twelve blokes locked in for two days with no girlfriends or wives, do you honestly think we behaved ourselves?”

“Because she does [piggish laughter]”

The secret to losing weight is being poor

TEXT:

EATING LIKE A prisoner of war and walking everywhere is being heralded by doctors as the foolproof method to losing weight.

As this is a developed country, the overwhelming majority of Australians aren’t forced to hit the footpaths for hours at a time – and generally enjoy more dietary variety than two cups of Japanese rice a day.

Aside from the communists who use bike lanes, nearly everybody surveyed who uses their bodies to get to work each day said if they could, they’d drive or get the bus.

After being captivated by Indiana Jones as a young lad, 26-year-old Sam Gerrings said he’d follow his dream and study archeology when he left school. Rather than find himself searching high and low for priceless artifacts around the world, Gerrings is now living just above the poverty line in Sydney’s outer-inner western cringe.

“That chinless cunt George Lucas lied to me, then he thought he fuck Star Wars while he was at it,” said a visibly frustrated Gerrings. “If there was any shred of realism to those movies, it would’ve shown Harrison Ford bussing tables and having Amex cards thrown at him by people he ultimately wanted to be.”

We then bought Sam a full English breakfast, which improved his mood.

“What where you talking about again? Oh yeah. Nah it’s true. The easiest way to lose weight is quit your job and eat rice and drink instant coffee until your mind starts playing tricks on you. Fuck, man. One morning I actually considered going to church to look for God. Like him personally. I hadn’t eaten or slept for three days and I think it was getting in my head a bit. But after I put away a can of creamed corn for breakfast, I came to my senses.”

However, nearly every doctor we spoke to said that going on a similar diet to a bloke held captive in Changi is actually pretty dangerous.

Dietitian and faux-doctor, Dr Greg Poon says that the Australian POWs didn’t receive a proper nutritional diet during their stay in the camps. He also went onto agree that adopting an eating regime similar to what Mr Gerring outlined would result in weight loss, but it might also kill you.

“If you eat like that, you’re doing irreparable damage to your body and you’ll be the first to die among your friends,” said Poon.

“That being said, a lot of people say they’d die to be skinny. Runway models are like NFL blockers and professional wrestlers, except rather than die from anabolic steroid and protein abuse, models tend to do more blow than Jesus and eat like it’s Christmas in Dafur, which is just as fatal.”

Local Dad Agrees They Just Don’t Make Cricketers Like Jeff Thomson Anymore

TEXT:

Despite a comprehensive victory over the West Indies by an innings and 212 runs before tea on day three of the first Test in Hobart, local dad, John Pinnington says no current Australian cricketer is as talented, tough and as likeable as the 1970’s pace bowler Jeff Thomson.

“You lot wouldn’t know. When Lillee and Thommo were playing… It was a different game,” says the retired bricklayer.

“These little fairies wouldn’t know a real cricketer if he hit their chin at 166 kilometres per hour,”

With his sons visiting the family home over Christmas, Mr Pinnington has taken every opportunity possible to remind his children that Australian men are increasingly “soft”.

“It all started with Watson. Anyone who puts that much time into their hair isn’t taking their role seriously as an Australian cricketer,”

“Whatever happened to the mullet? Thommo knew a good haircut,”

As a former 2nd-grade cricketer from the Diamantina Shire, “Pinno” often goes as far as saying that even he would have been a better cricketer than the recently retired Australian captain, Michael Clarke.

“He was more caught up on his supermodel girlfriends and tattoos. Mate, in our day we would work 50 hour weeks and still leave the pub on Saturday night with straight tens,”

“I wouldn’t have looked twice at Lara Bingle in my day, she’s nothing compared your mother in her prime,”

“Thommo was a true cricketer, he made Rod Marsh’s fingers look like fucking twisties,”

“You blokes would never understand. The toughest bloke you’ve seen play is Mitchell Johnson… He’s a male nurse compared to Thommo,”

As Mr Pinnington’s rant continues to grow more aggressive and critical, his oldest son, Jeff, is forced to pull him into line and tell him to “give it a rest” – as his criticisms of Generation Y begin to borderline blatant homophobia.

“Homophobic!? I’m not fuckin’ homophobic. Back in my day the gays were ten times tougher than any of these little soft cocks running around in Armani suits,”

“Ian Roberts would smash that little Klemmer poof any day of the week,”

Trump Appoints Wrestling’s ‘Iron Sheik’ As A Key Middle East Policy Advisor

TEXT:

In the last few months, the world has watched in awe as a former real estate magnate, businessman, author and professional wrestling identity has risen to become the newest resident in the White House.

Donald Trump’s recent revelations regarding his proposed changes to US foreign policy, in particular, immigration, has shocked both Americans and the rest of the planet. He proclaimed earlier this year that should he win office, he’d effectively ban all Muslims from entering the United States, which was met with widespread and unabridged criticism.

Speaking today from Los Angeles, Trump said he learned “everything he needs to know about foreigners from his time in the World Wrestling Entertainment”.

“The Iron Sheik terrorised the WWE for over a decade,” said Trump. “That was one of the first documented cases of Islamic terrorism on American soil and the Reagan Administration did nothing about it. When he became the WWF World Heavyweight Champion in 1983, it was an attack on our way of life.”

“One of the greatest moments in our proud nation’s history was when Hulk Hogan leg-dropped that son-of-a-bitch back to Iran, winning the title back for America.”

However, Trump went on to proclaim that he believes the Iron Sheik could now be quite an asset to the United States.

“I do believe he has learnt his lesson and is now what I consider a proud American. I would love to appoint him as a foreign policy advisor”

“He knows how to deal with the Middle East!”

Muslims weren’t the only other alien culture the 69-year-old was exposed to during his formative years as a professional wrestler.

“Eddie Guerrero was a criminal. He’d lie, cheat or steal whenever I’d turn my back on him. From trying to steal my wallet to power bombing me when I wasn’t ready. Even when it wasn’t even in the script.” he said. “Don’t get me started on Rey Mysterio. He was the worst out of all of them. It became clear to me that Mexico wasn’t sending their best people to America.”

According to political commentators, making informed decisions on immigration based on the World Wrestling Entertainment is both completely insane but very, very clever.

Morgan Granger from the Columbia University Journalism Review said that Trump’s tactics of pandering to the lowest common denominator, or fans of both amateur and professional wrestling, is political genius.

“Trump was never going to win by taking his competitors on in a clean fight. Just like when he was wrestling,” said Granger. “By empowering America’s least informed and poorly educated majority, he’s all but secured himself as the emerging Republican candidate.”

Australian Youth At Risk Of Being Radicalised By Cool Older Cousins

TEXT:

A new report claims that Australian youth are vulnerable to radicalization by their cousin Brad. 

With the recent hysteria surrounding lone wolf attacks by gun-wielding extremists in France, Australia and Mali – both ASIO and other Government agencies have been scrambling to find a more efficient way to track and combat radicalization.

But with cousin Brad in town this just became a lot harder.

“It’s one thing keeping kids away from religious extremism and a warped since of martyrdom,” said Defence Minister Marise Payne, “but keeping them away from cool cousin Brad? It’s almost impossible.”

Experts have weighed in, stating that cousin Brad poses a far greater risk than ISIS when it comes to radicalization because he owns Tekken Tag on Playstation and will let you play it for hours.

“The problem with cousin Brad is that he can do a forward pivot nollie like it’s no big deal, and he has this sweet raptor claw tattoo that his girlfriend gave him with pen ink and a safety pin,” stated Clarence McTarrin, a international terrorism expert from the University of Chicago, 

“Brad’s reckless lifestyle stems from the recent divorce of his parents,”

“The fact that he is often left alone to pursue these dangerous activities undisciplined is not lost on researchers. What Australian parents need to realise is that his influence appeals to all kinds of teenagers, particularly young men,”

“He seems to be getting away with quite a bit at the moment and it seems both parents are aiding this difficult phase,”

Cousin Brad has also acquired a fake ID and is offering to let vulnerable Australian youths have a couple UDLs if they don’t tell their parents. 

Those who praise the concerning lifestyle of Cousin Brad can be easily identified by their dogmatic dress style, imitating the dangerous relative with their three-quarter WuTang denim shorts, FuBu basketball shirt, Echo visor, and Quicksilver chain necklace. 

With Brad apparently applying for a jet-ski license next week, our Government’s fears of radicalization will only increase.

Study Reveals Direct Link Between Cheez TV And Crystal Meth Addiction

TEXT:

A new study out of the University of Western Australia has revealed a link between use of the illicit substance ice and past viewership of morning children’s show, Cheez TV.

Researches have stated that ice users who reminisced fondly of the cartoon variety show were far more likely to become addicts, particularly if they began to recall the ‘cheeky’ antics of original hosts Jade Gatt and Ryan Lapin.

The research is just one of many trying to find meaning in he increasingly troubling rates of ice usage in Australian communities.

“It’s revealing when someone speaks of Ryan and Jade with such fondness. No doubt, they were funny guys, particularly when you were nine, but any 26 year old man who can bring up the fact Jayde’s fake reporter was named ‘Dick Wadd’ in conversation is showing serious signs of a troubled mind, and these are the people most at risk of drug addiction.”

Former 11 year old and current ice user Richard Hedd had this to say: “ye like remember when Ryan was makin fun of Rove like ‘ay im Rove n im ashit bloke ‘n’ fuck that was so funny, but then he’d like switch straight to talkin to the guy who voices Brock in Pokemon, fuck those guys could like do it all ay.”

Professor Krillin says it’s not just Cheez TV that can be viewed as as the precursor index for substance abuse. 

“We’ve found connections in the past between bucket-bong usage and [animated Australian children’s show] Little Elvis, not to mention a consistent ability to sing the Feral TV theme-song to conclusion amongst nangs users.”

Marty McFly Relieved To Learn That Being White Is Still A Massive Advantage

TEXT:

After not even 24-hours in this century, world-renowned time traveller Marty Mcfly says he is very relieved to learn that his white privilege is still very valid in 2015.

“I mean how about my luck!?” says the spritely Californian.

“I was really worried that I could have been met with some sort of racial prejudice when I climbed out of that DeLorean… You know, I could have been strangled to death by an overzealous cop”

“But I was glad to learn that being white in 2015 is just as much of an advantage as it was in 1985!”

“In fact, it’s not too different t0 1955 either. Other than the fact that my life expectancy has jumped up about 20 years!”

Citing the alarming rates of imprisonment for young African-American and Hispanic males, as well as America’s systemic racial tensions, McFly says that he is almost considering staying here.

“I mean it’s a great time to be alive, as a young white male,”

“You get all of the technological advancements, like GoPros Ipads… As well as the fact that you can still get a foot up simply by being white,”

“A lot has changed in this world… But white people are still way less likely to be living below the poverty line or in jail,”

Marty McFly says his day to day activities are much easier to complete by being a white man in 2015. He’s less likely to be pulled over by police, questioned by staff at shopping centres or overlooked in the corporate ladder.

However with such noticeable change in American demographics over the last 30 years, McFly is amazed that white men have managed to stay on top.

“Like, obviously we have a lot to compete with. Women are now being afforded very similar opportunities. Not to mention the rise in Indian and East Asian academics,”

“What I am confused about his how the Arabs became such a vilified minority… Last I heard they were helping us kick Russia’s ass in the Middle East…”

“What’s this shit I’m hearing about the World Trade Centre?”

Scientists establish link between diminished brain function and Hillsong Church

TEXT:

A LEADING research fellow at a prominent Sydney university has been able to establish a link between people with diminished brain capacity and the evangelical Hillsong Church. Professor Gabrielle Bouykisser from the University of New South Wales says that the study took place over a number of years and had nearly fifty active participants.

“We were able to test the brain function of a person before they join the church and after they’d joined,” she said. “What we discovered was very alarming.”

What Professor Bouykisser was able to discover was joining a religious order such as Hillsong is more harmful to brain health than smoking – a result which has replicated in other similar studies overseas. What is causing this slow brain death is now subject of another study.

Lashing out at the scientific research body, Hillsong pastor Greg Stove said that only He has the power to look into the minds of His children. It’s not the first time Stove has hit back at mainstream society. In 2009, he was arrested by police in Brisbane after he tried to shoot down a blimp displaying what he called anti-Christian messages. His lawyer argued that Stove was free, under the law of Jesus, to carry the .30-30 lever action rifle in public. He was sentenced to a suspended 17-year good behaviour bond.

“We welcome scientific studies like this one because it only makes Him more powerful,” said Stove. “Before I started coming to Hillsong, all I did was smoke heroin and do the crossword each day. Now I can’t go a day without tongue therapy, which is speaking in tongues. My doctor says I have epilepsy but he also has a gay son so his opinion is invalid – according to Him.”

Details of the UNSW research paper will be made available to the public on Monday the 21st.

National Carrier Pigeon Network Launched To Compete With NBN

TEXT:

A NATIONAL CARRIER PIDGEON network (NCPN) is planning to give the Abbott government’s National Broadband Network a run for its money. Using a team of nearly a thousand homing birds, the NCPN says it will provide a more reliable and cheaper communications service which will be available to Australians much sooner than the proposed fibre-to-node plan.

“At the moment, we plan to use the birds to carry a 64GB USB flash drive between us and our clients,” said NCPN programme director Clark Bellern. “Once the bird arrives back from the client, we will pop the USB in the mail and send it on to wherever it needs to go.”

This bold and drastic new plan comes after continued delays and setbacks associated with the current Turnbull-endorsed scheme, which has come under fire from every direction. Since winning power two years ago, the government has repeatedly ignored the advice of experts and digital architects – choosing only to listen to their accountants.

Clark Bellern launched his pigeon network today in a series of bold and daring stunts, which he says proves that his network will be far superior to the NBN.

“One of our launch partners, Beetlefield Radiology, gave us the task of sending a series of medical images from Sydney to Perth today,” he said. “I’m pleased to say that Derek, one of our fastest pigeons, picked up the USB loaded with the files and arrived back at our processing centre just moments ago. The USB is now on its way to Perth via registered post,”

“It’ll be there on Friday… maybe Monday. I dunno.”

The move toward homing pigeons comes at a time in Australian history where every day is a flashback Thursday. Just yesterday, the government breathed fresh air into its immigration policy by planning to implement a policy that was popular during the First World War – which incidentally was the golden age of the carrier pigeon.

However, the NCPN has been slapped with a legal challenge by the communications department, saying that the scheme doesn’t have the required licencing to begin operating as a communications entity. In response to the expected rise in pigeon air traffic, the department has entered into a de facto agreement with the defence force to shoot homing pigeons out of the skies.

“I can confirm that enforcement officers will be patrolling known pigeon routes,” said Captian Daniel Clock from Sydney’s Victoria Barracks. “If I or any of my team see a pigeon flying overhead with a USB tied to its feet, we will commence a surface-to-air engagement,”

The High Court challenge against the government is rumoured to have been bankrolled by commentating pigeon magnate Bill Lawry, who loves pigeons.

Pub Patron Dropping Owner’s Name For The 4th Time Expecting Special Treatment

TEXT:

Newcastle bartender, Mike Lillee has seen it all. From the pre-lock out violence that once rocked the Hunter, to the post-Newcastle Knights premiership benders.

But nothing winds him up more than the self-importance of drunk businessmen who feel that their networking skills extend into the front bar of the General Post Hotel, a venue that he manages.

“It’s the worst, mate. That whole ‘I’ve been working in Sydney all day, I could get you a job down there’ attitude is not welcome in Newy. Let alone this pub,”

In that same heritage-listed hotel, Mr Lillee is currently stroking the ego of a “well-connected” first time patron. A well-dressed alcoholic by the name of Peter.

“Do you know Nath Tinkler? Does he own this joint?” Peter asks Mike.

“Nah, mate” says the frustrated publican. Peter tries again.

“What about Singo? You know, John Singleton? Does he own this joint?” 

“Nah, mate”

Mike Lillee informs us that this game of trial and error name-dropping could easily last the next two hours. It’s only 5:30 but it seems Peter may have attended a long lunch before arriving here, alone.

This bizarre circumstance isn’t uncommon, Mike tells us. “These blokes aren’t usually able to turn off. They spend each working hour talking shit with clients and investors, then they pull into places like this one to unwind”

“The only person they have to talk to is me, the publican, and the only thing they have to talk to me about is their wealthy mates who might be my boss”

Back at the bar, Mike ends up giving in to Peter’s desperate pleas to dignify his presence.

“Does Clive Palmer own this pub? Or is Matty Johns? One of the Johns boys?” asks the Peter, the businessman from Manly.

“Clive Palmer owns it,” says Mike, lying through his teeth in an attempt to end the conversation.

“I thought so!” says the excited 45-year-old patron. “Clive’s a good mate of mine”

“Yeah, he’s a good bloke,” says Mike as he avoids eye-contact and begins cutting limes that will end up being thrown out.

“Make sure you tell him I was here,” says Peter, as he decides to orders another beer.

“I will, mate,” Mike continues to avoid eye contact.

Mike tells us just how he feels about this.

“Blokes like this really piss me off. I mean sure, I make a lot of cash off them… But I do get pretty offended by these kinds of questions,

“I have owned this pub since 1996 and for some reason they don’t think that that could possibly be the case. I’m probably the same age as this bloke,”

“And I can guarantee you this bloke will be here at 10pm, asking for a take away bottle of red wine after lock-out. He’ll tell me just how good of mates he is with Clive Palmer, and how it will be worth my while,”

Competitors say that the sunny ocean backdrop served as the perfect backdrop for group selfies.

“It was amazing,” said 30-year-old Sarah Greenman.

“The sky was so blue and the ocean looked great at the end of the run. It was really a good way to wrap up Dry July,”

“I was really happy that I was able to document my newfound healthy lifestyle for all my less inspiring friends at home.”

Social media is abuzz today with thousands of photographs of inner-city professionals using hashtags that imply the enormous marathon wasn’t really that exerting #City2Surf  #SmashedIt #IsThatAll #Finished #Easy

With just under five million dollars raised for charity, organisers say that once again the City2Surf has proven that exercise when combined with social media is the most successful fundraising mechanism of all.

Local Brawler Googles Bangkok Boot Camps After Six Sessions At Suburban MMA Gym

TEXT:

Ed Tuxworth’s days of 24-hour gym memberships are over.

“I’ll never go back” says the 29-year old mechanic, after finding himself involved in a nearby mixed-martial arts (MMA) club.

“No more waiting around for the bench press or the squat rack, nowadays I just do Muay Thai and Brazilian kickboxing classes,”

As someone who says he was never a ‘stand-out’ guy in high school, Ed finds the community of a MMA gym to be the best way for him to counter his crippling lack of emotional depth.

“These guys are great. We don’t have to talk about anything other than what we would do if we ever ended up in a physical confrontation,”

“Plus we get to learn how to kill someone with our bare hands, if we need to,”

Ed’s new skill-set has also done wonders to increase his confidence and aggression after four sessions in the “octagon”.

“I just know now, I’m not made of glass… ”

“I’m definitely Bangkok Ready’

“I spent my time learning how to fight people like a pro, and every now and then I get to test myself. I’ve gotten a few new tattoos as well… I really look the part”

Mr Tuxworth is currently facing charges for a “one-punch” assault on an innocent stranger in Mooloolaba over Easter. He says it’s bad luck that the victim wasn’t looking at him at the time, but he shouldn’t have brushed past him the way he did.

“I could get into a bit of trouble for this. I mean sure, I obviously blindsided him – but the problem is that nowadays I actually know how to punch people”

Ed says his increased aggression and likeliness of “coward-punching” a stranger all comes down to the fact that he is well-trained and confident enough in his abilities to fight people.

That, paired with his inability to endure social interactions without binge-drinking.

He also says that, because he isn’t likely to go professional, he needs somewhere to showcase his skills.

“I’m not doing all these hours for nothing. The fitness is great, but seriously, what’s the point if I don’t get the chance to overhand-right someone in the street”

“Some people are just asking for it. You can tell by looking at them.

‘Hope brought me to Sydney’: A Queensland defector tells his inspiring story

TEXT:

NATHAN DELANEY’S STORY begins with the 2010-11 Queensland floods, when he was 14 years old, which rendered much of the state unemployed and caused a massive humanitarian crisis.

By the time he was 15, he was homeless and alone, a starving orphan at a time and place when starving orphans tended not to make it.

“Hunger is humiliation, hunger is hopelessness,” he said in a moving TED Talk about how he ended up leaving Queensland and about the things he found on the outside, which turned out to be far more valuable than any Powderfinger record.

Soon after Nathan watched his father succumb to starvation, in 2013, his mother and older sister decided to sneak across the border into New South Wales. A number of ethnic Queenslanders fled to New South Wales for work and food during the floods; some came back, some stayed in Queensland and a number of them ended up in slavery-like conditions or dead. All Nathan knows is that he never saw them again.

“I didn’t even give her a hug when she left,” he recalls of his mother’s departure.

“It was the biggest mistake I have ever made in my life. But I didn’t know it was going to be a long goodbye.”

Like many starving young Queenslanders, Nathan devoted what little energy he had to scouring for food.

“My daily life became very hard but very simple,” he says.

“I used to comb through the bins near Lang Park for half-eaten Chiko rolls.”

For a while, he worked 16-hour days in a coal mine.

“When I couldn’t fall asleep, from the swampy ungodly heat or hunger pains, I hoped that the next morning Clive Palmer would either be dead or have decided to share his wealth with the rest of Queensland.”

In the mornings, he would will himself to make the decision to continue living.

Nathan did not arrive at the decision to flee to New South Wales easily. He knew that Queensland border guards would sometimes shoot escapees on sight and that New South Welsh border guards would ship him home, where he would likely be sentenced to a labor camp or worse for attempting to flee.

And he could have faced other awful fates in New South Wales, where Queenslanders are often forced into labor, forklift driving or scaffolding. But, fearing he would have to listen to Powderfinger forever if he stayed in his homeland, he sneaked into New South Wales at age 16.

Although life in New South Wales was harder even than it had been in Queensland, Nathan eventually found one of the “underground railroads” that aid refugees like him. They provided shelter, his first regular meals in more than a decade and, most importantly, help escaping to Sydney.

Queenslandese refugees often struggle in the outside world, for which they’re ill-prepared by years of propaganda and intense resource competition.

Nathan, though far from ready for Sydney high school after spending most of his school years scrounging for food, found shelter with his foster family.

He tells a story about dinner one night, about trying to reconcile his fortune in Sydney with his much harder past and that of his family.

His English is not perfect so I have cleaned it up in some places to help convey his meaning. His moving account conveys the lessons he learned about hope and love as a Queenslandese refugee, but that he says can, and should, apply to anyone:

“One day I came home and my foster mother had made chicken wings for dinner. My biological parents used to drive my siblings and I down to the Annerley Sizzler on Friday nights for the same thing.”

“They’d make us listen to some garbage like The Go-Betweens or the Bee Gees on the way. It was horrible but I’ve done worse things for a chicken wing.”

“That chicken wing changed my life. [Laughter] Hope is personal. Hope is something that no one can give to you. I thought I’d never escape the Queensland culture.”

“I haven’t seen a polo shirt with a breast pocket since I arrived in New South Wales. Nobody wears thongs down here, either. Queenslanders are fighting hard to survive. They have to force themselves to survive, fight hard to survive, but they cannot make it without help,”

“This is my message to you. Have hope for yourself but also help each other. Life can be hard for everyone, wherever you live. Don’t buy in to the Queensland way of life. In the same way, you may also change someone’s life with even the smallest act of love. A Chiko roll can satisfy your hunger, and having hope will bring you Chiko to keep alive. But I confidently believe that your act of love and caring can save another Nathan’s life and save thousands of other Nathans who still have hope to survive.”

Fred Nile also believes in these great Australian traditions

TEXT:

FRESH FROM HIS Thursday night appearance on Q&A, controversial Reverend Fred Nile has said he “emphatically believes in the great Australian traditions” while spruiking the dangers of allowing homosexuality to fester and grow in a modern Christian society.

The NSW state MP, a Christian Democrat, said a number of business owners in the US and the UK who objected to providing a service for same-sex couples had lost their livelihoods as a result of being taken to court for discrimination.

“This wouldn’t have happened if the Americans hadn’t abandoned their great traditions,” he said.

“The USA has a rich and vibrant history, just like Australia. It’s no coincidence that both of our once great nations began to rot once we stopped practicing life as the Bible dictates,”

“Sometimes I wonder – where would Australia be now if we all lived by His word?” he said.

The 80-year-old was promptly booed by the studio audience and faced a backlash on social media after making the controversial comments.

Australia has a string of great abandoned traditions such as our popular forced assimilation of Aboriginal people, generations of child slave labour in the agricultural industries, wholesome family-orientated segregation of public toilets and swimming pools and a genuine fear of ambition women.

Toward the end of last night’s programme, Nile was asked by an “extroverted lesbian” about his formative years, hoping that his response might give a rare insight in to the politician.

The father-of-four said he yearns for the family values he grew up with, saying that everybody was “happier back then”.

“Oh how I long for the time when everybody knew their place,” said Nile.

“We had no issues with gays because there weren’t any. We had no issues with immigrants because they were Christians and friendly. Women were happy because the men provided them with everything they needed in life,”

“Crime was low. Children were made in the missionary position and men wore ties each time they stepped outside.” he recalled.

It’s a far cry from the multi-cultural and crime riddled Australia the current generation have inherited from their parents.

Earlier this year, the Christian Democrats commissioned a report in to the state of the nation – saying they’d found some deeply disturbing trends beginning to emerge within Australian culture.

In March, Nile delivered a speech inside the walls of NSW Parliament which outlined the fact that straight-shooting Liberal voting Australian men have fraternised with homosexuals for decades.

It was also news to the right-leaning political alliance that lesbians are now allowed to be politicians, as well as mothers.

“These people talk about being tolerant, homosexuals say let’s be tolerant, except when they get the power, they exercise the power. I have a number of friends now before the anti-discrimatnion tribunal who are being persecuted by homosexuals in this state.”

“They are. Don’t laugh. They are,” he added.

He then went on to accuse the gay community of using the law to persecute those who felt it was against their religious beliefs to provide services.

“What worries me in some of the states in America where it has come in, and in the UK, the people who are now being persecuted are the Christians who don’t agree with same-sex marriage,” the Reverend told the audience.

“The success of my comedy has been not being afraid to touch on subject matters or issues that everyone else is politically scared of.”

Big Dicks Wanted – New doco shines light on exploited male porn stars

TEXT:

EACH YEAR THOUSANDS of young men pursue careers in professional amateur porn, chasing dreams of glamour, money, fame, self-empowerment, and great sex. But as the performers profiled in Big Dicks Wanted discover, the reality may be something else entirely.

Directed by Betoota local Brett Pearson produced by Sigmund Remienko, this intimate documentary premiered at the Betoota Film Festival in March. It was released on Stan on Saturday.

Nathan, a 19-year-old former high school cricket captain from Thargomindah, sees porn as an “easy escape” from the doldrums of his hometown. He connects with Harry, hid 23-year-old pro-am agent, on Gumtree, where he finds new talent by posting ads seeking models.

“Every day, a new big dick turns 18, and every day, a new bloke wants to do porn,” Harry says.

He flies his prospects out to Betoota, puts them up in his five-bedroom Queenslander (which is perpetually strewn with men’s clothing and hunting equipment), and coordinates their bookings. Harry’s so-called “big dicks,” marketed under the name Bulloo Models, are mostly between the ages of 18 and 21. At 25, Scott — who performs under Kevin Steelecock — has already been rebranded as a “dad dick”.

Off the clock, the women play with Harry’s puppy, joke, swap war stories, watch Slim Dusty videos, smoke rollies, and enjoy the occasional black rat. It’s not unlike a footy club, or an adult-themed version of The Footy Show.

But this business thrives on fresh meat. As veteran adult performer Ellis Starkwell puts it, a male porn star’s “shelf life” usually proves fleeting.

When the mainstream jobs inevitably dry up, these men turn to niche, fetish-oriented videos, which may be violent or of a nature that the performers find personally unsettling.

For example, Scott is the subject of the film’s most disturbing footage. He performs an act known as “Arabian Goggles” — a “seldom-seen” manoeuvre where Scott put his testicles over the eye sockets of the female actress while receiving fellatio — and withstands a slew of racist insults while filming a video for a series called Afghan Cumeleers. It’s hilarious to watch.

Forty-year-old Rupert’s (a.k.a. Rod Stiffhouse) discomfort is palpable on the set of Monster Cock IV, in which his character is seduced by a pushy girl-next-door type.

“As long as you have a huge dick, and a tight rig, and ass, that’s all the matters,” he observes. “They don’t care about who you actually are.”

Later, Rupert relates the frightening story of a shoot where he found himself unexpectedly requested to perform a Norwegian Steam Engine, in the back of his unregistered 1983 Volvo 204GL.

“I was scared. I was terrified,” he says. “I didn’t know what to do. I didn’t know if I could tell her no,”

Nathan’s step-cousin and greyhound beg him to quit porn, and after four months, he finally does. In that time, Nathan — who at one point developed chaffing on his large rod, the result of having too much sex — estimates that he made $25 000, but left the industry with just $200 in his bank account.

As seen in the doc, the big dicks perform in three to five scenes a week, earning an average of $800 for each, but that money disappears quickly. Expenses include beer, tobacco and sunscreen, STD testing, and their agent’s 10% fee.

Although they’re regularly screened for disease, the documentary’s subjects’ apparent ignorance about contraception is startling. Nathan tells his mother that he doesn’t use any form of birth control. 

Critics of Big Dicks Wanted have rightly pointed out that the filmmakers’ suggestion that sexualised images in the media (Kim Kardashian flashing her gash at the drop of a hat, for instance) have troublingly “desensitised” our society feels off-base, even old-fashioned. And as Dennis Lillee writes in the Queensland Country Life, Pearson and Remienko sometimes struggle to find the right balance between “respecting the right of their subjects to make the choices they do while abhorring those decisions.”

But the final product, while far from flawless, is nevertheless deeply affecting. It’s a harrowing portrait of an industry in which oversized penises are essentially disposable.

The Catch-22 that young Australian men face everyday

TEXT:

IT’S A CRITICAL decision made by thousands of Australian men preparing for a night out.

To wash the bed sheets or not?

A Catch-22 because in ever-increasing numbers, young men are venturing out into the evening – planning to “just have a couple with the boys” before being home in bed before MasterChef is over.

It’s the easy option because it involves the bare minimum amount of effort. Every man, woman and proactive teenager across the country knows that it’s a massive pain in the arse to wash your bed sheets – so they forego it and sleep in their own filth for another night.

Upon begrudgingly returning to the young man’s home, the mood is invariably killed by the giant off-white or in some cases, brown ghost-like stain down one side of the bed where the grub has been sleeping.

Darlinghurst waitress Annelease Elderford has been a self-confessed “loose unit” since leaving high school. She says that even for party girls like her, if a guy hasn’t washed his sheets in months, she’d be more inclined to receive the pipe on the couch.

“It’s like taking your clothes off and hopping into a giant dirty sock,” she said.

“Just please boys, wash your sheets. It’s not much to ask.”

However, in findings released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) today, the more effort and planning a 20-29-year-old male puts into pulling a root, the less likely he will succeed.

Traditionally, young men who plan for some pseudo-anonymous late night gland-to-gland combat are openly chastised and ridiculed by their mates for being a “try-hard poon” or a “desperate wanker”.

Faced by this Catch-22, south-central Surry Hills resident Bruno Crippler says that he always finds the time to wash his sheets because he enjoys not sleeping in his own dead skin.

“My mother told me long ago that the best cologne a young man can wear is a freshly laundered shirt,” said Mr Crippler.

“Call me crazy but the idea of going more than a few weeks without hot-washing bed linen makes me feel sick.”

Police Seek Man Of Christian Appearance Over Graffiti Attack On Local Mosque

TEXT:

Police are seeking to question a man over a graffiti attack on a French Quarter mosque last night.  

Described by witnesses as being of ‘Christian appearance’, police are appealing to the community for more information.

Police were called to the prayer centre on Rue de Gasson about 7 pm on Saturday after members of the Betoota Islamic community discovered the damage.

Police Superintendent, Sam Stewart, says that it’s only a matter of time before the perpetrators are brought to justice.

“A full investigation is underway,” says Stewart.

“It’s often hard to break the wall of silence in those communities but we’ve done it before and we’ll do it again,”

However, local Muslim leaders played down the attack, telling The Betoota Advocate he said he had no idea who had vandalised the mosque but that it was probably just some young Liberals.

“We are not concerned about this, the damage is only superficial and came off easily with a pressure cleaner,” the mosque said in a statement.

“We invite the purpetrators of this crime to visit us for dinner.”

Police in predominately Christian towns of Quilpie, Jundah and Yaraka have been put on high alert as the suspect remains at large.

This development is the latest in a disturbing trend of crime being committed by Australian Christians in inner-Betoota.

In 2013, a 27-year-old Atheist was gravely injured after he was punched outside an Old City District nightclub by a Presbyterian man.

According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, over 85% of the nation’s gaol population identify themselves as Christian.

Various community groups are calling for tighter restrictions on Christian businesses as well as a review of immigration policy.

Chairman of the Australia For Australians Foundation, Neville Hastie says that the government needs to stop Christian immigration altogether – before we’re ‘over run’ by the love of Jesus.

“Christians are failing to assimilate where ever they end up,” says Mr Hastie.

“The Christan experiment was a failure,”

“These people are coming into communities, where they’re immediately forming their own ghettos. They’re only interested in doing business with other Christians,” says Grossemann.

“It’s time to send them back to where they came from – and I can say that without being racist because you can’t be racist against a religeon.”

South Betoota Christian bookstore owner, John Parker-Jones, says it’s hard to fit in when everybody around you judges you by how you dress and what God you pray to.

“After I arrived from Ireland in 2009, it hasn’t gotten any easier for Christians to move to Australia,” says Mr Parker-Jones.

“The police would constantly hound me like I was some sort of criminal,”

“People would spit at me in the street. They’d make fun of my relaxed-fit polo shirts and call my jeans ‘dad jeans’ – it needs to stop,”

“I want to be an Australian.”

Police are urging anybody with information to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or by sending information online via crimestoppers.com.au; which people can do so anonymously. 

The public can call their local Police if they prefer.

In the case of an emergency dial triple zero 000.

Man dating vegan says he doesn’t miss his old life

TEXT:

A year ago, Tom Greenwood’s life seemed pretty normal. He had a good job as a stock and station agent in western NSW and was busy paying off his first mortgage.

That was before vegan preschool teacher, Emily, came in to his life.

“My life changed overnight,” he said.

“Meat, cheese, fish, eggs, milk and alcohol disappeared from the house the day Em moved in,”

“I’ve been working in the meat and livestock industry since birth and Em really opened my eyes to how dumb and cruel we humans really are,”

The 29-year-olds met at a live export protest in Sydney – where they stood in opposite trenches.

“I saw this pretty girl spitting on agriculture lobbyists outside Parliament House in Macquarie Street,” he said.

“Although I didn’t immediately find that attractive, I knew that I had to meet her,”

Emily agrees that their forbidden romance started at first sight.

“I saw this unkempt boy in riding boots and a sports coat,” said Emily.

“The way he looked me and the other protestors that day was so fucking hot,”

After exchanging numbers, their relationship accelerated quickly.

Emily moved into Tom’s three-bedroom home in South Dubbo late last year and the pair says they’re never looking back.

“Have you ever tried having a Milo with ice-cold water instead of milk? It’s just fantastic,” said Tom.

“I used to come home from work and have a VB with a cold meat sandwich – it was taking years off my life,”

“I’ve never felt better,”

Emily describes herself as being a “strict” vegan, to the point where she grows and cures her own tobacco.

“Aside from the ethical reasons, there’s so many chemicals and preservatives in an average diet that make it crazy,” said Emily.

“The same goes with mainstream tobacco. I grow my own so I know there’s no toxic chemicals in the smoke I inhale.”

It was another lifestyle change that Tom said has profoundly impacted upon his life.

“I was never a smoker but Em got me hooked,” he said.

“She said it was organic tobacco and could help my asthma.”

The couple isn’t sure what the future holds but Tom’s parents are determined that he’s just going through a phase.

“The kid grew up eating mutton,” said George Greenwood, Tom’s 68-year-old father, who’s been farming in the region for over 40 years.

“I can see it on his face. He looks terrible. I just hope he comes around before his organs start failing.” he said.

Tom’s mother Myrtle, says he’s worried about her son and thinks “Emily should go back to Glebe with her ‘damn’ carrots”.

“It’s insane. She’s supposed to be this healthy clean person but she smokes. She’s a walking contradiction. A hypocrite. She got my youngest boy smoking – after all his father and I did to make sure he never started,”

“I hope she finds another project and leaves Tom alone.”

John Howard’s Record Innings Dogged By Repeated Chucking Allegations

TEXT:

Former Prime Minister John Howard scored 191 not out against the Begum Rokeya University IX in Rangpur yesterday, after being accused of “chucking” in the first innings.

Mr Howard is captain of the Lyneham Cricket Club 5th grade team which is currently on a charity tour of Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.

The team, made up of other like-minded people who also loath progress, were set an improbable 403 for victory before Howard’s heroic captain’s knock, in which he faced only 90 balls, sealed the win.

The 78-year-old’s slogfest ranks among the most impressive limited-overs innings of all time – placing him in the top ten highest individual totals ever.

His stellar innings featured 27 boundaries and 11 sixes, which he achieved at a strike rate of 212.2.

“Their bowling attack was weaker than a threat from Mark Latham,” said Howard.

“And their fielding effort – as reliable as a Labor deputy prime minister,”

However, the first innings proved to be just as eventful.

Howard’s record knock was marred by a nasty on-field confrontation with umpires after the former politician was deemed to be using an illegal action.

At the end of the University innings, Howard finished with bowling figures of 0/182.

“They just weren’t coming out of the hand right,” said Howard.

“I was finding good areas but didn’t have any luck,”

A total of 19 wides and 48 no balls were bowled before umpire Mohammed Deez forbid Howard from bowling again.

In 2009, Howard was pulled from the bowling attack while playing a charity match for Canberra’s Red Hill IX after umpires declared that Howard was using an illegal action.

“There’s nothing wrong with my bowling action,” said Howard.

“I only ever get called for chucking in Sri Lanka and Bangladesh,”

“Some would call that ironic, but I call it bais.”

Australian bowling coach, Craig McDermott, says that Howard’s action is “questionable at best.”

“It’s just one of those things,” said McDermott.

“His off-breaks are OK, I guess. But the doosra is a blatant chuck, it’s actually takes the piss. It’s fucking near 45 degrees.”

The current incident has been referred to the ICC and Howard is set to undergo analysis at the Australian Institute of Sport in January.

“I’m going to clear my name once and for all.”

The Canberranese players are set to arrive in Sri Lanka tomorrow before the tour wraps up on New Years Day in Colombo.

Mature-Age Student Survives Lecture Without Asking A Single Question

TEXT:

A 46-YEAR-OLD undergraduate has reportedly sat through a two-hour lecture without raising his hand to ask a question.

The Bachelor of Arts student, Graeme Travett, attended the 11am anthropology class at the University of Queensland last month – only to find that the professor knew more than he did.

“It was quite a surprise,” said Mr Travett.

“The lecture was actually pretty insightful and I took down six pages of notes,”

“I thought I knew a lot about the first white contact with the Kamilaroi people,” he said.

“Turns out I didn’t,”

Mature-age students traditionally enjoy telling the rest of the class mundane, irrelevant stories about their families or children, with most arriving annoyingly early to lectures to secure a prime seat in the front row – while others even find it acceptable to bring their young children to the library.

That’s why fellow student, 19-year-old Rebekkah French says it was a relief not have a lecture constantly interrupted by a mature-age student.

“He showed great self-control,” said Ms French.

“We could see he really wanted to add his two cents but he stopped himself,”

“If only all older students could do that – or at least save their bullshit for postgrad.”

Mr Travett says he plans on asking fewer questions in the future.

“I’ve gotten a lot of praise for keeping my mouth shut during that lecture,” says Mr Travett.

“I might start drinking between classes like the other students do,”

Travett is due back in class for his penultimate year of study in March and says he’s looking forward to his future career.

“I can’t wait to be an anthropologist,” he said.

“Indiana Jones was really big for me when I was growing up and this is something I’ve always wanted to do.”

Local Mother Under The Illusion ‘Punching Cones’ Is A Skateboarding Term

TEXT:

Betoota Grove mother-of-three, Diane Williamson, says she couldn’t be happier about her oldest son found a new group of friends to go skateboarding with – providing they wear helmets.

“So many kids spend all their time inside nowadays, I’m just glad Charlie has found a group of friends that like getting outdoors. I feel like a hip mummy when I use their skateboarding lingo… ‘ripping cones’. 

“He loves going down to the skate park to rip cones with those boys.”

Diane feels the hobby of skateboarding is a great way for young boys to pick up life skills.

“Just the other day I found him cutting off a bit of the garden hose to help repair his skateboard… those things require a lot of maintenance, he has pretty much pinched every pair of scissors in the house!”

Charlie’s mother claims she has noticed a noticeably positive attitude change in her son as well.

“Every afternoon he comes home from skating, he always finds the time to curl up on the couch with his little brothers to watch their Spongebob cartoons. Ripping cones really tuckers him out,”

“I have no problem with skateboarding so long as they are wearing helmets, brain damage is my number one concern.”
