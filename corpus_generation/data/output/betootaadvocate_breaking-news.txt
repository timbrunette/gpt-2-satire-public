Shocking Sighting Of Third Crack Forces Qantas To Ground All Planes Immediately

TEXT:

After facing a barrage of calls over the last 12 hours to ground their fleet of 737’s, Qantas have finally caved. 

Following reports of cracks in a crucial part of the wing structure on two of their Boeing 737’s, the airline had been under extreme pressure to ground the planes. 

While they were standing strong against the requests by the public that they ground the fleet and carry out inspections and maintenance, the revelation of a third, shocking crack has finally brought the airline back down to earth. 

The image which emerged a short time ago details a sickening crack within a Qantas aircraft. 

“As you can probably gather, we are as shocked and appalled by the third crack, as the general public,” said Qantas CEO Alan Joyce. 

“We have made the decision to ground all of our planes to carry out the work needed to require they are up to the safety standards.” 

“As much as it kills me to take a loss in profits, it’s a decision we have to make so we don’t lose even more profits in down the track.”

Victorian Police Use Protestors As Practice For Mental Health Checks On Disability Pensioners

TEXT:

Victorian Police have arrested 12 people on the second day of climate protests at the IMARC internatinal mining conference at the Melbourne Convention Centre.

One protestor had both legs broken yesterday as the maligned southern police service ordered their mounted cops to charge into a volatile crowd of activists, in what has been described as a very Victorian Police way of de-escalating the situation.

Hundreds of activists from 11 different groups have today returned to block off the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre from about 6am to stop the three-day International Mining and Resources Conference (IMARC).

Violent clashes have been erupting between protesters and riot police outside the mining conference, where one demonstrator repeatedly spat on the oppressed billionaires arriving at the venue.

As things grow more and more hostile, the Victorian Police force have ordered their officers to treat the environmentalists the same way they would treat suburban disability pensioners.

“We’ve ordered our officers to just pretend these hippies are vulnerable, mentally-ill citizens whose doctors are worried about their welfare”

“It’ll make good practice for all future mental health call-outs”

This comes after half a dozen Victorian cops were caught on camera pinning down, striking and dousing a mentally ill Melbourne man with capsicum spray and a garden hose last year, after his psychologist feared for his mental health and asked for a police check up.

As of 30 June 2017, Victoria Police had over 18,440 sworn members, including 152 recruits in training, 2 reservists, 1,390 protective services officers and 3,367 civilian staff across 332 police stations. It had a running cost of approximately A$2.78bn.

Victoria Police enjoys a high level of community confidence among non-Sudanese, mentally well Victorians, and mining executives with more than 86.1% of Victorian residents feeling confident to contact the police. The general satisfaction is also high, with more than 76.9% of Victorian residents satisfied with policing services in general – unless of course they are mentally ill and have fear of being blinded by a lachrymatory agent while several failed AFL recruits drop knees in their spine.

As the protests continue to grow in numbers, it seems the Victorian Police may even need to call on back up from their African Teenagers Wearing Hoodies Taskforce, who haven’t been used since the last election campaign.

They’ve also taken the opportunity to once again remind Melbourne’s female population that it is irresponsible to walk outside.

Dairy Farmer Relieved Woolies Aren’t Wasting Profit On Trivial Shit Like Someone’s Livelihood

TEXT:

After fighting tooth and nail to get Woolies to charge 10 cents extra per litre of his milk produce, local dairy farmer Bob Kennedy (55) says the multinational supermarket chain has really won him back over.

“It’s good to know they aren’t wasting the margins they are making”

“I still think it’d be good to be paid fairly for my produce but I’m glad to learn today that they are re-investing wisely and not blowing money on pointless shit like the livelihoods of those at the bottom”

“I know from experience that Woolworth’s just simply can’t operate while also fairly paying everyone for their labour.”

The extortionate treatment of Australian dairy farmers under the Woolworths/Coles monopoly has been a hot topic of conversation in recent years, as the nation is forced to acknowledge that is doesn’t make sense for milk to cost $1 per litre.

In 2016, it was reported that Australia’s biggest collective of dairy farmers were having their livelihoods destroyed by a convoluted and deeply flawed public debt-for-equity instrument.

Woolworths and Coles fought hard to maintain their Morrison-esque model of trickle down economics, with some arguing they were ahead of their time.

Unfortunately, Woolworths was the first to cave to public pressure – declaring that they would now charge $1.10 per litre instead. Breaking the hearts of Liberal Party think-tanks around the country.

However, today Woolworth’s are back in the good books for Australia’s Hillsong Reaganist, following the news that they had created loopholes to underpay nearly 6000 employees over the past nine years – with repayments expecting to cost up to $300 million.

The supermarket giant said this morning the major irregularity was uncovered during a review triggered this year by the implementation of a new enterprise agreement with employees at all supermarkets and the smaller Metro stores.

Morrison has congratulated the retail-focused-but-very-pokie-machine-friendly-conglomerate for having a go.

Man Charged Under New Domestic Terrorism Laws After Eating Hummus With Fingers

TEXT:

The first arrest of the Morrison government’s new domestic terrorism laws was made in the early morning hours as an unidentified 23-year-old man was detained by police after it is alleged he dipped his finger into a communal serving of hummus.

A statement by the AFP outlined the details of the unhygienic act of domestic terrorism which took place during a social get together of friends where hummus once again stole the show from the other dips on the platter.

It is believed that during the social event, the host noted they had run out of crackers and other carbohydrate-based dipping vessels. Before they were able to retrieve more crackers from the kitchen, the alleged perpetrator had already struck.

“That’s OK,” witnesses report the 23-year-old said as he dipped his index finger into the hummus before licking it off.

“No problem for me.”

Those present state the perpetrator seemed to take joy in his actions and was remorseless as he continued to leave saliva flecked finger holes in what would have otherwise been a perfectly edible bit of hummus.

After the arrest, Federal Police searched the home of the domestic terror suspect, finding evidence of other acts of food contamination such as a jar of Vegemite with flecks of margarine in it, a room temperature chicken breast on the kitchen counter and a chopping board that forensic teams believe has been sitting in the sink for eight to nine months.

Details, such as the name of the suspect, are yet to be released, Prime Minister Scott Morrison says Australians can rest easy knowing that their dips are safe.

“How good is hummus?” stated Mr Morrison while looking directly at the only people of Middle Eastern appearance at the press gallery.

“Finger free hummus is even more how good!”

Local Woman Becomes First Person In History To Successfully Connect To Fon Wi-Fi

TEXT:

A young Betoota Ponds woman has achieved an incredible feat today. 

She has become the first person in the history of the internet age to connect to Fon Wi-Fi. 

“Not since man created the wheel has such a significant breakthrough occurred,” explained local Apple Genius Dillon James. 

The inspirational achievement occurred a short time ago when the dataless Arts Student was desperately searching for a Wi-Fi network. 

“I was just looking through the usual list of random Wi-Fi networks popping up that steal my data whenever I connect, and none were working,” she said. 

“So I just chanced my arm and gave Fon a go, and lo and behold it fucking joined.” 

The joining comes after 100’s of 1000’s of travellers and data bingers have tried and failed to join the elusive network. 

“I couldn’t believe my eyes when it worked,” she said. 

“Miracles really do happen I guess.”

“Maybe I won’t have to work a bar job for 6 + months before getting a job in the industry.”

“I just ripped my gum and top lip trying to open it with my teeth as well.” 

“What a fucking debacle.” 

“Why do they make these things so hard to open?” he asked. 

“I couldn’t be fucked asking someone at the food court to open it with a knife.” 

“Maybe I should just bite the bullet,” he said getting up and trudging off.

Nation Shocked A House Full Of Pissed Bogans Hasn’t Descended Into Run-It-Straight-Challenges

This revelation comes despite the fact that a group of 10+ blokes have been locked in the same house with a regular supply of piss for an extended period of time. 

That has left the nation shocked and confused, as to how a group of bogans with fuck all to do other than drink grog and do a few random challenges haven’t descended into a quagmire of run it straight challenges and so on. 

“Yeah, it’s an alarming revelation,” explained local entertainment expert James Moran. 

“I’m not quite sure how these blokes manage to behave themselves for the cameras.” 

“I mean look at that pool, fucckkkk (sic). That would be absolutely perfect to Tui Kamikamica someone into.” 

“That stuff would make for great TV too, so I think it’s something that producers should potentially drum up. Just let the boys rip in around the back yard and the pool and see what happens.”

QLD Premier Johanna Palaszczuk Sends In The Deen Brothers To Demolish Cloudland Overnight

TEXT:

Almost 37-years to the day since the destruction of Brisbane’s historic Cloudland Ballroom in Bowen Hills was orchestrated by the Sir Johannes Bjelke-Petersen government – last night QLD Premier Johanna Palaszczuk followed in her political mentor’s footsteps.

This time it was Cloudland the Nightclub, the iconic Fortitude Valley venue that was built in tribute to the aforementioned ballroom.

Palaszczuk has played dumb about the demolition, which was done illegally at 4am to avoid any interference from council or the Queensland heritage register.

However, she did make the mistake of hiring the same demolition firm that Sir Joh hired four decades ago, Queensland’s favourite wrecking ball contractors, the Deen Brothers – known for their chilling slogan ‘All we leave is memories’.

The Deen brothers confirmed their involvement this morning when questioned by reporters at one of Brisbane’s most expensive white shoe stores.

The infamous Deen Bros tore the Cloudland Ballroom down in a secret and brutal assault in the dead of the night, November 7, 1982, sparking outrage across Queensland because it was flat out illegal.

However, while Bjelke-Petersen was able to argue that he wanted to knock down the original Cloudland because his developer mates wanted to build some mediocre apartments in Bowen Hills – it is not yet known why Johanna so eagerly wanted to destroy the new one.

QLD Labor party insiders say it may have been a result of confusion, after Palaszczuk was informed that a group of underpaid Australian climate scientists were staying in the venue.

“Jesus” said one high-ranking Fortitude Valley policeman who asked to not be named.

“That’s pretty crook. It almost feels like she wanted to silence these people. I’m all for locking up protestors, but you can’t knock off scientists simply because they are delivering you facts that disrupt the activities of businesses bidding for contracts with the Adani Carmichael project, which has been identified as the nail in the coffin for the Great Barrier Reef, which represents 90% of all sealife in the world.”

“It’s like the time Sir Joh asked us to plant an underage boy in Chris Masters’ hotel room while he was up here working on the Four Corners exposè into his government’s well-documented bribing syndicate and association with organised crime figures”

Office Sandwich Press Hardest Working Employee

Hard work has not gone unrecognised at a Betoota Heights law firm where the kitchen sandwich press was presented the coveted Employee of the Month award. 

Although usually presented to the human employee who did the most unpaid overtime, the senior management team at Anton & Duc Legal decided the unwavering sandwich press in the office kitchen deserved company-wide recognition. 

General manager Tim Duc stated the office sandwich press not only worked longer days than anyone in the office but also had the greatest variety of jobs within the company. 

“At 6 am, he’s making toast and at 6 pm he’s heating up a frozen schnitzel,” stated Duc proudly as he presented the inanimate object with a Gloria Jeans voucher. 

“When we first picked him up there was a lot of room for improvement and now we’re very glad to have him on the team as a shining example of versatility and hard yakka.” 

Duc then went on to recount the various jobs the sandwich pressed has performed including frying sausages, melting fondue and once toasting almonds when the office manager accidentally ordered untoasted. 

“And all that without ever being cleaned. Not once.”

NRL Off-Season Officially Kicks Off With 300 Haymakers Outside Balinese Nightclub

After what seemed like an eternity, the NRL Off-Season is finally here. 

Following up from last year’s biggest-ever Off-Season, this year’s has finally kicked off – and in spectacular fashion. 

To mark the beginning of another year of scandals, it looks like a Melbourne Storm prop has got the ball rolling with a few hundred huge haymakers out the front of a Balinese night club. 

In an event that can only be described as quintessentially rugby league, video has emerged of the alleged Storm player in Bali going ballistic amongst a crowd while a small army of security guards try and subdue the big fella. 

Following an incredible year of appaling and not so appaling rugby league scandals last year, this year’s Off-Season has finally got underway after a few weeks of dead silence. 

The Melbourne Storm and the NRL have yet to comment on the video but it’s believed that the Integrity Unit are finally relieved to have something to get into.

Boss With House Full Of Teenage Girls Knows Way More About The Bachelorette Than He’s Letting On

54-year-old Steven Francis has today alerted some of his colleagues to the fact that he is far more clued into reality TV than he would ever admit.

The middle manager at a large faceless finance company in Betoota’s Old City District did so by weighing in on a conversation about the premiere of the program with some choice comments.

“Jesus Christ what was going on with the firefighter,” said the nonchalant father of 3 teenage girls about a situation that on the show last night that left a bloke in tears.

Receiving a couple of raised eyebrows from younger colleagues in the office who were gathered round in an impromptu debrief of the debut of Angie Kent – someone apparently famous from some other reality TV show.

“More drama on the Bachelorette than the Bachelor if you ask me,” said the avid 7mate viewer.

After dropping the sentence that probably could have given him an out from the conversation, Francis then weighed in again.

“The brother thing? What was going on there?” asked the man who might enjoy the Bachelorette a little bit more than he publicly proclaims around the office.

“Anyway, I’m sure I’ll hear about it at home,” said the dad pretending like he couldn’t just get up and do something else while the show was on.

Inner-City Leftie Vows To Join Rebellion After His 5000-Words On Why The Joker Is Problematic

TEXT:

As the Extinction Rebellion kicks into day-three in capital cities around Australia, the nation’s online purveyors of identity politics say that the cause is nearly mainstream enough for them to join in.

Wyatt Maile (32) is one of these heavyweights. His important work as culture website content creator see him hitting big numbers on Twitter in with searing reporting about fleeting social trends in rapidly-ageing Gen-Y lingo.

In fact, he has actually crowned himself as one of the first ‘journalists’ to steal the Engadine Maccas rumour from Twitter and put it into an article.

But when it comes to putting his boots on the ground, Wyatt’s brand of progressive politics kind of stops at his terrace house doorstep, the same place he grabs a $40 pad kee mao, five-nights a week from the subcontinental who ride mopeds across the city on $5 per hour.

Unless some sort of issue arises with a lack racial diversity amongst the guests speakers at these Rebellion protests, he’s not really gonna look at them any closer than he looked at the Jussie Smollett incident.

In fact, the last protest he went to was a rally against nightclub lock-outs, or something, back when ScoMo was still hoarding young families in Nauru as Immigration Minister.

When it comes to protesting against the acceleration of carbon emissions along Australia’s already fragile Eastern coastline, Wyatt leaves the activism to people who aren’t interesting in travelling to Burning Man next year and can afford the recorded convictions that would see them banned from travelling to North America under this current President.

So far, the Extinction Rebellion hasn’t even popped off in his WokeTwitter echo chamber, outside of a few commentators who accused the protests of being ableist for not knitting enough wheelchair-friendly bee costumes.

But as the environmentalists continue to put themselves on no-fly-lists and in the back of paddy wagons in the name of securing a future for humankind, Wyatt is starting to think their might be more expected of him as a leftie.

“Arghhh” he says to his colleagues.

“This is like, a big deal. Bigger than Keep Sydney Open, guys. Sorry. People.”

“I’ll see if the boss will let me head down there to cover it.”

“I’d fully join in but I used up all my long service leave at Dark Mofo”

Wyatt quickly scans his computer monitor for one of his 5-minutely Twitter notification endorphin hits, before realising he still hasn’t finished the task at hand.

“Actually. I’m gonna have to do a rain check. I’ve got to finish this op-ed on why The Joker humanises people with mental health issues that causes them do things that I don’t like” he says.

“I’m only like halfway through it. I need 5000-words, and then I’ve got another Chappelle hit-piece to churn out again before Friday”

“Fingers crossed they keep it up! I might go down on Saturday”

QLD Labor Pass Laws To Arrest Protestors, Like Sir Joh Did To Them, When They Were Lefties

Photo taken at UQ’s 4ZZZ protest by Michael Aird

The Queensland Labor Party have this week completed the full turn-around from a progressive movement opposed to dystopian lawmakers, to the card-carrying members of the loathed political classes they once protested against.

Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk held a press conference last night joined by members of the Queensland Police to announce that her Labor government are now fast-tracking laws aimed at incarcerated Extinction Rebellion protestors.

“Most people do the right thing,” she told The Courier Mail. “It’s just this group who need to be brought under control.” – referring to the environmentalists who are making it harder for her government to scorch the earth with foreign owned coal-mines that have been scientifically proven to poison the artesian basin and contribute to the rapid-bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef.

It has also been revealed that the Queensland government sought the input of the mining lobby on these new laws, introduced into state parliament, which designed to stop acts of civil disobedience by activists using locks or superglue or other dangerous devices, like their democratic rights, during protests.

“We’ve spoken to all necessary parties, including the newspapers and the mining companies, and we’ve decided, that in order to remain in power, we must begin jailing people who complain about us fucking the environment without a kiss” said the Premier.

In recent months, climate change activists have ramped up efforts to disrupt the coal-mining sector, including by blocking machinery and freight routes. There is a dedicated campaign to disrupt the activities of businesses bidding for contracts with the Adani Carmichael project, which has been identified as the nail in the coffin for the Great Barrier Reef, which represents 90% of all sealife in the world.

“These new laws should toughen them up. Labor organisers used to get arrested and sometimes even bashed by special branch cops. Back when we were lefties” 

When asked if she ever imagined herself becoming exactly what she has spent thirty years fighting against, the Premier said everyone grows up at some stage.

“These people aren’t protesting the same stuff we were. We were protesting our rights to wear trench coats and listen to 4ZZZ!”

“These people are protesting against our number one source of political donations”

“I don’t know much about science, but I know what’s gonna keep my in this job! Lock ’em up boys!”

Roosters Bolster Squad With Trbojevic Brothers, Munster, Papalli, Wighton And Ponga Signings

TEXT:

Concerns about a premiership hangover for the Sydney Roosters have all but been alleviated today. 

Some in the media had already begun raising doubts this week about the tri-colours ability to go back-to-back-to-back, citing roster pressures and player wage demands following another year of success. 

However, fans of the Bondi Boys can rest easy and savour the success that has been the 2019 Premiership with the club announcing a raft of big-name signings. 

The club has sensationally announced a multi-club raid including the signatures of Tom and Jake Trbojeivc, Jack Wighton, Josh Papalii, Cameron Munster and Kalyn Ponga. 

While Manly, Melbourne, Canberra and Newcastle have been left fuming by the raid, the Sydney club has already moved to assure Salary Cap auditors that the 2020 roster will be compliant. 

“Cooper Cronk is retiring, freeing up a million bucks for us to sign all these guys on great contracts,” explained talent recruitment manager Tom Parsford-Annesley, known around the club as TPA. 

“So we have been easily able to fit these guys into the cap for next year,” explained TPA refusing to answer any questions about what other things may have been thrown in to sweeten the deal of million dollar players apparently happy on low six-figure contracts. 

The moves have already seemed to cause selection headaches for coach Trent Robinson, who has hinted at playing Josh Papalii and Jake Trbojevic on the bench, and Tom Trbojevic and Cameron Munster in the centres. 

“Look it’s a great problem to have, and I’m thankful to the club for its smart roster management that allows us to do this without cheating the salary cap at all,” said Robinson before having a brief consultation with the Coach Whisperer and ending the conversation.

Impending Recession To Be Solved By Offering No Policies And Awkwardly Sucking Up To America

TEXT:

In good news for nervous Australians, it can be confirmed today that the impending recession shouldn’t be too much of an issue. 

This comes after the nation’s Treasurer Josh Frydenberg told The Advocate that everything’s going to be okay. 

“We have a bold and exciting new policy that should protect the nation from any of the negative effects of a sharp global downturn,” said Frydenberg. 

“The policy, believe it or not, is effectively to offer up no policies to combat the global market slide, worsening economy and ready to burst housing bubble, but just cosy up with Trump and the US and hope it all works out.” 

“So to anyone living just above the bread line, or hoping to live off their superannuation in a couple of years, don’t worry, our policy of just hoping the recession goes away will look after you.” 

Frydenberg then explained that if the policy doesn’t, in fact, work out, and the effects of a global recession hit home across the country, then you know who to blame. 

“Labor. Obviously.”

“We are trying to avoid a recession, but if it does in fact take hold, well it was obviously unavoidable because of Labor’s fiscal recklessness when they were last in office.”

NRL Provides Hazmat Decontamination Tent For The Dally Ms Anti-Vax Table

TEXT:

The NRL was on show last night as the stars of the rugby league, from players to coaches to partners hit the red carpet at the Dally M Medals at the Hordern Pavillion in Sydney.

The game’s biggest names dazzled on arrival – with the women showing off their designer dresses to the cameras, and the men doing their very best to not get drunk and ruin their careers.

In a refreshingly wholesome look for the NRL, some players brought their mothers as dates. Some players even brought their dads in a heartwarming showing of community as the game congratulates itself on the spectacular season that was – and quietly prepares for this weekend’s Grand Final show down between the Canberra Raiders and the Sydney Roosters.

Last night also confirmed the NRL as Australia’s most multicultural game, with an Italian boy winning the Dally M for the first time since Danny Buderus in 2004.

Polynesians, Lebanese, Queenslanders and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders were also heavily represented in the nominations throughout the evening – as the rugby league proudly showed off its successful grassroots initiatives to expand the game.

Another community that was also well accounted for on the red carpet was the growing number of anti-vaxxers in the NRL. The wives, girlfriends and the reluctant players who now subscribe to a movement based around the refusal to be vaccinated or to have one’s children vaccinated due to a skepticism of the overwhelming scientific consensus about the safety and efficiency of immunisations – were more than catered for last night.

Commendably, the NRL didn’t miss a beat when it came to cross-cultural sensitivities that surround the anti-vaxxer movement – even go so far as grouping them all together at the same table inside a hazmat decontamination tent – so as to ease the anxieties of other young mothers that attended last night’s event.

The special tent also had a pulley system that would lower the meals into the tents, which protected the waiters from contracting whooping cough or polio from the glamorous young alternative medical professionals.

NRL stars Frank Winterstein and Bryce Cartwright say that their partners felt honoured to have their beliefs acknowledged and respected in such a way.

Sydney Apartment Owners Advised To Keep A Few Acrow-Props In The Cupboard Just In Case

TEXT:

Acrow-prop sales in NSW have soared by 20% following recommendations from the SES that having a few of the popular support posts on hand could add vital minutes to any impending disaster caused by the shonky materials and under-engineering for which Sydney apartment buildings are quickly becoming famous. 

“Although the chances of your hastily-constructed vertical shanty town collapsing are technically less than 10%, it can’t hurt to keep a few acrow-props in a cupboard or spare room where they are ready to go at short notice.” said SES representative Harold Spiegle. 

“That way, if you suddenly notice a wall has a crack or is missing entirely, you can quickly deploy the acrow-props to give yourself a few extra minutes to get your family and a few keepsakes out the door before the entire structure is reduced to rubble. In fact, it might not be a bad idea to deploy a few pre-emptively.” 

Sydney apartment owners Terrance and Joan Anderson said they had a total of 30 acrow-props in critical load-bearing positions around their apartment, just to be cautious. 

“I had an engineer come in and show me the best place to put them to help prevent the whole shebang from ending up in the basement carpark, and I must say it does help me to sleep better at night.” explained Terry.

“At first Joan didn’t like the look of a forest of galvanised posts, but it looks a lot nicer now that we’ve painted them a nice neutral colour. We even made a feature of the ones on either side of the living area by painting them a contrasting cerulean blue colour, which is nice.” 

Joan agreed that the extra support had helped overcome her fear of suddenly being crushed to death by tonnes of substandard building materials. 

“I’m really happy that we decided to buy an apartment in Sydney. Yeah, really, really happy. Ecstatic.”

Bilingual Teenager With Scientific Understanding Of Atmospheric Physics Apparently An Idiot

TEXT:

An internationally recognised 16-year-old Swede who is fluent in several languages and responsible for a rapidly changing global consensus towards climatology, is an idiot, according to a lot of old people.

Despite spending a fair amount of time not at school, due to her role as an ambassador for the future of humankind, 99% of the world’s scientists believe Greta Thunberg has a better grasp of Atmospheric Physics than any of the world leaders that attended last week’s UN summit.

Atmospheric physics is a branch of meteorology and is related to studying the layers of the atmosphere, weather systems, and climatic phenomena. 

Atmospheric physicists are usually employed as faculty at universities or as research scientists at national labs, unless that particular institution is being urged by conservative governments and funding bodies to redirect their focus towards Western Civilisation studies, which is a newfound field of study aimed at celebrating what most atmospheric physicists are losing sleep over. 

One of the more alarming studies into atmospheric physics was the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C – which was published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on 8 October 2018, and subsequently ignored by anyone who had the power to do anything because of the cognitive dissonance that comes with being rich and powerful.

While business leaders and the global political classes are struggling to acknowledge very alarming findings related to carbon emissions and climatology in general, Greta Thunberg (16) has managed to communicate to the masses a relatively accessible summation of the global scientific community’s consensus on the man-made effects of climate change.

However, her recent speeches and rapidly echoing rhetoric has been dismissed by media and a lot of old white people, who say she is an idiot.

Her critics, mostly men whose own grandchildren have cut them off because of their inability to love anyone or anything after being left alone exposed to some form of sensationalist media likely linked to the Murdoch family, cite the teenager’s notable lack of sympathy and lenience for the fossil fuels and mining sector as a fine example of why she is stupid. 

Many then go on to point out that a lot of young people use iPhones as a counter-argument.

Greta Wins Over Australian Media By Yelling Racist Taunts While Wearing Collingwood Scarf

TEXT:

US President Donald has taken a subtle jab at Swedish student activist, Greta Thunberg, just hours after her deeply emotional address to world leaders at the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York.

Ms Thunberg gave a powerful speech on Monday at the summit in which she accused world leaders of ignoring climate change.

Tears streamed down the 16-year-old’s face as she chided them with the repeated phrase, “How dare you”, in an emotional appeal for action, which has since been ridiculed by conservative media as an example of a delusional little brat being triggered lol.

Mr Trump later shared a video of her speech on Twitter and appeared to join in on the pile on.

“She seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future. So Nice to see!” he wrote above a video of a visibly distressed Ms Thunberg.

But while Greta Thunberg is now viewed as the arch-nemesis to climate skeptic baby boomers around the world, she has had at least one win – winning over the conservative Murdoch newspapers in Australia.

The 16-year-old appears to have done her research into how to best garner the support of our nation’s media, and did her best to emulate the last teenage girl to make headlines in Australia for a controversial tirade that hurt a lot of peoples feelings.

By wearing a Collingwood scarf and yelling racist taunts at a Brownlow-winning AFL superstar, Greta Thunberg has immediately found herself completely shielded from criticism – as the Herald Sun and Australian talkback radio rushes to defend her.

“How dare Donald Trump publicly shame a teenage girl just trying to enjoy the UN summit. She didn’t know what she was saying” wrote conservative collumnist Andrew Bolt, in his most recent 200 word thought-bubble for the Herald Sun today.

Radio host Alan Jones has also come out in defence of Greta Thunberg, ever since he learnt about her very public act of bigotry.

“That is no way to treat a teenage girl” said Jones.

“Donald Trump needs to stop the aggressive handshakes. People don’t like it”

Crowds of Victorian and Western Australian bogans have also responded to the Donald Trump’s behaviour by vilifying him online, and booing every time he appears on the screen.

“DONALD TRUMP IS A FLOG!” wrote one irate social media user with a Fremantle Dockers filter on his Facebook display photo.

“Donald Trump is a sook. Toughen up prinsess” wrote another.

“(sic) disgrase full treating a teenage girl like that. He desurves to be booed”

Nation More Interested In How The Liberals Have Managed To Find 2 Women Under 80 Named Gladys

TEXT:

Between attempted leadership spills and an alleged Chinese spy in the midst, the two Gladys’ in the Liberal Party are in a bit of hot water. 

However, fortunately for them, the nation doesn’t give a shit about what they’re doing, they’re more interested in how the fuck the Liberal party managed to find and employ two women under the age of 80 named Gladys. 

It’s perplexing on a number of levels; firstly, that they’re named Gladys, but secondly because the Liberal Party, both federally and at a state level only have 24% of seats occupied by women, and it seems 5% of those seats belong to someone named Gladys. 

In a way it speaks volumes to the Liberal Party’s attempt at diversity. 

The name Gladys comes from the Welsh name Gwladus or Gwladys, which bears the meaning of royalty (princess); conversely, it has been speculated to originally be from the Latin diminutive “gladiolus,” meaning small sword, hence the gladiolus flowering plant. It may be used as a Welsh variant of Claudia, meaning lame.

The Advocate reached out to a number of young political commentators to get their opinion on Gladys(squared). 

“Every time I hear that name I feel like some is going to lather betadine on my grazed knee and make serve me up a hot scone” laughs Peter Petersby, a trusted source of The Advocate. 

While having two Gladys’ in the same party at the same time is a once in a lifetime event, this oddity shouldn’t overshadow the issues at play.

Murdoch Sends Staff To Wet ‘n’ Wild For The Day To Avoid Accidentally Covering Climate Strikes

TEXT:

Reporters for working for Australia’s biggest media monoply have today been treated to an afternoon at Wet ‘n’ Wild, as their bosses fight tooth and nail to avoid publishing any news about a particular news story that seems to go against their owners ideology.

That particular news story being the fact that millions of people, led by Swedish youth activist Greta Thunberg and students from Sydney to Delhi and Melbourne to London and New York, are today marching for urgent action on climate change, which appears to be something that the kids are fairly concerned about considering they’ll be the ones who have to live through the envrionmental catastrophes currently being caused by our sycophantic silver-haired elected officials and the other heavyweights of the western political classes, like mining lobbyists and the Murdoch family.

For the first time in NewsLimited history, every single employee on the Murdoch payroll has been gifted a staff day trip. 

This is an unfathomable job perk for Sky News and all News Corp reporters, who are spend most of their careers terrified of being sacked for getting pregnant or unionising.

With hundred of thousands of students protestors today rallying in every major centre around Australia, the jackboot journalists for Murdoch are today enjoying a day at Wet ‘n’ Wild!

“This is awesome!” said Kyle Chaddington (22), Daily Telegraph environmental reporter, who recently got promoted from CarSales.com.

“Mammoth Falls is crazy haha!”

Another journalist, Sky News field reporter, Kelly Cheryl (44) says it’s good to feel like you are valued, after spending 6 months relentlessly campaigning for a Morrison government.

Labor Says PM’s Dodgy Links To China Is Especially Worrying If No One Is Getting Paid

TEXT:

The Labor Party have today come out in criticism of the Morrison government for giving away favours and sensitive political information to a foreign government, without even making a buck

Opposition leader Anthony Albanese has grilled the Liberal Party for allowing a spy into the federal lower house without even getting an Aldi shopping bag dropped off.

This follows last week’s ABC report that revealed Chinese Government records indicating Liberal backbencher Gladys Liu was a member of two provincial chapters of the China Overseas Exchange Association between 2003 and 2015.

Having initially said she “cannot recall” being a member of either group, the recently-elected Member For Chisolm later confirmed she held an an honorary role with foreign agency in 2011, but no longer had any association with the organisation.

However, the ABC also revealed that ASIO had advised then prime minister Malcolm Turnbull not attend an event, based on the guest list, which Ms Liu had arranged in Melbourne.

Senator Cormann and Foreign Minister Marise Payne have repeatedly refused to use the term “fit and proper” but instead said they had “full confidence” in her remaining a MP – in turn, exposing how desperate they are to maintain the one-seat majority, considering Barnaby had to resign for getting a root on the road.

However, following a big fortnight of ICAC inquiries into the NSW Labor Party for their similarly dodgy links to governments that aren’t part of the Australian Commonwealth, Albanese has also stopped short of fully condemning the Liberals for bringing Gladys Liu into their inner-circle.

“I just hope someone is making a quid out of it gotdammit!” said Albo.

Man Who Spent Final Days Of Political Career Supporting A Convicted Rock Spider Finds Purpose

TEXT:

An unemployed Northern Beaches aristocrat who fell from the graces of the highest elected official in Australia – to losing the safest Liberal seat outside of Cronulla in the space of four years, has today found purpose.

After an early political career spent running coffees for John Howard, Tony Abbott was initially groomed for the role as the successive Liberal Prime Minister after defeating a maligned Kevin Rudd. He enjoyed this role for 18 months before being publicly humiliating by his arch-nemesis Malcolm Turnbull who confidently ousted him under the grounds of his fetishisation of scrapping welfare and knighting members of the English royal family.

He then spent the rest of his political career throwing peanuts from the backbench, before losing his seat by a landslide to Independent Zali Steggalls.

However, over the weekend, it seems the damaged goods of the Turnbull government has finally found something to occupy his time with between not getting phone calls from his daughters and being picked on by the much richer blokes at the Manly surf club.His new thing: telling women what they can do with their bodies.

On the weekend, Tony Abbott has told an anti-abortion rally of thousands of Christian incels in Sydney that the NSW government’s proposed bill to decriminalise abortion is “effectively infanticide on demand”.

Mr Abbott was scathing in response to the Berejiklian Government allowing the private member’s bill to come before the parliament, saying it was not what it was elected to do.

The fundamentalist Christian pro-life movement have welcomed Abbott with open arms, with stating that staunch Catholic’s makes an ideal ambassador, given his own experiences of not having an abortion.

When Abbott was 22 he had toyed with joining the priesthood, before realising he liked having sex outside of marriage. This resulted in great distress after his girlfriend at the time fell pregnant, and claimed he was the biological father. The couple did not marry and Abbott ended their relationship. For 27 years, he believed that he was the father of the child. In 2004, the man sought out Abbott, and it was publicly revealed he was an ABC sound recordist who worked in Parliament House, Canberra. The story was reported around the world, but DNA testing later revealed that Abbott was not the man’s father, meaning he had spent his life running from a child that wasn’t his. Which is much more respectable than having a pregnancy terminated because you aren’t prepared to raise one.

Friends of Tony say they are glad Tony has picked up this new anti-Abortion cause, considering how few Liberal Party events he gets invited to.

“It’s really good for him” says former Sydney University Young Liberal Party alumni, Wyatt Privolic (62), who was once in charge of patching holes Abbott left in plaster walls after arguments with female subordinates.

“He hasn’t had a cause to occupy himself with since he was on national TV defending his great mate Cardinal Pell who was convicted and charged on two counts of raping alter boys”

Bushfire Update: Emergency Services Set Up Safe Zone For Torching Over-Insured Motor Vehicles

TEXT:

As bushfire season heats up, firefighters are taking no chances to prevent the infernos of previous years, even though the initial signs point to this being the worst of all time. 

Which politicians are now reluctantly saying might have something to do with the climate changing or something.

The most recent precaution is the implementation of dedicated Car Torching Zones to allow motorists to safely cash in their insurance policies without inadvertently destroying a few small towns in the process. 

“Lots of people
have the liability of a car that is worth more as a charred husk so this is all
about providing a safe place where they can make a claim against their insurer
without endangering the property of others.” said RFS spokesman Leyland Sweeney. 

“For this reason, we will be providing these
discreet safe zones in industrial areas where the chances of the fire getting
out of control are very minimal, but the chances of getting an unreasonably
large amount of money for a clapped-out shitbox are quite high.”

Although some details are yet to be finalised, the
RFS has indicated the Car Torching Zones will operate 7 days a week, between
the hours of 11pm and 4am. At each location at least one firefighter will be on
hand to dispense an appropriate amount of accelerant and provide basic tools
for the removal of expensive wheels and stereo systems that “must have been
stolen” before the car was destroyed. 

In an e-mail, insurance underwriter IAG described the
idea as “fucking stupid”.

Barnaby Joyce Found To Be One Of Very Few Pro-Life Protestors To Not Struggle Getting A Root

TEXT:

Recently vocal pro-life campaigner former Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce appears to be the only anti-abortion advocate who likes to have sex for the pleasure it brings his private parts, according to a recent report by the normal citizens people walking past the Hyde Park protests on the weekend.

Joyce was joined by the CTE-riddle and now extremely unemployed former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, and thousands of mostly male Christians who can’t get a root to save themselves, and therefor resent women for it.

The weekend’s protests were followed by a wildly embarrassing 24-hours for the NSW government as rebel Liberal MPs angry at NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian over her support for a bill to decriminalise abortion have called off a leadership spill motion against her. 

The three MPs Tanya Davies, Lou Amato and Matthew Mason-Cox last night announced they would call an “empty chair” spill motion against the premier because amendments they wanted had been rejected in full “or in part with vague undertakings for further discussion”. 

The three MPs whose names have never seen the light of day outside of their own irrelevant hometowns during the state election that Berejiklian won for them, are believed to be only interested in having sexual intercourse for the purpose of procreation.

However, according to witnesses, the crowds protesting on the weekend seemed to share similar sentiments regarding the universally recognised practice of coitus –  principally the insertion and thrusting of the penis into the vagina for sexual pleasure.

Except most protestors looked like they haven’t even had the chance to practice copulation, even for the purpose of creating embryos that have more rights than the living and breathing children on illegal immigrants.

One onlooker, South-Sydney based car rental receptionist Alexandria Botany (33) said there was ‘a real school shooter energy’ around most of the fat virgins protesting womens rights to her own healthcare on the weekend.

“Lots of indoor cats in the park. Some of them looked like they hadn’t seen that much sunlight in a while”

Another witness, Western Sydney cab driver Ash Field (66) said he reckons most of those blokes would have pretty concerning internet search history.

“Lots of comic books characters on their t-shirts” he said.

“These blokes wouldn’t be able to pull a root in a brothel”

“I hope he’s OK. Hope they don’t put him through anything like they did in the film Spectre. As an audience member I mean, that film was boring as shit.”

Field hopes that if her friend has plunged deep into the world of international espionage that he is at least being as safe an unproblematic as he possibly can.

Chinese Liberal MP With Close Ties To Chinese Spy Agencies Might Be A Bit Suss, Says Racists

TEXT:

For the first time since Josh Frydenberg’s citizenship status was brought into question during the 2017 Australian parliamentary eligibility crisis, the Liberal Party has today put their foot down and said that racism is NOT okay.

This comes as the Member for Chisholm, Gladys Liu MP, faces accusations of light-hearted treason by people who don’t really like the idea of having a Chinese Communist Party sleeper cell infiltrating the ranks of the government. 

According to Scott Morrison, these people are also known as racists.

The Prime Minister has dubbed attacks on Liberal backbencher Gladys Liu as a “smear” campaign with a “grubby undertone”. 

Morrison says this kind of bigotry is abhorrent, and it’s something that the Liberal Government cannot condone – unless we are talking about Tamil girls in remote Queensland.

This follows the ABC’s revelations that ASIO had advised then-prime minister Malcolm Turnbull to not attend a meet and greet Ms Liu had arranged in Melbourne in 2018 – because they thought she was suss. Which Morrison says is just a result of ASIO’s grubby undertone of white supremacy.

The advice was given based on the guest list for the event.

That revelation came hours after Ms Liu confirmed she held membership of an organisation linked to China’s foreign interference operations, less than 24 hours after saying she could not recall being a part of it.

Labor’s foreign affairs spokeswoman, Penny Wong, has called on the Prime Minister to assure the Parliament Ms Liu was “fit and proper” to be an MP.

Morrison has responded to Penny Wong by saying that he finds it very disappointing to see her so openly discriminating against people of Chinese origin.

“What has Penny Wong got against Chinese-Australian women being elected into Parliament?” asked Morrison.

“I think people should reflect very carefully in the way they have sought to attack Gladys over this matter and the broader smear that I think is implied in that over more than 1 million [Chinese-Australians].”

Local Dad Carefully Rations Out Mint Slices Like Soviet Food Coupons

TEXT:

Local dad, Clive Gasnier (55) isn’t fucking around when it comes to his treasured mint slices.

That means, one is enough for you, and it’s none of ya business how many he has because he paid for them and no one even knew they were in the fridge until he brought them out.

That’s because he hides them away. Because he knows that his family will take the piss if they knew he had them stashed behind the week old pot of spag bol sauce.

In suburban Australian culture, a mint slice is a round chocolate biscuit topped with mint flavoured cream and coated in dark chocolate. It is also available in Mandarin, Tia Maria and Coconut flavours. Which are weird concepts and quite frankly sacrilegious.

Like most Australian men over the age of 50, Clive is 100% of the opinion that the greatest confectionary product of all-time in the mint slice biscuit – even more so then the mint slice baked goods.

While choccie bullets and and basically any other form of licorice also rating quite high on the dad list – Clive says it is undeniable that the mint slice is the superior hand-sized dessert, and believes it outperforms all rivals in both the chocolate category and biscuit category.

And that’s why his kids and wife are only getting one each.

Clive’s wife, Brenda, who is admittedly more of a Cherry Ripe type, urged him to stop being so precious, but Clive treats his strict Soviet-style ration distribution system as a matter of principle.

“No” he says.

“Like, the quantities of food seem accurate, the actual sales seem pretty close, and everything seems pretty much shipshape,” he said. 

“I mean obviously they have fibbed a little bit, as does everyone, but they aren’t completely pulling the piss so I’m pretty happy to give them a big old pat on the bat and tick the box saying they are all good to go.”

Vegan Protestors Step Up The Activism By Storming Pubs And Chaining Themselves To Buck Hunter

Vegan protestors have caused havoc around the country again this afternoon. 

Pubs across the nation are currently in crisis mode after a number of protestors chained themselves to their Buck Hunter machines. 

The activism immediately followed the announced that Labor would be supporting the government’s new agricultural protection bill – known colloquially as the ‘vegan terrorists’ bill. 

Buck Hunter, or Big Buck Hunter is an arcade game in pubs whereby blokes named Jayden and Shayne compete to drop large deer to score points. 

The nature of the game has today seen them, and the owners of the pubs they are in, come under fire. 

This latest round of protests and disruptions comes after protests earlier this year stall CBD traffic across the country and activists invaded a large number of farms. 

The grassroots activism has taken hold in the Diamantina Shire, with a protestor chained to one machine in the Betoota Heights Tavern this afternoon. 

Yelling at The Advocate this evening, Indigo Waterson-Smith, a Brunswick local studying at Betoota University, told us that she won’t rest until animal abuse in all its forms, stops. 

“What happens here, in this spot, it murder,” yelled the young lady. 

“And I’m not leaving until the pub promises to stop the slaughter of virtual deer.” 

She then began the next part of her rant but the overpowering smell of essential oils was too much and we had to head back to the other side of the pub. 

It’s believed nearly 100 other pubs across the country are currently managing a similar scenario.

Concerning Report Finds Australian Kids Now On Par With Irish Lollipop Ladies For Screen Time

TEXT:

A majority of Australian children are spending more than the recommended daily limit for screen time, that’s according to a new report by the Australian Institute of Family Studies.

At 4–5 years old, Australian children are averaging more than NBN-contractors per week-day. By 6-7 years old, this increases to more than mums-at-school-cricket per week-day and per weekend day. 

This means that a large majority of a child’s waking time is spent in front of a screen – with the historically dominant television fast becoming the lesser choice of visual entertainment, as smartphone ownership jumps to 75% amongst primary schoolers.

The study found that children who engage in physical activities that they enjoy will tend to also spend less time in front of screens. However, this is not viewed as a positive statistic if that sport is rugby league, given that most of those kids are likely to experience more cognitive delays through head knocks and binge drinking than would usually be experienced by anti-social phone usage.

However the most concerning statistics is the jump in screen time for 12-13-year-olds, who are currently on par with the Irish lollipop ladies outside construction zones.

Distinction Average Student Underplays Nerdy Home Life By Claiming She Definitely Failed Exam

A young university student named Ashley White who still lives at home with her parents and doesn’t work has made an interesting claim today. 

The student currently studying at Betoota Polytechnic today confided in a fellow classmate that she has ‘definitely just failed that exam.’ 

‘Like literally, failed it.’

These claims came after White emerged from the 90-minute Discerning Places And Movements In Legal History And Ethics exam, she took as part of her Arts/Law Degree. 

Speaking in the library, the solid Distinction student informed her friend preparing for an upcoming exam with her that she had completely ‘fucked that exam.’

“Fuck, like, I actually failed for sure, like I can’t believe how bad I went,” she sighed to her friend who has nearly full-time hours at a local clothing retailer and is potentially a chance of failing because she had two 21st’s on the weekend. 

“I guess that’s what happens when you do barely any study,” said White, who has never failed a subject in her 3 years of tertiary study. 

“Ugh, so annoying, oh well, I guess I’m doing that subject again.” 

After a few more uses of the words ‘literally’ and ‘definetely’ her friend Lucy Sims spoke to us about the recurring theme in White’s rants. 

“Look, I like Ash, and I get on with Ash, but she claims to have failed every single assignment and exam we’ve done together, and then lo and behold a distinction or high distinction magically appears,” began Sims. 

“It’s complete bullshit, and some vague attempt to pretend like she’s not a bid of a nerd obviously.” 

“But no one cares if she is, and no one cares if she passes, fails or gets a distinction apart from her and her parents, so it would be great if she could reel it in a bit.” 

Sims then told us she had to go and try and grab the half-price sandwiches from the uni cafe before they closed.

PornHub Reports Huge Spike In Searches For ‘Fluming’

According to The Advocate’s data analyst, while there has been a huge increase in the number of people searing for Flume, what’s emerged is actually a new term the internet has dubbed as ‘fluming’. 

It’s understood that traditional rimming still exists, but it’s considered Fluming if you give your partner a rim job in front of 50 or more people. 

The Advocate reached out to Australia’s favourite X rated site, PornHub, to see if they’d noticed any knock-on effects of the trend. 

“Yes, it’s unbelievable, usually ‘amateur POV cream pie’ is our top search in Betoota, but Fluming has just taken the city by storm” explains Dorothy Perkins, CMO at PornHub Australia. 

“They say patriotism is dead in Australia outside of places like Bendigo and Ipswich, but the way you’re all getting behind Flume makes me question that” 

“At this stage I’d say Flume is in the running for receiving an Order of Australia Medal.”

At the time of press it’s believed ‘Fluming’ had received over 1 million searches alone, our analysts are waiting on the results of the nation.

After finally calming down from a big week preparing herself to climb Uluru, before getting too scared to continue climbing Uluru, Pauline Hanson has today tuned into the wireless to hear about what else is going on in the world.

It didn’t take long before the One Nation leader was once again seething at the state of this once-great country.

“What have we come to?!” she says, in that squeaky-almost-crying-voice she’s now famous for.

“A hardworking man and his wife… Have risked everything to make their way to this country to avoid persecution and torture”

“To then have two beautiful little girls, both born in Australia, and take a good honest job at the abattoir…”

“Only to be detained because Peter Dutton doesn’t want to look soft on asylum seekers.”

“These people aren’t forming ghettos! These people are English-speaking migrants getting in there and having a dig! These are the people we want here”

Pauline Hanson says as someone who works hard to represent regional Australia, she is absolutely ropeable that a hardworking family, attempting to make the best of an ordinary situation and helping to stimulate our rural economies, is facing deportation at the hands of the Coalition Government.

“Imagine if they were rich Chinese high-rollers” she says.

“Or French Au pairs”

“Listen to his name. Billy Wheeler. He’s as Aussie as they come!”

Ms Hanson was then pulled aside by her cheif of staff James Ashby, who informed her that the family were actually Sri Lankan Tamils, and that she’s being confused by the name of the bush town that is fighting for them to stay.

The 49-year-old father-of-6-scattered-across-different-towns-in-central-Queensland is reportedly eyeing off the subtropical regional centre of Biloela, in the heart of the Banana Shire.

The unregistered One Nation voters has cited the sleepy country town’s low-profile as the main reason for his relocation, and the fact that it’s only a short four-hour-drive from the Maryborough Correctional Centre where his old man and three brothers are currently on holidays.

Logan, and the 3 kids he’s willing to take responsibility for, were spotted house-hunting in the region over the weekend. Ideally looking to score something with room for a few extra beds when his bikie mates come through town.

Locals say they aren’t too keen on this kind of riff raff moving into Biloela, especially given Logan’s track record of violating the Queensland’s Drugs Misuse Act of 1986 . 

Unfortunately they are ultimately unable to stop him from moving to their town because he was born on Australian soil, to two white people – and has yet to come to the attention of child services for the fact that his kids are sent to school with a 1.25l bottle of Coca-cola each day and maybe a bag of Doritos between them if dads had a win on the laptops.

Logan says his flat out refusal to seek employment comes from a deep-seated hatred of authority figures and the fact that he’s still on compo from when he did his back trying to rig up a trailer for his fuckwit boss when he was working at the Caboolture tip twenty years ago – but he’s still keen for a cashie here and there if you need a courier for something. No questions asked.

While his reputation appears to have followed him from the coast, locals are hoping Logan gets his act together and contributes to their small rural community in the same way other newcomers have in the past.

However, Logan says it sounds like this town is full of snobs who need to mind their own fucken business and stop judging him for shit he’s done in the passed and who gives a fuck if it was ANZAC Day that cunt was asking for it.

Tax-Payer Weighs Up Leaving Tamil Kids In Biloela Or Spending $10m On Plane Trips And Guards

TEXT:

As the Home Affairs Minister continues to pinball the traumatised young Tamil family from Biloela right around the country, the amount of money being spent by Peter Dutton’s in an attempt to look busy is only growing.

After keeping the family-of-four locked up since the birth of the youngest girl, the cost to the tax-payer is nearing $10 million, after taking into account the thousands of public servants involved in the countless failed attempts to send them back to Sri Lanka where they face severe persecution and potential death.

This 18-month process has seen the family dragged out of their weatherboard home in Biloela, separated from each-other, transferred to a Melbourne detention centre for an entire year, where the youngest of the two daughters’ teeth became rotten because of poor dental hygiene in the facility, before they were put on a plane home and sent back to Sri Lanka. A last minute court ruling then demanded the plane land in Darwin until further notice.

The two-year-old daughter received a last-minute reprieve on Friday when the Federal Court determined her case for asylum had not been properly heard by immigration officials. They were sent back to Melbourne that, and then Christmas Island in the dead of the night, so as to keep them away from the lawyers, medical professionals and advocates. A process that has been a fuckload more expensive then just leaving them in the bush and letting the old man keep working at the abattoir.

However, these figures are not even including the $180 million Scott Morrison spent re-opening Christmas Island Detention Centre to house the family of four.

Earlier, this year, the detention facility was Frankenstiened back to life at cost of around in an erratic and extremely costly knee-jerk by the PM amid fears the passing of a medivac bill would see sick and dying asylum seekers be transferred to the Australian mainland – a risk that really is worth the nearly a quarter of a billion tax payer dollars that was spent averting it.

At least it is getting some use by housing this likeable Tamil family of four that everyone wants to stay in Western Queensland. 

Our reporters hit the streets to figure out what the average Joe and Jane are thinking.

Local tax-payer and swing voter, Cheryleen Grogan (55, Dental Assistant, Betoota Heights) says she’s torn on this particular issue.

“Look, I know Western Queensland needs to be protected from hard working immigrant families that just want to spend their life sweeping floors in a meat works and raise their kids without the fear of being killed by insurgents”

“But I also understand that spending up to $200 million trying to resurrect the White Australia policy is also a bit excessive”

“I just hopes this issue can be resolved without the kids having life long damage because they’ve spent their entire childhood in an array of detention centres while awaiting on the terrifying prospect of being flown back to a country that has a long and storied track record of murdering people like them with the most violent forms of torture”

Google Maps Betrays Country Mum In Big Smoke Yet Again

TEXT:

Self proclaimed and country mum Marge Dunkley (56) found herself yet again at the mercy of her digital adversary in a car trip to a metropolitan area.

Confused as a fly in a beehive, Dunkley states that once again she has been betrayed by Google Maps as she visits an unfamiliar area filled with taxis. 

“It said to turn right on a no right turn,” stated Dunkely with an aggression usually reserved for her son.

“And, I had to go through so many tolls even though I selected no tolls!”

Dunkley’s son, Michael Dunkley, later confirmed there was no way his mother could have selected ‘no tolls’ as she understands how to use a smartphone about as well as she understands his interest in dance.

Lagardisms aside, Marge Dunkley claims Google Maps is designed for inconsiderate city drivers who see no harm in driving across double unbroken lines while you’re trying to reverse park.

“They’re all rushing with nowhere to go. Anyway I was two minutes late for my appointment.”

Dutton Sends Clear Message To Anyone Thinking Of Learning English And Assimilating In The Bush

TEXT:

Home Affairs Minister and failed Australian Prime Minister, Peter Dutton, has today made a point of flexing in his rapidly shrinking cabinet position, by chartering a lear jet to send a hard working migrant family 1,550 kilometres north-west of the mainland.

This comes as the lawyer for the distressed Tamil family from the Western Queensland town of Biloela, confirms they have been once again pinballed to another part of the country – where they will wait for four days to hear the verdit on their deportation from Australia.

This two year process has seen the family dragged out of their weatherboard home in Biloela, seperated from eachother, transferred to a Melbourne detention centre for eighteen months where the youngest of the two daughters’ teeth became rotten because of poor dental hygiene in the facility, before they were put on a plane home and sent back to Sri Lanka. A last minute court ruling then demanded the plane land in Melbourne until further notice.

The two-year-old daughter received a last-minute reprieve on Friday when the Federal Court determined her case for asylum had not been properly heard by immigration officials. They have since been sent back to Melbourne, and then Darwin overnight. A process that has been a fuckload more expensive then just leaving them in the bush and letting the old man keep working at the abattoir.

However, while the treatment of these people is cruel and not a very Christian look for our over-the-top Christian Prime Minister, his Liberal Party colleagues say it is a relief that the Christmas Island is finally getting some use.

The detention facility was Frankenstiened back to life at cost of around $180 million to the taxpayer amid fears the passing of a medivac bill would see sick and dying asylum seekers be transferred to the Australian mainland – a place they are not allowed to go.

Politics aside, however, Peter Dutton says people like Priya and Nadesalingam and their two daughters need to learn that unless they are young European women or Chinese high-rollers – they aren’t owed anything by Australia.

“This should send a stern message to anyone else who thinks they have the right to just learn our language, move to a struggling rural community and help contribute to their economy” said Dutton.

Motivational Workshop Host Gets Aroused Opening Fresh Packs Of Highlighters And Flip Charts

TEXT:

Employees were shocked today after the man running their motivational workshop developed an erection while tearing the plastic off a brand-new packet of highlighters. 

It’s believed the group gave the leader the benefit of the doubt and assumed it was his jeans, however after his erection grew while opening a fresh flip chart they began to worry.

“Holy shit!” said Simon to another employee attending the workshop.

“Check it out! That bloke has a stiffy!”

The observation spread around the room like wildfire, with nearly all of the workshop attendees now aware of the leader’s erection.

Unable to deal with the awkwardness, one kind woman carefully approached the man to inform him of the tent being pitched in his pants.

“Hi, ah, you’ve got a situation down there,” she said quietly.

According to witnesses the man then turned bright red and moved behind the lectern, re-emerging with a jumper tied loosely around his waist.

The Advocate reached out to the workshop leader for comment, but we are yet to hear back. 

According to his receptionist, he has taken the rest of the day off.

Girlfriend Really Backs Her Newest Candle Purchase

TEXT:

Despite having over 20 unused scented candles sitting around her apartment, Candice Border is standing by her most recent purchase – a $92 scented candle from Jo Malone, London’s so-called home of candles.

The Advocate managed to have ears on the situation as it unfolded, and by the sounds of things, Candice is more suited to a career as a second-hand car saleswoman than a nurse.

“No babe, this is a Jo Malone,” she said to her boyfriend. 

“We don’t have any of these”

“This is tomato plant flavour, it’s so fresh”

Her boyfriend, Jeff, was less than convinced.

“Candi, firstly, it smells like a weed”

“And secondly, why the fuck do we need another candle?”

“How can you justify this to yourself?” Jeff questioned, genuinely wondering how the hell his girlfriend convinced herself that she needed another candle.

“Didn’t you tell me that you hated all the scented candles we have at the moment?” she asked, knowing full well the answer was yes.

“I bought this for you, I thought you’d be happy that I thought of you” she said. 

“That’s fine though, I’ll just go back to buying those spicy vanilla ones you hate” she said check-mating him. 

“Sorry, you’re right. This new candle is better, I should have been grateful that you bought a candle to make our apartment smell better,” he said.

Shorten Briefly Takes Off Face Mask To Also Dismiss Accusations Of Chinese Influence Over ALP

TEXT:

Former leader of the Labor Party, Bill Shorten MP, has today shown how dedicated he is to denying accusations that the ALP is beholden to the favours requested by Chinese billionaire donors.

Shorten even went as far as taking off his face mask to address the media- even while using public transport.

This is a huge statement by the former Leader – who has recently become fond of wearing surgical face masks to protect his respiratory tract from pollution and infection, and to prevent the spread of any pathogens he might be carrying.

Shorten’s comments follows revelations that the Chinese developer behind the multi-billion-dollar Gold Coast Jewel and One Circular Quay projects, Huang Xiangmo, handed over $100,000 in cash to former NSW Labor party boss Jamie Clements during a private meeting at his office, a corruption inquiry has heard.

Shorten, or Beijing Billy as he is known in the alleyways of Haymarket, has dismissed all claims that his party is basically a wishing well for Chinese dollars.

“Hold up a sec” said Shorten, while taking off his mask.

“Lets make this quick”

“There are no Federal Labor politicians that are, in my opinion, getting too close with the Chinese.”

“I can’t say much for those former Senators and MPs that resigned from politics to work for Crown Casino… Obviously they are… But as it stands, no one in the ALP is at risk of going full Dastyari”

“As for New South Wales Labor… Well. You know what they are like. I thought most of them were in prison by now”

The NSW anti-corruption watchdog – The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) conducted its first public hearing of a six-week-long inquiry into allegations concerning political donations yesterday.

ICAC will investigate if the state Labor party bent donation rules and laundered up to $100,000 in suss donations during a secret 2015 Labor Party fundraiser in Sydney’s Chinatown.

Bill Shorten and former state leader Luke Foley were there, along with federal shadow treasurer Chris Bowen.

NSW Labor has “quarantined” the $100,000 until the investigation is complete – however Federal Labor says they have nothing to worry about and that Anthony Albanese’s newfound love of bubble tea is something he picked in Marrickville.

Local Hipster Student Levels Up With New Anti-Tarantino Rant

TEXT:

If you think Tarantino is a good director, then you’re an uneducated fuckhead, according to Bethany Montgomery – a self-proclaimed movie expert who’s just gone into beast mode while trying to explain to her colleague why Tarantino sucks. 

“There’s just nothing cerebral about any of his movies” 

“No decent plots, no twists, they’re just b-grade scripts with some classic film techniques!” said the twenty-something philosophy major. 

“Look, Pulp Fiction was OK. But everything since then has just been so bland and empty” Bethany ranted to her colleague who was looking over Bethany’s shoulder for a reason to leave the conversation. 

It’s believed the catalyst for Bethany’s rant was being left out of a group excursion to see Tarantino’s latest movie ‘Once Upon A Time In Hollywood’, which has already earned about 80 million USD at the box office. 

Quentin Tarantino is a multi-award-winning writer and director whose films are often characterised by nonlinear storylines, satirical subject matter, an aestheticisation of violence, extended dialogue scenes and references to popular culture.

These awards and acclaim are seemingly not enough to impress Bethany, her rant getting heated enough for her to start sweating. 

All this while Bethany’s colleague has been stunned into stillness by the anti-Tarantino-tirade.

Local Woman Ordering English Breakfast Waits Patiently To Be Asked Why She Doesn’t Drink Coffee

With leathery and floral hints, and only half the caffeine of a cup of coffee, ordering a cup of tea instead of a coffee before 11 am is just begging for attention. 

Attention that Beatrice Swansea has been silently waiting for with her cup of English Breakfast tea for just over ten minutes now. 

With the strength of a Buddhist monk, Bea is patiently waiting for someone to ask her why she’s not drinking coffee. 

The twenty-seven-year-old health retreat manager makes a point of ordering tea in the morning as she believes that’s when she’ll garner the most attention and increase the likelihood of talking about herself. 

It’s believed Beatrice hasn’t always opted for coffee’s weaker cousin, in her younger wilder years Bea would drink upwards of 5 cups of coffee a day. 

According to her friends she only swapped to tea to be different. 

“When we lived together she didn’t even like tea” revealed a friend who wished to remain anonymous. 

“She used to say people who drink tea are weak, now look at her!” 

At the time of press, no one had asked Beatrice why she’s not drinking coffee, however there have been a number of quizzical scowls cast in her direction so it’s only a matter of time.

Tissue Thrown Onto Sydney Train Track Derails Entire Public Transport System

Things have gone from bad to worse for Sydney commuters today. 

In an unfortunate series of events that epitomise why Sydney is the worst city in the country, a stray tissue has derailed the entire public transport system this evening. 

It’s believed the used tissue was discarded earlier today, and due to the strong August winds found it’s way onto a track just outside Central, causing the whole system to shut down. 

The backing up of carriages to Redfern in the south and over the Harbour Bridge in the north, has had a flow-on effect, stalling the citie’s buses, ferries and light rail today. 

Following this mornings chaos, the latest delay has angered many in the Developers Republic of Sydney, plenty of whom are sitting in idle carriages as this point in time. 

The boss of Sydney Transport has yet to comment on the latest bed shit but the state’s Premier Gladys Berejiklian has issued a statement on the debacle. 

“Obviously it’s frustrating, and we are sorry about the inconvenience,” she said. 

“But we are only a few more of these away from being able to convince the public, that the transport system would be better off in private hands,” she said. 

“So bare with us please.”

Of a usual evening they manage to time dinner well. around 7pm on the dot when she’s home. So that he can be in bed by like 10 at the latest.

It’s a job that requires a bit of socialising and Craig very rarely gets a bait to any of his wife’s work events, mostly because he’s already home and on the couch by the time she knocks off, and is up on the tools hours before her she wakes.

But he doesn’t care about missing out on a free passionfruit-tasting craft beer and some lukewarm canapès – because it means he gets to try his hand at one of his very own 15 minute meals.

Tonight, it’s sliced white woolies bread, spreadable woolies butter, eight homebrand beef sausages and an onion. Plus 24 coronas.

“The missus and I don’t see eye to eye on what makes a delicious meal” says Craig.

“So when she’s out, I tend to give the quinoa a miss. Tonight I’m trying out this thing called ‘high carb’ – its not bad from what I’ve heard haha”

“And that’s not including just the slab of ronas”

Dutton Vows To Protect Australia By Deporting Rural Abattoir Worker And His Well-Liked Family

TEXT:

One of the few young families keen to relocate to a drought and flood stricken meatworks town out the back of Gladstone are today facing imminent deportation for being brown, to Sri Lanka, where they face persecution as failed asylum seekers.

The Western Queensland town of Biloela, that is already struggling to get young people to live and work there, is now one family less, after Border Force kicked in the front door of a family of Sri Lankan asylum seekers who’s visa had expired by 24 hours.

Nadesalingam and Priya, and their children aged 4 and 2, have lived in Biloela for several years. That was until Australian Border Force officers, police and Serco guards raided their home at dawn last year, taking the husband and wife and their two Australia-born children into custody.

Biloela townsfolks say Priya and Nadesalingam, and their two Australian-born daughters, are welcome additions to their central Queensland town, which like most of regional Australian centres, is struggling to appeal to young families.

However, today government officials have blocked an application for an assessment of the dangers the youngest Tharunicaa may face if she is sent to Sri Lanka.

Some considered this application the family’s last hope of remaining in Australia. Where they have lived as well-liked contributors to the bush town of Biloela – with the old man working in the abattoir and the two young girls attending daycare in town.

Both daughters have made the news recently, after it was revealed that Tharunicaa was denied birthday cake when she turned two, her sister has also been denied dental surgery for rotten teeth that have come about from their grim and under-resourced childhoods spent in detention.

Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton says sorry but, if he lets these people stay, then he’ll set the wrong precedent.

“It’s not like they are Chinese high-rollers flying into the Crown” said Dutton.

“Or French babysitters for Liberal Party donors”

“These people are working class migrants. Big difference. They don’t even have lobbyists”

Barnaby Joyce was approached for comment, but said he was too busy marching around Sydney with the God-botherers complaining about unformed embryos to worry about the livelihoods of two little brown girls from the bush.

Local Apprentice Pretty Low On Energy For Someone Who Drinks Two 500ML Cans Of V Before Smoko

TEXT:

Local construction worker, Kyler Tripp (22), has marvelled his boss and coworkers today with his apparent immunity to the effects that excessive caffeine can have on the body.

The part-time Aussie hip hop bedroom rapper, full-time carpentry apprentice appears to be unable to power through past midday without looking like he needs to have a nap.

Even with two full 500 millilitre cans of V energy drink swishing around inside him, Kyler just flat seems to run out of steam after a couple hours on the broom.

The fact that he doesn’t even seem to be hungover is also just as puzzling, considering every other bloke he is working with is, every day.

While Kyler is still at that age where he thinks coffee ‘tastes like shit’ – he’s still running on roughly 500% more guava and caffiene than anyone else on site – except for maybe the Damien, the ice junkie landscaper.

It is not yet known what is causing Kyler to be so lethargic. It could be the fact that he probably has contracted glandular fever from pashing random chicks in night clubs every Thursday, Friday and Saturday night for three years.

Or it could be the fact that he doesn’t get to sleep until 2am every night due to his obsessive bingeing of Joe Rogan podcasts.

However, what is known is that he’s fucken shithouse at hanging doors anytime after the smoko van arrives with his deep-fried kabana stick and deep-fried pork ribs, every day.

At time of press, Kyler was seen treating himself to the smooth texture of a 1.5 litre carton of iced coffee. A possible explanation for the fact that he hasn’t taken a solid shit since Schoolies Week.

Albo Accused Of Selling Out His Own People As Labor Backs New Law Limiting Cash Sales To $10k

TEXT:

Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese has today been labelled a sell-out to his own kind. And no we aren’t talking about Labor left faction, or the environmentalists, or the Grayndler residents who have had their houses and businesses seized for the Westconnex project, or the Australian working class in general.

It’s the Italian-Australian community this time, as well as the many other ethnic community groups that Albo grew up alongside.

This comes as the Government’s Black Economy Taskforce argues a $10,000 cash limit for transactions between businesses and individuals would help fight the cash economy by tackling tax evasion, money laundering and the privacy of law-abiding Southern-European seniors.

The proposed laws tabled under the Currency (Restrictions on the Use of Cash) Bill would see Australians face two-year jail sentences and up to $25,200 in fines if cash transactions between business and individuals exceed $10,000.

So far, Bob Katter MP is the only politician who has slammed the Bill labelling it a “danger to our freedom greater than the danger through terrorism”.

Katter, who has a lot of old Greeks and Italians in the North Queensland end of his electorate, has likened the Bill to George Orwell’s novel 1984, saying the law violates a person’s right to privacy. 

However, Shadow Assistant Treasurer Stephen Jones said Labor would look at the details of the legislation but the bar for the party to vote against the proposed law was “very, very high” – with Albo remaining tight-lipped on the issue.

The ALP leader was notably absent from the Ferragosto Italian Festival in his home electorate over the weekend, with many of the local Nonnos speculating he wouldn’t be game to show his face around Five Dock.

“He a sell us out mayte” said local fruiterer, Santino Carbone (75).

“I a carry $20k in the boot of my Charger at all times. In case I see another Charger I wanta to buy”

Sky News Really Hoping For A Couple Sudanese Teenagers To Punch-On In Melbourne Today

TEXT:

Conservative Murdoch news publishers around the country are today doing their best to not acknowledge the fact that they have spent 6 months openly defending a convicted pedophile, in major newspapers and television panel shows.

This follows the breaking news out of Melbourne this morning that Australia’s most notorious rock spider will likely die in prison, despite the hard efforts of John Howard, Tony Abbott and Murdoch mouthpiece Andrew Bolt.

Cardinal George Pell, the former 3rd highest-ranking official in the Catholic Church had his appeal for child sex crimes quashed this morning.

The low dog rock spider lost his appeal against his convictions over sexual offences against two choir boys in Melbourne in the 1990’s.

However, this news comes as an inconvenience to the conservative narrative that the most dangerous people walking our streets are in fact not priests, but black kids who wear hoodies.

Sky News and Herald Sun reporters have been urged by the lizards that work above them to avoid the Pell case altogether, and instead go down to Sunshine and watch South Sudanese teenagers playing basketball – in a hope a fight might break out.

Muslims are also expected to be use a race-bait in today’s news cycle, as the deeply conservative media networks do their best to pretend that the highest-ranking Catholic figure in Australian history didn’t just get sent to prison for the rest of his life for raping kids.

If neither are possible, reporters have been told to go look for people with modified street cars, or shopping centres with too many signs in Chinese.

Anti-Abortion Protestors Worry New Bill Will Limit Amount Of Kids Their Priests Have Access To

TEXT:

Anti-abortion protestors in harbourside city of Sydney are re-focusing this morning, after being disappointed by the decision of the Victorian Court of Appeal down in Melbourne. 

The upholding of the conviction of the rock spider George Pell today, follows thousands taking to the CBD in Sydney last night to protest against the decriminalisation of abortion. 

Holding placards and chanting, the pro-lifers took to the streets in a desperate attempt to stop the NSW government passing the abortion bill that has been endorsed by most sitting politicians, doctors, women’s health experts, lawyers, and domestic violence experts. 

Speaking to The Advocate out the front of the NSW State Parliament this morning, a spokesperson for the pro-lifers explained that there is so much at stake with the legalising of a medical procedure. 

“The passing of this bill will further widen the gap between church and state, and we don’t want to live in a world where our church doesn’t have influence over our law-making bodies,” the spokesperson named Phil Shillton said. 

“And even scarier than women having control over their own bodies is the fact that the priests in our Church, and people in our institutions will have limited to access to children.” 

“Given the Church’s long and storied history of child abuse, removing the ability of our priests to do that would almost be like pulling a pillar out from our foundations.” 

Shillton then explained allowing women safe access to abortions, would have a certain detriment on the Church’s ability to do that. 

“Forcing women to have unwanted children, which can end up in our institutions and homes has been a core business model for us, so we need to fight to stop this bill from happening.” 

“Anyway, I’ve got to get back to it,” said the man not taking the hint that he should maybe fuck up about lecturing people on morals for a little bit.

BREAKING: Dirty Old Pedo To Die In Prison

BREAKING NEWS

In some breaking news out of Melbourne this morning, it has been confirmed that a dirty old rock spider will likely die in prison, despite the hard efforts of John Howard, Tony Abbott and Andrew Bolt.

This comes after Cardinal George Pell, the former 3rd highest-ranking official in the Catholic Church had his appeal quashed this morning. 

The rock spider lost his appeal against his convictions over sexual offences against two choir boys in Melbourne in the 1990’s.

In March he was sentenced to six years in prison, after a jury found him guilty of five offences including sexual penetration of a child.

In a two-one ruling, justices from Victoria’s Court of Appeal turned down an appeal by cardinal Pell’s lawyers. 

He will now likely spend the rest of his life with plenty of incarcerated felons whose lives fell apart after having their childhood stolen from them at the hands of powerful religious leaders like Pell.

That news has lead the non-pro-life members of the nation to breathe a sigh of relief that the former Cardinal will not be getting out of prison. 

Andrew Bolt and Tony Abbott are yet to give comment on the decision, but it’s believed the former is already penning a 2,000-word piece about why the Court of Appeal got it wrong.

Local Bushie Reckons He Was A Bit Of Les Norton Back In The Day

TEXT:

One local cattleman from the back country of Queensland, who has a vague history of playing a relatively high standard of rugby league, is today reminiscing on a possibly exaggerated stint in the big smoke as a young fella.

Noel Ingham (53) says you’d be surprised how bloody accurate the new ABC program Les Norton is, at least for him anyway.

“Mate, it was exactly like that when I was living down there” says Noel.

“We used to be the only blokes wearing RMs at the pub”

“The sheilas used to love the country boys”

Based on the famous Robert G. Barrett novels, Les Norton tells the story of country bloke from outback Queensland who blows into Sydney on the run from a troubled past after leaving a rival footballer ‘proper fucked’. He lands a job as a bouncer at an illegal casino and finds himself dragged into a web of underground criminality and first grade footy of 1980s Sydney.

While Noel Ingham never played first grade, and never worked in the cross, and has a pretty luckless love life until he met his wife of thirty years, and has never been in a blue off the footy field – he says this long-awaited TV show is exactly what it was like for him during his brief stint living in the city.

However, this is not an isolated incident. A recent report by the National Party has found that one in three blokes west of Toowoomba reckon they were a bit of a Les in their day, particularly red nuts.

These particular coulda-beens love telling stories about drinking piss for three days straight at an early opener. Several high-profile coulda-been-Les’s include former Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce and former pop star Normie Rowe.

With each episode exploring yet another nostalgic adventure of pre-ICAC Sydney, it is expected that Noel’s tall yarns are going to get even taller. 

At time of press, he was reportedly telling some of the new ringers that he nearly got a start as an extra in Crocodile Dundee II, but had to turn it down because his old man needed him at home during the drought.

Trent Denny’s satisfaction came from having to shove everything in his mouth at once and getting the full hit of the best flavour combo ever. His annoyance came from him wanting to eat the biscuit and cheese bite by bite.

Speaking with The Advocate shortly after the crumbling catastrophe, Trent offered some sage suggestions on how this situation might be avoided in the future.

“Firstly, if you’re going to serve cubes, serve ‘em with Jatz – those things don’t break.”

“Secondly, just slice up the cheese. It’s madness to think anyone’s gonna be able to politely enjoy some cheese and bickies if you pair a Bega cube with a wafer.”

Trent is completely right; however, he might have a little trouble getting Beth at the South Betoota RSL to put any extra effort into what she serves in the pokie room.

Pastry Crumbs Scattered On Boyfriend’s Seat Indicate He’s Spoiled Another Dinner Date

TEXT:

A local chippy has been betrayed by a delicious, freshly baked meat pie from Brooke’s Bakery this afternoon after the perfectly flaky crust managed to scatter itself all over the front seat of his ute.

In what should have been the perfect crime, Dane Littlejohn is now explaining to his girlfriend how it was the apprentice who ate a pie in his ute, not him, and that he still had heaps of room for dinner.

“Far out, Dan, I can’t believe you’ve ruined another dinner,” moaned an irritated Chantelle.

“No babe, it wasn’t me!” he protested, before realising how ridiculous his defence was and coming clean.

“Ok, it was me. But, it’s not ruined, I’ve still got heaps of room!” rebutted Dane, for the first time questioning whether he did in fact have heaps of room.

It’s believed this isn’t the first time Dane’s gluttony has got the better of him and ruined dinner. 

A few weeks ago, Dane filled up on cheese and biscuits before a dinner that Chantelle had prepared for him.

Speaking with The Advocate after the event, Dane explained that it wasn’t actually his fault that he couldn’t wait until dinner.

“It’s evolutionary. My brain doesn’t know where its next meal is coming from so it makes me eat all the time, just in case a famine happens.”

“So, it’s not my fault. Can you tell Chan that?”

Our reporter declined to intervene.

Report: Kieran Reckons He Fucking Sent It Last Night Aye

TEXT:

A new report has emerged this morning claiming that Kieran Wilson went ‘full send’ last night.

That allegation stems from the mouth of the man himself, who just proclaimed to a few mates down at a French Quarter cafe that he ‘fucking sent it last night aye.’ 

Rolling in a reasonable time before midday to touch base with some friends he had seen for a couple of weeks, Kieran decided to treat the two tables flanking his own to a vague rundown of what’s happened in the last 18 hours or so. 

“Farkkkkkkkk (sic),” said Kieran taking a sip from the room temperature table water. 

“We fucking gave it a nudge aye.” 

“Like proper sent it.” 

“Was a good send too.” 

Kieran’s friends, who also had a bit of a go last night, nodded, waiting for Kieran to use a descriptive word other than send, or nudge.

“Early evening work drinks, into the Pogo Stick, into kick ons at Phil’s, into bed just before the sun.”

“I’m not in a great way to be honest.”

“We on for tonight?”

Two Full Length Documentaries Still Struggle To Cover How Much Of A Fuckwit Andrew Bolt Is

TEXT:

When it comes to long-form documentaries that delve into our nation’s deep-seated insecurities surrounding our post-settlement cultural deficit and the subsequent hostility we as a mob show towards high profile blackfellas, Australians are spoilt for choice this August! 

With two documentaries surrounding the embarrassing two years that saw the bogan masses, who support the inferior Southern brand of football, boo Sydney Swans superstar Adam Goodes into retirement.

The most recent of the two, The Australian Dream, now follows hot on the heels of the first one that was screened on Channel 10, The Final Quarter. 

Despite covering the same subject matter, the two documentaries are told very differently. While the Final Quarter tells the story of the last three years of Goodes’ career, before his retirement in 2015, using only archival footage for TV broadcasts – The Australian Dream includes interviews with both players, management, and political commentators.

In The Australian Dream, Goodes and a whole range of other iconic Aboriginal footballer – who have been treated like shit by Victorians and Western Australians over the years – give their side of the story in heartbreaking detail.

Eddie McGuire apologises profusely for his racist on-air comments that arguably sparked the mob mentality abuse of Adam Goodes – using one of possibly the dumbest excuses of all time to explain his behaviour:

“I said the opposite of what I was thinking.”

2GB shock jock Alan Jones asked, and in fact fought, to not be included in either documentary, probably because he knew how bad he would come off looking – however NewsCorp collumnist and prominent rock spider apologist Andrew Bolt was more than willing to put his name to the comments he made at the time.

While both documentaries do as much as they can to dissect Australia’s dark undertone of white supremacy born out of populism in politics and the sensationalist vilification of Aboriginal people that has been allowed in our media – one thing that is not explained is how Andrew Bolt came to be such a fuckwit.

Even with some of Australia’s great thinkers offering their two cents, it seems two full-length documentaries only just cover how much of a fuckwit Andrew Bolt was for that 18 months of Australian history.

This leaves many to question if Andrew Bolt is in fact the biggest fuckwit of all time.

The answer is yes.

NRL Player Manages To Polish Off A Bag Without Sending Any Pictures Or Videos To His Mates

TEXT:

In some breaking news out of the Harbour City of Sydney, a professional Rugby League player has managed to give it a bit of nudge, without capturing the entire thing on camera this weekend. 

The news has shocked the Rugby League fraternity, with plenty reeling this morning after it was confirmed that Baden Simpson polished off a bag with a mate without taking a single picture or video. 

Simpson, a reliable 154 game veteran managed to do so at a good friends wedding yesterday, with allegations that he also managed to just have a few beers without getting too carried away. 

That news has shocked the game of rugby league, whose players seem to love filming everything they do and sending it out across various platforms.

Speaking exclusively to The Advocate this morning, Simpson told us that he doesn’t really feel the need to send grainy Snapchats of himself hooking into some Stockbrokers Snow. 

“Yeah, I don’t know, I was just having a good time with some mates for school and we gave it a nudge. I didn’t really get my phone out last night, so I somehow managed not to film myself doing stuff that could jeopardise my 400,000 dollars a year contract,” he said. 

“I don’t think it’s that big a deal, and it’s pretty fucking ridiculous that you’ve called me at 9 am on a Sunday morning to be honest. Who are you?  My fucking parents?”

The line then went dead. 

The NRL is yet to comment on whether the player will be stood down for bringing the game into disrepute.

Hit 2000s TV Show Wipeout To Return For One-Off Stock Exchange Special

TEXT:

In exciting news for gameshow TV fans, the incredibly popular Wipeout is set to return to screens across the country. 

The new one-off special is expected to be aired next week and feature a thrilling obstacle course called the ASX. 

The show that broadcast in the mid-2000s before being pulled was a reality competition, where contestants try to navigate an extreme obstacle course that has been designed to provoke an unprecedented number of crashes, face plants and wipeouts, with one competitor taking home a $50,000 prize each week.

In this year’s edition, stockbrokers and finance people will try and navigate a special pop-up course in a stock exchange where they’ll try and save the portfolio’s they manage. 

This comes after 60 billion dollars was wiped out of the Australia Share market today amid fears that a recession could be knocking on the door. 

“We don’t want to reveal too much ahead of the screening, but it should be pretty exciting,” a producer. 

“In a new feature, the state of the art obstacle course, which we’ve titled the Bull Run, will feature homeless people and charity muggers who the stockbrokers will have to dodge as well.”

“And before you ask, no we won’t be testing for performance-enhancing drugs.”

Confirmation of the airing date is expected to be provided in the coming days.

NSW Government Tries To Rebrand Sydney As A Tourism Hotspot By Painting Ibises Flamingo Pink

TEXT:

Following the finds that the Sydney lock-out laws have all but fucked the city’s nightlife and reputation as an international city, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has moved quickly to reposition the city as a tropical getaway.

By spray-painting the city’s feral ibises hot pink, the NSW Government believes that tourists will come rushing back to the boring, lifeless state capital.

“Haha who needs nightclubs!?” said Berejiklian during a live press conference in Barangaroo this morning.

“We’ve got colourful birds!!”

“You know how the Asian tourists were rushing to get photos with the jacaranda trees in North Sydney. Well, this is the same thing…”

“Tourists will be rushing to get a photo in front of every public bin in the city!”

This comes after the 2016 announcement from the National Party that the Ibis should now be referred to as a ‘bin-chicken’.

This follows a series of complaints from official Zoologists, who feel the word Ibis should not apply to the Australianised species.

“Ibis is an African word to describe a majestic and elegant wading bird. In Australia, it is the opposite. the Australian ibis is fucking disgusting” said Barnaby Joyce, the Agricultural Minister at the time

“If we had other land animals like cats or dogs snooping around the bins in our cities parks like these birds we’d have them swiftly put to sleep in a makeshift CBD kennel”

However, the flamingo-pink rebrand for is as much a rebrand for the ibis as it is for the city, according to Berejiklian.

“Buy trapping these things in a cage and forcibly spray-painting them with a hot pink can of Ironlak, we are giving them a new lease on life” says the NSW Premier.

“Scavenging food and plastics from public parks has never looked so Caribbean!”

Physio Hasn’t Got A Chip On Her Shoulder About Not Getting Into Medicine, So Just Drop It

TEXT:

A local physiotherapist has issued a public declaration today. 

The 26-year-old health professional name Laura Jane has asked everyone to ‘stop fucking asking whether she wanted to get into medicine.’

Nearly 2 years out from her degree, the young Betoota Grove woman has moved to assure friends, family, current and future clients that she actually doesn’t care that she never got into medicine. 

Despite seagulls flocking to her when she goes within 100 metres of the ocean, Jane explained that she definitely doesn’t have a chip on her shoulder. 

“I literally don’t care, and I don’t know why everyone fucking asks me about it,” said the young woman today. 

“I wouldn’t want to have done Med if I had got in any way I don’t think,” explained the therapist who fires shots at doctors and surgeons whenever she can. 

“Doctors and surgeons are a bit detached if you ask me, so I’m happy that I can have a hands impact on peoples lives.” 

“So if everyone could stop asking me about it,  or raising the topic of whether I would have, or ever would want to have done med, that would be great.” 

“Just drop it. It’s not an issue, and I can’t believe I’m talking to the Home Brand version of the Betoota Bugle about it anyway.”

City2Surf Gives Bondi Residents Actual Reason To Rock PE Nation

TEXT:

While the nation’s charity organisations were looking forward to Sunday’s City 2 Surf, there’s another large group of people whose eagerness almost outweighed them – Bondi’s PE Nation wearers.

PE Nation is the activewear of choice for almost all Bondi residents, but up until now they haven’t had many actual reasons to wear it.

While most people assume you would wear it to workout, only 8% of PE Nation wearers in Bondi have actually worn theirs to exercise.

The Advocate sat down with long time Bondi resident, Lucy Lawson, to gauge her excitement around using her activewear for its intended purpose.

“It’s so good, finally all those haters can get off my back!”

“I’m not going to run though, my friend Sash and I are just going to walk and take selfies, we don’t want to sweat in our P-Naish [sic]”

“We actually bought new season stuff so we’re walking in last season just in case we sweat” finished Lucy.

The City 2 Surf is a popular road running event held in Sydney covering a 14km course through the city and the Eastern suburbs. The event attracts more than 80,000 entrants, both local and international.

Rob Monghatti, Betoota’s fastest man, has been invited back for the 5th time and he kindly took some time out of his pre-race prep to speak with The Advocate about this year’s race.

“Feelin’ good, conditions look pretty good down there. Bit of wind but I reckon that’ll work in my favour – what with the westerly’s that’ve been howling through Betoota I reckon a bit of Sydney wind might make me go faster!”

Spectacular Drunken Argument Topped Off By Silent Mate Staring Into Oblivion

TEXT:

The Flight Path District played scene to a drunken argument between friends earlier this week that made up in decibels what it lacked in substance.

Witness reports are varied but the drunken conversation is believed to be about veganism, Australia Day and Coles Minis with some sources stating Israel Falou may have been in the mix at some point as well.

As everyone piled on to give their session beer powered opinions, it eventually became clear that group member Oliver Povic felt much more comfortable remaining silent and gazing intensely into oblivion while the argument raged around him.

“We were just getting into some serious discussion about legalising pingas to treat PTSD and Ollie is just staring at the wall like a window has opened up into another universe filled entirely with emptiness,” stated drunken arguer Kim Trenton.

“Later we were arguing about child sex dolls for paedophiles and Ollie still managed to be the creepy one. Just looking. At nothing.”

According to witness reports, Povic was unsuccessfully ushered into the conversation several times but found himself to be much more at home looking through the fabric of the world into a realm where discourse was conducted with respect and temperance. 

When Povic did finally speak it was to ask if anyone wanted to share an Uber with him, hammering in the final nail in the coffin of disagreements between friends that would surely be exhumed the next time they binge drink together.

Speaking exclusively with The Advocate Povic did provide his opinion on the many drunken arguments his friends had while he wished the alcohol would leave his body and take part of his soul with it.

“They are all stupid cunts.”

Local Woman Informs World That She Now Has A Disposable Income With Dyson Purchase

A Betoota Heights woman has let the world at large know that she’s now living very comfortably. 

Ashley Wilson informed everyone of the fact she’s no longer managing her finances on a week to week basis by purchasing an exorbitantly priced vacuum cleaner. 

The lawyer at an Old City District firm called Charging Bull & Associates confirmed to The Advocate this afternoon that she is now comfortable enough financially to drop more than an average wage after tax on a household cleaning appliance. 

“Yeah, I cleared the credit card a long time ago, I don’t have any dependents and I live in my own studio so I’m at a stage in my life where I can start placing value on big-ticket quality items,” she explained. 

Wilson then explained that she did think twice about spending nearly 1200 bucks on a vacuum cleaner.

“It’s a lot of money, but I’ve got it now. I’ve finally made it into the Upper Middle Class and I’ve got a disposable income.”

“I guess all those long weeknights spent at my desk slaving away are all worth it now.”

Simmons Allowed Into Crown After Returning With Chinese Passport, Permission Slip From Dutton

TEXT:

Crown Casino has finally allowed Australian basketball superstar Ben Simmons into their venue today, days after he claimed to have been racially profiled by bouncers at the venue’s gambling room entrance.

Simmons, 23, told his 4.3 million followers on Instagram that he was barred from the casino after staff demanded he present ID, while his white colleague breezed through.

Simmons deleted the Instagram video but later responded to claims on Twitter that he was barred because he was wearing camouflage patterned pants, breaching the casino’s dress code, stating that they were all wearing camo pants – even the white guy that got in.

However, today after the Casino went into PR damage control and immediately called to meet with the superstar – it appears Ben Simmons has been allowed back into the casino.

“We’ve informed our bouncers that he isn’t just any young African-Australian man from Melbourne” said a spokesperson.

“He’s a very rich one”

“But just to be sure, we’ve advised Mr Simmons to become a Chinese national and that way he will be able to use the VVIP entrance next time he arrives here”

It is believed that Simmons has since gotten his hands on a Chinese passport, as well as a permission slip from Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton – who will be doing every thing he can to ensure that Simmons if given the same treatment as the Chinese gang members and politicians who are waved through security at the airport and driven directly to the casino high-rollers lounge by government agents – as revealed in last week’s 60 Minutes.

Ben Simmons told reporters he can’t believe it took him this long to realise the only way to avoid being singled out as a minority in Australia is to become a citizen of another country.

A local Betoota Heights man returning from Europe named Tony Williams has confirmed that he is, in fact, effectively a full-blown alcoholic now. 

“Legit though, I’m actually fucked [haha]” laughed the young man touching down this afternoon.

“I think I’m an alcoholic now,” said the traveller confusing the crippling disease with his recreational drinking at tourist night clubs in European cities. 

Williams then told our reporters that his liver ‘actually hurts’ despite not actually being able to anatomically locate the organ when prompted. 

“Fuck, Budapest man. I wish I could tell you how that was, but I can’t even remember. It was good I think,” laughed the young man under the impression he was the first person to have a few beers in Europe.

Crown Casino Offer To Take Ben Simmons Wombat Hunting As A Way Of Apologising For The Racism

TEXT:

Crown Casino has responded after a video from Aussie NBA star Ben Simmons appeared to suggest he was racially profiled after being held up by security at the entry to the embattled gambling venue in Melbourne.

The Instagram video was posted by the Philadephia 76ers All-Star last night before it was deleted. It showed Melbourne-born Simmons taking aim at security who he claimed turned him and his friends away because of their skin colour.

“I find it so crazy that the only guy who doesn’t get checked to go into the casino is this guy,” Simmons said in the video, before turning the camera on a white person in his entourage.

“I get checked, Mike gets checked and Tys gets checked. Thank you Crown Casino, damn, and they didn’t let me in, or him or this guy. Wow, we got a long way to go.”

Crown have moved quick to neutralise this PR disaster, after an absolute belting over the last few weeks – with non-stop investigations into the Casino lobbying Immigration and Border Force to provide seamless processing for high-rolling Chinese aristocrats and gang members.

Crown have issued an apology to Ben Simmons for treating him like one of those made up African gang members that everyone in Melbourne keeps reading about in the Herald Sun.

The Casino have also offered to provide him with the (V)VIP treatment: An invitation for him and his mates to go wombat hunting this weekend.

Common wombats are a protected species in Victoria, except in 193 districts including Murrindindi where the animals have been declared unprotected wildlife.

It is in these regions that Crown has been hosting VIP Casino guests, and taking them on wombat hunting safaris.

According to 60 Minutes, high-rolling tourists are being invited to hunt and kill wombats at a luxury hunting lodge run by a Chinese businessman who is a Crown partner with alleged crime links. It is just one of many of the bizarre and legally grey activities that the Federal Government has aided the casino in providing for their international guests.

However, Crown Casino will not be adding Australia’s most bankable athlete to that list of high priority guests, after failing to lure him out of the IBIS Budget Hotel that he checked into down the road after the racist incident.

The offer to go wombat hunting was also declined – after Simmons pointed out that shooting wombats is sick and depraved and not really a service that Crown Casino should be providing people with.

“Is This What You Fucken Morons Were Going For?”

TEXT:

After 29 civilians were murdered in cold blood in two different shootings across America yesterday, Australians are now posing the question to Pauline Hanson and her cronies if these kinds of senseless gun murders are what they were hoping to achieve by meeting with the NRA and asking them to help them erode democracy in our country by asking for tens of millions of dollars in gun lobby funding.

A total of 20 people were killed in the majority Latino city, nestled in western Texas on the US-Mexico border, as federal authorities investigated a potential hate crime and local prosecutors charged a 21-year-old white man with murder and said they would pursue the death penalty.

Less than 13 hours later another mass shooting took place in the city of Dayton, Ohio, leaving nine dead there and bringing the total injured from both shootings to at least 52.

As was outlined in Al-Jazeera’s ‘How To Sell A Massacre’ exposè – two of Pauline Hanson’s closest confidantes and high-ranking One Nation figures were caught out by undercover journalists while trying to chase foreign political donations in exchange for weakening Australian gun laws.

Al Jazeera conducted a 3-year-long operation to uncover this activity, by having a person called Rodger Muller pose as the head of a fake gun lobby group ‘Gun Rights Australia’, then having Muller record meetings he attended with Steve Dickson (former QLD leader on One Nation) and James Ashby (Hanson’s chief of staff and experienced political reptile).

Speaking to Rodger Muller, Dickson said, “If they threw ten million dollars at us, we could fucking win a heap of seats. Plus a shitload of seats in the senate… Mate; if you make this shit happen, I’ll make sure we open any fucking door you need open…”  

During the meetings with the NRA, Dickson said, “We get the balance of power, very simply that means that we have the testicles of the Government in our hand at every given stage.”

Throughout the documentary, Pauline Hanson also engages in full-blown conspiracy-peddling, by suggesting the 35 men, women and children that were slaughtered in Australia’s last spree-killing in Port Arthur in 1996 were actually killed by the government in a false flag operation aimed at bringing in gun control to disarm outback farmers and suburban rednecks.

The fact that One Nation is also the go-to political party for white nationalist extremists doesn’t look good either, considering the fact that most of these mass-shootings are being committed by neo-nazis.

Pauline Hanson was approached for comment on the shootings today, instead she decided to talk about how Al-Jazeera is an Arab word and that their journalism shouldn’t count because they are obviously linked to the Muslims.

Definition Of Snack Becomes Broader After Fifth Cone

TEXT:

Research teams at the CSIRO are finalising a report that could provide strong evidence of cannabis being positively used to increase imaginative ability and outside of the box thinking.

The five-year research piece has already generated a lot of attention after providing a study group of 90 regular cannabis smokers with money just for punching a couple of cones.

One finding that has already been released to the public is how the definition of a snack automatically becomes much broader after ingesting a fifth cone.

“After cone number five we see the most amazing thing happen,” stated head of research Rajit Dhawan PhD.

“They look around their kitchen, a new world of snacks has opened up to them. Things that never seemed like food before now have them salivating with anticipation. The spring cleaning of the pantry begins.”

Dhawan provided several examples where test subjects displayed culinary ingenuity after ingesting a fifth cone. 

“After a fifth cone of cannabis one subject added milk to a near-empty tin of dry yeast thinking it was Milo. Some of them even ate fruit.”

“They also cut down on cleaning time by eating everything straight from the packaging. Tuna, peanut butter, dry cereal, they eat it all straight from the vessel hence saving time for more cones later.”

“And Banana, Hollandaise and ham apparently.”

One section of the study also outlined how regular cannabis use could influence imagination before even the first cone.

“We saw many ordinary pieces of household waste become bongs. Not just Orchy bottles but milk bottles, coffee jars, salad dressing tubes, Pringle tins and even once an empty ironing aid spray bottle was fashioned into a very ergonomic waterpipe.”

Barnaby Joyce Quickly Logs Out Of Uber Driver App As Channel 9 Crew Rush The Landcruiser

TEXT:

The recently-povo Former Deputy Prime Minister, Barnaby Joyce has today played it cool after nearly being caught out doing Uber runs on the side in his $95,000 taxpayer-funded luxury Toyota Landcruiser.

This follows a tumultuous few days for the Member Of New England, who has found himself in the humiliating predicament of being humiliated by the least qualified Federal Senator to ever grace the mothership, Pauline Hanson.

Hanson told the commercial television network breakfast show that pays her to say racist things each morning that she has no sympathy whatsoever for Barnaby Joyce after he complained he was struggling to make ends meet on his $211,000 salary.

The leader of One Nation went after Mr Joyce for  claimed he’s struggling to support his two families on his $211k salary – in an attempt to explain why he’s calling for an increase to unemployment benefits.

But Senator Hanson says it’s unfair for him to complain when so many Australians are doing it tough on far less money, especially when so many politicians like her are engaging in class treason by voting to slash penalty wages and keep the Newstart benefits at an inhumane 1997 rate of $40 a day.

However, while Hanson and Joyce’s fellow Reaganist colleagues snigger at his financial woes, the Member For New England seems to be really going out of his way for a bit of extra coin to support his two families that make up eight independent lives, not including his own.

This has lead some people to think that maybe the cost of living in Australia is actually extortionate, considering how stagnant not only our Newstart benefits are, but also our award wage.

Following revelations of Joyce using the Tamworth return-and-earn, getting caught up in multivitamin pyramid schemes and trying his hand at social media influencing – it seems the father-of-six is now delving into the highly casualised ‘gig economy’.

“What’s that?” asked a reporter, after storming his Landcruiser this afternoon somewhere in Guyra.

“Ahh nothing” said Barnaby.

“Just checking the weather app. Seems like they got a few inches in the plains”

“Anyway, gotta go. See you lot later. I have to go see a man about a dog”

“Or should I say a FIFO miner about a ride to the pub haha”

Barnaby Joyce Caught Minesweeping Empties At The Pub

TEXT:

The recently-povo former Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce has today held strong on his thin household budget, by somehow getting away with only spending $20 on a night out with his mates at the New England Hotel in Armidale.

This comes days after Mr Joyce made it publicly clear that he has been forced to turn the heater off at night, kill and butcher his own meat, avoid going out for dinner and buy cheap groceries.

“It’s not that I’m not getting money, it’s just that it’s spread so thin.”

“It’s just a great exercise in humility going from deputy prime minister to watching every dollar you get.”

Just earlier this morning, Barnaby was spotted first in line at a prominent Tamworth Return-and-Earn depot, after taking home a big haul on bin night.

The former Ag Minister has taken to low-level micro-influencing on Instagram.

However, even though times are tough – Barnaby points out that his two-family-budget isn’t as terrifying as the prospect of being on Newstart.

“I’m not crying in my beer because there are thousands, thousands doing it much tougher than me” Mr Joyce said.

“And it ain’t my beer anyway. I just finish off everyone’s empties haha.”

Joyce then went on to explain how you can get away with two $10 Tiger jugs and a couple raids of the empties in the beer garden.

“Minesweep!” he shouts.

“Hahaha”“Oi but don’t tell McMormack or Scomo. They’ll get so cut at me if they knew I’m being poor in public”

Local publican, Brett Howard-Abbott (52) says that while Barnaby’s pub ettiquette is rather anti-social, the bar staff are inclined to turn a blind eye until he gets back on his feet.

“At least he’s having a go.” says Brett.

“He’ll get a go soon enough”

Report: Tamworth Rivers Getting A Lot More Love From Barnaby Than The Murray-Darling Rivers

TEXT:

The recently-povo former Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce has been spotted rolling down Peel Street in Tamworth with a new range of rip off RM moleskins and poly-blend button ups.

Due to having a Catholic amount of kids on the measly base salary of $211k plus benefits, the Member For New England is now unable to shop at his preferred menswear retailer, The Blue Blood Outfitters in Walcha.

In fact, things are so grim that he can’t even afford the working man’s dress-wear, RB Sellars.

This has forced the father-of-six into the desperate circumstance of having to spend a bit of time looking at Rivers. Which, according to the NSW Farmers Conference last week – isn’t something he’s fond of doing.

This follows an urgency motion presented on the final day of the conference in Sydney, which called for a Commonwealth royal commission into the Murray-Darling Basin Plan (MDBP).

The motion was put before the conference by the association’s horticulture committee chair Guy Gaeta and passed with a narrow margin 59-47 – as it was revealed that not enough people were benefitting form the rort of water theft to warrant to catastrophic affects it was having on the environment.

“Ahhh. They’ve got some good stuff in here” said Barnaby, while inspecting the New England’s premier affordable menswear outlet.

“Vikki has been trying to dress me like a trendy tree-changer, but my mug doesn’t look that good in a New York yankees cap”

Joyce says that while he’s spreading his household budget pretty thin nowadays, he’s nowhere near having to sink as low as stealing from the Tamworth Rivers.

“Do I look like I grow cotton?” asked Barnaby.

“I’m not even wearing cotton anymore”

Barnaby Joyce First In Line With A Big Haul At The Tamworth Return-And-Earn This Morning

The former Deputy Prime Minister’s financial hardship was on display for all of his electorate this morning, after the young father was spotted waiting outside the Services NSW office in Tamworth this morning – with a trolley full of cans and bottles.

Joyce, who yesterday declared he was struggling to get by on his parliamentary wage, is on a $280,000 package with taxpayer-funded car and telephone – is being sneered at by his coalition colleagues – most of whom come from rich families and haven’t ever had to worry about having the safety net pulled out from underneath them.

Yesterday Barnaby came under fire for linking his circumstances with people on Newstart, which is as low as $40 a day.

However, the poor little Barny Blues appear to be coming from a good place, as The member for New England breaks ranks with his have-a-go-get-a-go government and calls for the rate of New­start to increase – stating that his cost of living is testing enough, and said he can’t imagine being actually povo.

While his opposition and his alleged colleagues are making a point of ridiculing him for being poor or at least claiming to be doing it tough with a Catholic amount of kids and two households in his budget, today’s discovery adds an element of legitimacy to his financial woes.

Standing outside the return-and-earn drop off, covered in sweat and pushing a big hall from last night’s raids of local skip bins – Barnaby really did look the part.

“Those blue bloods up on the hill don’t even seperate the recyclables” he giggled.

“Gotta love bin night haha”

However, as has been the case with Barnaby over the last five or so years, things didn’t really go to plan.

“Aww fuck me!” he said.

“The machine’s fucken broken!”

“Fuck this fucken shit! Now I gotta push this fucken trolley all the way to Carlo’s IGA”

Man Who Has No Actual Interest In Music Claims To Like Bob Dylan

TEXT:

A local man has shocked his more cultured colleagues today by telling them that Bob Dylan is his favourite musician. 

Garry Park (27) revealed this unlikely truth after a group of them were discussing music over a couple of beers.

Reports from the scene paint a pretty clear picture of the event, witnesses say that the colleagues all turned to each other with doubtful expressions before laughing in Garry’s face.

The Advocate sat down with Garry to try and find out why he lied, especially to a group of people who were so clearly into music.

“I dunno, he was the first name that popped into my head”

“I just hated not being involved in the conversation,” said a remorseful Garry.

According to his colleagues, they never believed Garry.

“No one actually likes Bob Dylan’s music”

“If they tell you they do, they’re lying. Or private school boys desperate for something that’ll give them an edge,” quite rightly put one of Garry’s colleagues.

With work looming on Monday, it remains unclear whether Garry will come clean on his claim, or he’ll continue the charade and wear a Bob Dylan printed T-Shirt to work in hopes of convincing them.

Brisbane Yuppie Takes Advantage Of 2-Week-Window Where Her North Face Jacket Makes Sense

TEXT:

Local Highgate Hill-based book critic, Anna Leighmachors (32) is today relishing in the 21 degree high sweeping across the city.

This is mainly becase her mid-July purchase of a trendy new North Face puffer jacket has now been validated by it’s fifth outing, which equates to $85 per wear.

As a young urban corporate creative (sometimes referred to as a YUCCIE) Anna says she very seldom gets the chance to wear the same clothes as her kindred spirits in Sydney and Melbourne.

“This cold snap is giving me the perfect excuse to justify my new Northie” says Anna, who probably could have gotten away with a long sleeve dress.

“I actually didn’t get the chance to go to Dark Mofo this year, so it’s great to have the opportunity to trot this out in Brisbane.”

However, with the Ekka right around the corner, Anna knows that her two week window to wear heavy dark clothing is about wrap up – that’s not saying she won’t push through until the last Brisbane Lion’s home game.

“Sometimes it gets really cold at the Gabba in late September” she says.

“I might have to leave the scarf at home, though. Out of my entire wardrobe, a woollen AFL scarf makes the least sense in a tropical land locked city”

Influencer Visits Career Counsellor After New Instagram Changes Threaten Her Entire Existence

TEXT:

Local softcore pornography content creator, Pammy Broakley (27) has today had to endure the most humiliating moment of her young adult life.

That is, visiting a career guidance counsellor to toy up her options as an unskilled worker in the current Australian economy.

This comes as Instagram users in Australia are now no longer able to see how many “likes” a post has a received under trial changes to “remove pressure” on the digital platform’s users. Which is a vague nod to the fact that the multinational tech giant are starting to think they might be causing an pandemic of mental health problems.

As of today, Instagram will now be rolling out the trial update removing the total number of likes on photos and viewings of videos on user feeds and profiles, and permalink pages – which is a huge change to their current user experience, leaving many to question if their true motivation is one of genuine concern for their self-validation-obsessed customers – or is it about promoting sponsored content that usually gets ignored for photos of hot chicks in bikinis.

Users will still be able to see a list of likes on their posts, just not the overall number.

However, these changes look like they might crush small and large businesses right around Australia, including self-employed insta-babes like Pammy.

As a late-twenties rigtrepreneur, Pammy is now forced to consider the possibility of becoming a mature aged student at the Betoota TAFE or local Catholic University – after deciding not to study in, or after, school the moment she hit 14k followers at the age of 16.

“How are my news sponsors, BLEACHEDPEACH pussy whitening, supposed to know how many people liked my most recent post of me lying on the side of pool in t-string lingerie?!” she questions.

“I’m not sure Pammy” says the career counsellor, Glenn (56).

“Have you ever thought of getting into catering?”

“Maybe some temp work archiving at the courthouse?”

Exhausted Melbourne Woman Stuck In Coffee Dead Zone Between 3 And 5pm

TEXT:

A Melbourne woman is recovering from the harrowing experience of getting stuck in the city’s infamous “coffee dead zone” — the chunk of time in the afternoon between three and five pm.

“I’ve heard of it happening to other people before. I just never thought I’d be one of them,” Catherine Elliott, 28, told The Advocate.

How did she find herself in this predicament? After a big night out the evening before, Elliott slept in exceptionally late. By the time she got herself up and dressed and went to seek out some coffee, it was too late.

“It was horrible, every café was closed but none of the restaurants were open yet. I felt so trapped.”

The experience has raised a lot of questions for Elliott. Questions nobody, it seems, has the answers to.

“Who decided people aren’t allowed to have coffee after 3pm? Isn’t that a decision we should be able to make for ourselves? This is bullshit.”

The City of Melbourne could not be reached for comment.

Quiet Australians Now Even Quieter After Realising Franking Credits Are Only For Rich People

TEXT:

A senior couple from Betoota’s Flight Path District who wholeheartedly backed Scott Morrison in the 2019 federal election have today learnt that they might have completely misunderstood the concept of dividend imputation.

Roy and Sheryl Gardner (both 76) say that after reading the Courier Mail for the entire election campaign, they were led to believe that Labor was going to pay for everything by effectively stealing their pension from them – or something like that.

While the words ‘franking credits’ were something they heard vaguely referred to on Sky News every night, they weren’t 100% sure what it was, but the whole idea of a Retiree Tax scared the shit out of them.

However, as they have learnt today, as lower-middle-class retirees who actually don’t own any shares, they had nothing to lose by voting for Labor – except for the crucial government services that will slashed in the imminent recession.

Dividend imputation is a corporate tax system in which some or all of the tax paid by a company may be attributed, or imputed, to the shareholders by way of a tax credit to reduce the income tax payable on a distribution. As  leading economists have pointed out, it was introduced in Australia as way for Peter Costello to squirrel away the disgusting amount of money that came out of the mining boom.

However, for those who don’t extort this tax loophole for a free ride, very little is known about Franking Credits, other than the fact that Labor wanted to scrap them, and that was a bad thing, according to every media outlet except the disgustingly biased ABC.

However, with Australian billionaire Dick Smith today revealing that even he knew fuck all about franking credits until he received $500,000 from the government this year, Roy and Sheryl are starting to learn that this was never about them.

“I’m not telling anyone who I voted for” says Roy, the Quiet Australian.

“Me either” says Sheryl, another Quiet Australian, currently sitting on a 22-month-waiting list at the Betoota public hospital for a cataract operation.

“It’s very embarrassing to think I got caught up in that whole Promise Of Australia”

“I’m staying very bloody quiet about that”

Katter Party MPs Investigated By CCC Over An Alleged Round Of Pina Coladas At The Mad Cow

TEXT:

A Corruption and Crime Commission (CCC) report has found that elected state government officials from the Katter Australian Party may have engaged in serious misconduct during a Friday arvo knock off at controversial nightclub/bar in Townsville’s main street.

The CCC investigated allegations that last Friday, Robbie Katter used his position as KAP’s Queensland State leader to persuade a bartender at The Mad Cow to ‘recommend something different’ – before ordering a round of pina coladas for fellow state MPs Shane Knuth (Hill) and Nick Dametto (Hinchinbrook)

The CCC investigations resulted in a large number of in-depth interviews with both bar staff from The Mad Cow and nearby AJs who claim to have witnessed Robbie Katter’s treasonous attempt to get off the Great Northerns.

While damning to the integrity of the greater KAP brand, the report does not recommend prosecution.

Federal KAP leader, Bob Katter III, says he’s not in a position to comment on Robbie’s brain snap – but has argued that something a politician can be forced into these kinds of compromises – especially when tasked with uniting the warring Tropical and Desert factions within the Katter Australia Party.

The report notes that Robbie Katter may lost his seat at the state election over this particular incident, but that’s the only way members of the public will be able to see him held accountable for his actions.

Robbie Katter has rejected the CCC findings, claiming the case centred around a half-pissed conversation he had with a bartender, where he was tricked into trying a cocktail named ‘The Strand Mate Hater’ – a mixture of Bundaberg Rum and pineapple cordial.

The CCC found that this constituted serious misconduct, despite the fact that the Member for Traeger opted against having the drinks served to his colleagues in hollowed out pineapples.

Lycra Clad City Worker Wondering What Else He’s Gotta Do For Someone To Bring Up ‘Le Tour’

TEXT:

A charismatic local accountant has today been left scratching his head today.

The cuff link enthusiast did so after turning up to his Old City District Office in Lycra for the 5th time this week, and yet again failing to get even a passing comment out of anyone. 

Obnoxiously clicking around in his custom-fitted bike shoes, squeezing water out of his bottle as loudly as possible and huffing and puffing between his desk and the staffroom kitchen, Wil Wilson said he doesn’t know what else he’s got to do. 

“Fuck me, do I have to put a sign up at my desk to let people know I’m the resident expert on The Tour De France” he sighed in the break room today. 

The rapidly aging late twenty-something man, said he doesn’t understand how no one is interested in the greatest show on two wheels this planet has to offer. 

“How can they not have even a slight interest in Le Tour, or the dynamics of the peloton, or even the famous French Wine and Cheese regions the cyclists power through,” he said crunching a trail bar. 

“And how can no one even bother to ask me why I’m in an expensive kit of lycra that I purchased along with my bike that cost as much as a good second-hand car,” explained the man nearly a decade too young to be going through a midlife crisis. 

“Drones, the lot of them.”

Government Puts Down MyGov Crash To Everyone Using The Website When Government Told Them To

TEXT:

As was expected, the MyGov website has crashed as Australians urgently try to file their tax returns on the first day of the government’s tax bonus payouts.

The portal, which millions of Australians use for Centrelink and tax purpose, returned an error message that was reminiscent of both the 2016 Census and the Optus coverage of the soccer world cup.

The ATO confirmed the news in a Tweet saying “some of our services are currently unavailable” with government experts putting the crash down to the fact that everyone wanted to use the website at the one time, so that they could file a tax return and not get in trouble with the taxman.

The MyGov meltdown is now part of a greater debate that has been triggered by the ongoing complaints surrounding the National Broadband Network – and the Government’s lack of interest in efficient internet in general.

“What we were hoping is that the NBN is so shit that not everyone could use the internet at once” said Communications Minister Paul Fletcher MP, who was very disappointed to be moved off the back bench after Morrison’s 2019 election win.

“But it turns out its just the website that couldn’t handle it. Don’t blame me. Blame the ATO. This is not an NBN issues”

“You Totally Get Me!” Says Woman On First Date With A Cop Who Routinely Accesses Her Metadata

TEXT:

Local woman Anita Goodman (31) has always described herself as unlucky in love.

That was until her friends set her up on blind date with local police officer Constable Reid Wodsapp last night.

Anita says she has no idea that she had actually met Reid at a barbecue three years, and he says he’s had an eye for her ever since.

Throughout the evening, the charming law enforcer impresses over and over again with his intuition. Starting off by ordering Anita’s favourite bottle of wine, before revealing that they both share the exact same taste in music and TV shows.

This comes after horrific findings were leaked during the parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security’s review of the mandatory data retention law, which has been in place since 2015.

Under the legislation, call records, IP addresses and other previously encrypted metadata is held by telecommunications companies for two years. A vast number of government agencies, including state and federal police, are now in a position where they don’t need a warrant to access the once the private digital movements of Australian citizens.

In total, the AFP has admitted to accessing metadata close to 20,000 times in the 2017-2018 financial year.

However, Australia’s increasingly dystopian police state is the last thing on Anita’s mind tonight, as her blind date continues to hit the mark with his ‘favourite baby names’ – and his in-depth understanding of her complex career description as a customer experience professional in the biomedical equipment industry.

“Oh my gosh” says Anita Goodman.

“I feel like we’ve known each other for ages!”

“You Get Less For Murder!” Says Needy Husband Who Has Ruined Every One Of His Wife’s Dreams

TEXT:

Local landscaper Dennis Falchi (65) has an important message to share with his employees who are forced to listen to his opinions.

After brickie James Bryce (26) announced his engagement during Monday smoko, Falchi began speaking about the hilarious prison of heterosexual marriage based on his own experiences of entering into a legally binding contract with a woman whose dreams he has ruined. 

“40 years I’ve been married! Mate, you get less for murder!” laughed Falchi as his large belly his wife no longer finds attractive shook with glee.

“That’s a life sentence!”

While newly engaged Bryce stated he was not offended by Falchi’s comments he claims to find them a bit rich as his boss has visibly destroyed every one of his wife’s dreams.

“I don’t know how Carol lives with Denny,” stated Bryce.

“She was a talented musician apparently but had to move her studio so Denny could set up a man cave. It made State of Origin so awkward.”

Falchi’s anti-marriage tirade appears to be another rant in a series of gags that are equally a cry for help as they are a cruel joke at the expense of a woman who sacrificed her autonomy so her husband’s business could be successful. 

“You getting some strippers for this bucks or what?”

At the time of writing Falchi has not been formally invited to Bryce’s bucks party.

Good Samaritan Turns On Hand Dryer For The Grunters When Leaving Bathroom

TEXT:

At first glance, Selene Henson, 29, seems like your average person today she’s being recognised as a modern day saint.

The Melbourne-based woman is now being recognized for her selflessness, after multiple substantiated reports of Selene lingering near the hand dryer in public toilets and office restrooms in order to provide noise cover for on-the-job poopers and public potty-users.

There seems to be no discernible motive for Selene’s altruistic behavior other than simple kindness.

“I’ve never seen anything like it. She must’ve stood there, pretending to dry her hands for a full 5 extra minutes,” Carol, 34, who experienced Selene’s kindness first-hand while shopping in Melbourne Central, told The Advocate. 

“Nobody has ever done anything that nice for me before.”

At least three more people have some forward claiming they were also the recipients of this Good Samaritan’s specific kind of charity.

“I’m a bit shy in the office restroom normally, and then when my boss followed me into the bathroom, I thought I was done for,” Steph, 41, a coworker of Selene’s, told reporters.  “But then there she was, running both facets and all the hand-dryers at once like some kind of lavatory angel.”

When reached for comment, the ‘Benefactress of the Bog,’ as some locals have begun to call her, was a woman of few words.

“What? Why are you asking me about what I do in the loo?” she told The Advocate. 

“This is really weird. Please go away.”

Christians Tighten The Belt On Community Outreach Programs Until Israel Folau Verdict

TEXT:

Pastors representing a range of different Australian churches have today revealed that the collection plates have been going a bit light since last Monday.

This comes as the benefactors of the most oppressed and marginalised majority in Australia redirect their goodwill towards a multi-millionaire former Wallabies player who breached his contract by posting homophobic memes on Instagram.

Folau, who owns a Lamborghini and a sizeable property portfolio, has relied on the Christian community community to help him pay for a legal defence.

In the same way his initial contract with Rugby Australia was terminated, Folau’s initial GoFundMe campaign was taken down for violating the platform’s terms and conditions.

Luckily, the Pentecostal political donor group The Australian Christian Lobby, was able to set up their own pro-homophobic crowd-funding exercise which raised over $2 million for the concussion riddled former Christian turned Hillsong Happy Clapper turned Nontrinitarian fundamentalist.

However, in a blow for people who actually rely on the love and support of Christians to survive in the winter, Folau’s record-breaking cash grab has resulted in a dip in offline donations, in actual churches.

However, one local rock star Evangelical says it’s definitely worth it.

“There will always be more needier causes than that of our own” says Betoota’s local Pentecostal Minister Fr. Rocco Spighter.

“If protecting Izzy’s right to denigrate gay people means that we have to cut back of feeding the homeless for the next few months, then it is something will we have to do do”

The presence of Christianity in Australia began with the foundation of a British colony at New South Wales in 1788. While Christianity remains the largest religion in Australia, declining religiosity and diversifying immigration intakes of recent decades have seen the percentage of the population identifying as Christian in the national census decline from 96.1% at the time of the Federation of Australia in the 1901 census, to 52.1% in the 2016 census.

Many paranoid Baby Boomers who are struggling with a severe case of misplaced nostalgia have put this dwindling followership down to our nation’s political climate. One that often lends itself to sinfully progressive ideas – such as the separation of church and state, and the normalisation of homosexual relationships.

“It’s not our fault that Rugby Australia are trying to sack a Christian for being Christian!” says Mr Spighter.

“Poverty is nothing compared to ensuring the survival of our varying and often contradictive ideologies”

“We would love to be investing our congregation’s donations towards soup kitchens and women’s shelters, but the discrimination faced by Christians at the hands of relatively conservative sporting bodies is by far the biggest battle we, as a people, face today!”

Sydney’s Severe Traffic Problems Completely Fixed After 4th Crack At Inner-City Light Rail

TEXT:

Sydney residents are rejoicing today, after the NSW Premier announced the end of the megacity’s comical traffic congestion issues.

As of next month, Light Rail vehicles will start making their way into the CBD for day testing in August, with night testing all the way to Circular Quay also shceduled

Gladys Berejiklian says it’ll be a sight Sydneysiders haven’t seen for half a century.

“I know everyone is regretting ripping up 291 kilometres of tram lines in the 1960s, but as the Liberal government of the time convincingly argued, we needed to get people used to the idea of driving cars”

“And yes, the Monorail in the 1980s was just a result of us getting a bit overexcited with the Bicentenial, we honestly thought we’d be hosting the Olympics in the nice part of Sydney back then”

Berejiklian quickly brushed over the third and arguably most pointless crack at inner-city light rail project between the poorer inner-western suburbs and in the Star Casino.

“This is the one we’ll talk about for years to come” said the Premier.

“As all of you know, it hasn’t come without its challenges,” she told reporters in Sydney on Wednesday.

“But today, soon we will successfully unveil a direct route between our largest public transport terminus, and the our largest horse racing track!”

The entire project was originally meant to cost taxpayers $1.6 billion but the bill has now blown out to a staggering $2.7 billion, after opting for foreign contracters to shave a couple hundred thousand off the initial project.

Channel 7 Stand By Decision To Broadcast M*A*S*H Reruns Instead Of Barty’s Wimbledon Opener

TEXT:

Channel 7 has defended its decision to stick with reruns of the prominent 1970s war comedy-drama TV show M*A*S*H rather than show the start of world number one Ash Barty’s Wimbledon opener.

As has been the case for the last 40 years, the program has been heavily rotated across every commercial TV network for some reason, and last night was no exception, as the controversial right-wing network opted to show some weird episode from the third season rather than switch over to watch Australia’s favourite athlete dominate the cannon fodder from China.

Currently world number one, The French Open champion needed just over an hour to do away with the 25-year-old Zheng Saisai with a 6-4, 6-2 on Court One.

A furious reaction from fans and sports commentators on social media prompted an explanation and apology from Channel 7 on the Sunrise program, who stuck by their decision to miss Barty’s opening sets because the M*A*S*H episode in question was getting to a really good bit of the series.

“We believe we made the right decision” said Channel 7 owner Kerry Stokes.

“We here at Channel 7 are of the opinion that war, and the storytelling of those involved in war, is something that Australians need more of”

Stokes believes that the fact that M*A*S*H is based around the Korea War, which is commonly referred to as ‘the forgotten war’ is all the more reason to prioritise it into prime time viewing. Especially over the tennis successes of ‘some tennis player from Ipswich’.

“It doesn’t matter how many times we hear these stories, or watch this arguably B-Grade sitcom, it is important to always keep this at the forefront of our minds” says Stokes, who is well known for his collection of Victoria Cross medal sets.

“Same goes for Kyrgios. He’s not going away anytime soon if I have anything to do with it. He’s the Korea War of Australian tennis”

Presence Of Schoolmate In Uni Lecture Crushes 1st-Year Student’s Dreams Of Re-Inventing Self

Things were looking up for young Hugo Watson-Wilson this year. 

With the start to his university degree all going to plan, a new friendship group formed, a new persona developed, the rest of his post-school life was looking promising. 

That was until today, when a classmate from his Betoota Grove school strolled right on into his History of Economics Lecture.

In that one cruel moment, Watson-Wilson said he felt like his entire world came crashing down. 

Moving to Melbourne from Betoota at the start of the year, the young Commerce student at a popular sandstone institution thought he had free reign to re-invent himself as a person. 

A process that he said had gone perfectly. 

“Man, I did the 3-month European tour, grew out the beard, changed my aesthetic and became a woker, cooler, looser version of myself,” said Watson-Wilson today. 

“The high school days of debating, sports mediocrity and struggling at interacting with people immediately outside of my friendship group seemed like an eternity ago.” 

“No one knew me down here, no one knew my story. No one knew I was a bit of a loser. I became cool Hugo.” 

“But as soon as that fuck, Andrew Stasić from school walked in I knew it was over.”

Q&A Nerds Spend 2 Hours Trying To Figure Out What Football Code Israel Folau Was Sacked From

TEXT:

Australian TV audiences were up past their bedtime last night watching yet another riveting edition of ABC’s Q&A – complete with nameless fringe-cabinet MPs from both the ALP and Liberal Party.

Once again the political class butted heads over weird culture wars issues that would never be two-sided unless they were debated by carefully selected panellists. Including one ‘people’s panellist’ who spent his 15 minutes of fame trying to validate the incel movement.

One issue that appeared to bring a rush of blood to the Minister For Education’s crotch was Israel Folau’s dismissal from Australian Rugby over using Instagram to promote religious homophobia.

Dan Tehan MP, took delight in positioning the Folau issue as evidence that Australia needs to take action on religious freedom, because as a lifelong public servant, this is the type of thing he thinks the average Australian cares about.

Prominent LGBTI activist Sally Rugg said Folau’s comments were fucked and probably not helping vulnerable and confused kids.

The panel then spent an necessary amount of time discussing the rights of a concussion-ridded ‘sportsball’ star who only really had roughly 18 months left in his athletic career anyway.

Between the inane audience applauses between each soundbite, one thing that became clear was that none of the nerds on the panel even know the difference between AFL, rugby league, or rugby union – including the people’s panellist, who came across as more of a indoor mountain climbing kinda guy.

After it became clear that Folau has played all three codes at some point in his career, the programming took a brief break while all members of the panel picked up their iPhones to google what sport they were actually talking about.

“Got it” said Labor MP Catherine King.

“Apparently he plays rugby union. Which I believe is similar to rugby league but mostly played by private schoolers and kiwis”

The entire room went silent, before an audience member raised their hand and posed the most important question of the evening.

“Why are we evening talking rugby union? Like, I don’t think Australia is even going to make it out of pool stages when we play Uruguay in the World Cup”

The questioner received a ten minute standing ovation before Tony Jones indicated that he will be taking it as a comment.

The capital of the aspiring Republic of Western Australia has today been flooded by hordes of people looking for the Where’s The Gold and More Chilli style machines. 

This comes after some cashed up New South Wales and Queensland Rugby League fans descend on Perth ahead of the 2nd State of Origin game tonight. 

With the pinnacle of the greatest game of all* taking place tonight, the people of the Eastern Seaboard have a few hours to kill. 

That has lead to thousands of blue and maroon clad league fans desperately looking for the VIP section’s of any of the local pubs. 

“Yeah Swan River’s alright,” said one nonchalant Sydneysider who lists the pokies as one of his major hobbies. 

“Apparently Cottesloe’s alright too, but I’ve got time and cash to burn,” 

“So I’m gonna clean out some machines,” explained the man already on his 4th Bundy and coke. 

It’s believed the influx of pokie machine revenue will be the largest hit to the economy since they discovered you could make a lot of money digging things out of the ground.

Israel Folau Takes Part In Ancient Christian Tradition Of Crowd-Funding His Own Salary

TEXT:

Multimillionaire contact sport player Israel Folau has today unveiled plans to raise a $3 million target to help cover his $150,000 to fight Rugby Australia over the termination of his contract.

After playing both NRL and AFL professional, Folau’s rugby union contract was discontinued in April over his controversial social media posts in which he posted that homosexuals, among others, would go to hell unless they repented.

Folau, a staunch Pentecostal Christian who converted from the Mormon church around about the time where most young men would have to sacrifice a year to go on missionary service, has today taken part in the age old Christian tradition of crowd-funding his own salary.

While usually a collection plate is used in this scenario, Izzy’s chosen denomination, the Assemblies Of God, now use a portable eft-pos machine to raise the money to pay their church figures to talk shit.

However, considering all of Folau’s money will eventually go back to the church, he’s decided to use an online crowd-funding platform to ask the greater population to chip in.

Earlier this month he announced he had launched legal proceedings with the Fair Work Commission against RA and NSW Rugby for breach of contract.

Folau, who was well-known for not acting like a Christian in Fortitude Valley during his time at the Brisbane Broncos has appointed a legal team comprised of high-profile employment lawyers, including barrister George Haros and barrister Stuart Wood AM QC.

In response to this most recent the Greater Western Sydney Giants fans have announced plans to crowd-fund the 4.2 million dollars he stole from their club to allegedly play AFL for three years,

Surfer Stuck At Work During Big Swell Rebels Against Societal Constructs By Doing Fuck All

TEXT:

A local surfer is sticking it to the man this morning after showing up to his day job, rather than chucking a sickie to surf the solid six-foot southerly swell rolling into Betoota’s Point Break – a rare occurrence that only happens once every ten years.

Blake Stokenson has taken revenge on his cafe employer by not doing any of the work he’s been assigned, a pointless but empowering fuck you to the man.

It’s believed that Blake is taking the situation particularly poorly because all of his friends are out ‘getting barrelled’ while he’s stuck at his job, which in itself is a sore point for him.

“It’s fucked, bro”

“Not only are they paying me out for missing out on the surf, but they’re gettin’ into me about having a job!”

Poor Blake was unfortunate enough to be forced into getting a job by his mum, who it’s believed was sick of him living in their Betoota Grove house rent free.

“I even asked my boss if I could have the day off to surf, he said no”

“So, to teach him a lesson I’m just not doing any work today, that’ll show him”

“I refuse to make a single coffee” 

The Advocate can confirm that Blake’s rebellion against basic societal constructs is not boding too well with his employer, who said that Blake is already on thin ice.

“He’s bloody useless. It’s not like him refusing to do work today is different to any other day, usually he just sits there on his phone watching surfing videos, so nothing gets done anyway.”

AFP Officers Treated For Severe Croc-Related Injuries After Attempting To Raid The NT News

TEXT:

Australian Federal Police officers have finally been released from Darwin hospital more than eight hours after a failed raid of the NT news over a series of 2017 stories known as the Dildo Files.

The stories, by NT investigative journalists revealed allegations of unlawfully sized dildo being sold in prominent Darwin sex shops and were based off hundreds of pages of secret Defence documents leaked to the NT News.

AFP officers served the NT News legal team with a warrant and searched for information related to the warrant.

The AFP officers took with them two USB drives containing a small number of electronic files, which were sealed in plastic bags pending a review by NT news lawyers.

However, before they were able to leave the premises, the Feds were accosted by several saltwater crocodiles at the entrance to the iconic Territorian media organ’s newsroom.

The officers were unable to leave the building with the documents in question, after losing the plastic bags of seized items to a death roll.

One officer is reportedly suffering from severe lacerations to his arsehole, with another nearly losing an ankle.

Representatives from PETA arrived on the scene to rescue the crocodiles, before berating the officers for feeding them plastic.

Link Established Between Winning Grand Slams And Not Carrying On Like A Fucking Pelican

TEXT:

In some breaking news out of the French capital of Paris overnight, it has been confirmed that there may be a link between not carrying on like a pelican and having success on the tennis court. 

This comes after Ash Barty stormed home to beat Czech Marketa Vondrousova 6-1, 6-3 in the final of the French Open, and win her first ever Grand Slam Singles Title (Ash already won a Doubles Slam Title in 2018). 

The incredible achievement for the likeable racquet and ball player comes only a couple of years after she gave up playing cricket as her primary sport, and caps off an inspirational rise to the top. 

Following her humble victory and acceptance of the trophy, Tennis Australia’s sports psychologists are now looking deeper into how much of a factor not carrying on like a galah on and off the tennis court played in her win and ascension into the elite echelons of the game. 

“Yeah, obviously it’s something we have to seriously look at now,” a spokesperson said regarding the tennis player whose repairing some of the damage done to the reputation of Ipswich. 

“We are still trying to figure out exactly how she can appear so likeable and inspirational on the court without having to have at least one blow up a tournament.” 

“Maybe it’s got something to do with the fact she enjoys playing the game and loves travelling around the world playing a sport she loves.” 

“We are looking into it, don’t worry.”

He then told us he had to end the interview and asked that we please don’t refer to her win as a ‘Barty Party’ in our headline.

Dutton Furiously Takes Notes During Last Night’s Return Of The Handmaid’s Tale

TEXT:

After a busy week, Home Affairs Minister and aspiring head of the future Ministry Of Truth, Peter Dutton spent last night furiously working away. 

The former cop from the Sunshine Coast didn’t eat his dinner until nearly midnight, after he spent hours watching and re-watching the newest episode of the hit show The Handmaids Tale on SBS.

Not normally a fan of this genre, Dutton skipped his routine watch of RBT Australia to meticulously watch the new season of the show. 

Following the week of raids by the AFP on journalists and news organisations in what looked like politically motivated raids to silence the 4th Estate, Dutton said he couldn’t miss the newest episode of the dystopian drama based in an authoritarian regime. 

Speaking to The Advocate this morning, Dutton explained that he religiously watches the show now. 

“Not for like the complex character portrayals or the gripping storyline, but  for the way Gilead functions,” he said. 

“And those flashbacks they do, fuck me there is some gold in there.” 

“Really really interesting to see how you can spiral a society down into authoritarianism so easily.” 

“That Commander Waterford, fuck me, what a man.” 

“Lots to learn.”

Dutton then explained to us that he’s tried to pester Tony Abbott into getting around the show plenty of times. 

“He’d love it, but he gets to into all the old English Period Dramas to much to give it a go.”

Prime Minister Assures Journalists If They Have A Go, They’ll Get A Go, In Prison Lol

TEXT:

Prime Minister Scott Morrison has today addressed claims by the media, and his election-weary opposition, that the Federal Government is responsible for the current flutter of AFP raids across the 4th Estate.

The Australian Federal Police raided the ABC’s offices in relation to a story on war crimes in Afghanistan on Wednesday, just one day after they raided News Corp journalist Annika Smethurst’s home over a story about a government plan to spy on ordinary Australians.

In less-human-rights-violationy news, they also raided The Betoota Advocate newsroom over the 1997 Engadine McDonalds leaks, as well as the Canberra Raiders NRL club over claims that they have stolen the AFP’s nickname.

However, Morrison has today downplayed the hysteria, claiming this isn’t the horrific Orwellian nightmare that everyone seems to think it is.

“First of all let me say that my government is absolutely committed to freedom of the press, secondly these are matters that were being pursued by the AFP, who are, like, good mates, but not kick-down-a-door-for-ya type mates”

Mr Morrison said he understood the raids have caused anxiety from the press and more broadly, but he said there’s nothing really to worry about, unless you’ve got something to worry about.

“Should keep you lot on your toes [haha]” said Morrison.

“But seriously”

“I stand by my party’s ethos…”

“To the increasingly nervous journalist out there, if you wanna have a go, you’ll get a go”

“In prison lmao”

Referees Association Raided By AFP Over Whistleblowing

TEXT:

NRL Headquarters in Sydney has been turned upside down this afternoon as the latest Australian Federal Police raid takes place. 

This comes after the AFP raided the ABC and NewsCorp in what seemed very much like a politically motivated attempt to silence journalists and news organisations. 

Carrying out further raids across the country, it can be confirmed that the Feds have just hit the Referees Association offices this afternoon. 

It’s believed that the raids on the referees are targeted attacks on our nation’s most high profile whistleblowers. 

Prime Minister Scott Morrison has denied any knowledge of the raids prior to the news breaking a short time ago but refused to explain why Matt Cecchin and Ashley Klein ( the two officials in charge of the Sharks most recent loss) were arrested and taken away in a black van. 

“I’ve got no idea what’s happened to those two referees. But I do know that no one is above the law, not even referees whose eyes are painted on.” 

An AFP spokesperson told us a moment ago that they cannot give out any information regarding the two referees and the raid in detail. 

“Look, what we will say, is that a pretty clear precedent has been set. Whistleblowers in this country are on high alert now.” 

“We’ve been told that people who want to think they can go and get all uppity and blow the whistle on things that the government maybe shouldn’t be doing are going to pay the price.” 

“The people can trust us, and that’s why we don’t need to be held to account.”

AFP Headquarters Erupts Into Laughter After Someone Suggests Raiding A Current Affair

TEXT:

Staff at the Australian Federal Police have today been treated to a little moment of comic relief,  taking their minds off carrying out what arguably appears to be politically motivated raids on news organs. 

After hitting the ABC and NewsCorp over the last couple of days in something that looks an awful lot like an attack on democracy and the freedom of journalists to hold those in power to account, the AFP is currently deciding what to do next. 

With raids just carried out on Bathurst and the Canberra Raiders, someone at the organisation then ludicrously suggested raiding A Current Affair.

The suggestion from a junior in the ranks set the entire department into rapture. 

“[Ah ha ha] I think he’s being serious, Raid A Current Affair, you want us to spring a surprise on Daily Mail too,” laughed an old detective uncontrollably. 

After a short period of laughter all round, another detective wiped the tears from his eyes before saying; “Ah that’s good. All those whistleblowers calling out dodgy tradies and milk powder shoppers ‘threatening national security.'”

“You may actually be on to something there though.” 

“Nine owns Fairfax now.” 

“And they still report on some stuff that portrays the government and national security in a bad light, so maybe we should actually pay them a visit.” 

“Just to let them know they shouldn’t be getting an ideas.”

Recently Single Woman Sounds War Horn Assembling Girls To Help Curate Bumble Profile

Chaotic scenes unfolded on the Betoota Esplanade this afternoon after Eva Yilman (25) sounded her war-horn, disrupting everyone in the popular beachside restaurant that she and her girls were lunching at.

“You guys, I need help!”

“What photo’s do I put on my Bumble profile?”

After a quick and precise study of Eva’s temporary profile, the girls began firing off suggestions of how to make Eva’s profile unswipable.

“Oh, babe, what’s the go with this outdoorsy image?” questioned Jenny. 

“You don’t look that hot in it and it’s not even a fun scenario, I would lose immediately” she continued, before losing herself in an Instagram stalk of Eva, fervently trying to find a replacement image.

“Babe, this one” added another friend, Sarah, who’d already scoured Eva’s Instagram feed. 

Sarah’s comment was met with a chorus of agreeance from the other girls.

It’s believed the intensity and hysteria of the scenario was exacerbated by the multiple Aperol Spritz and bottles of rose that the girls had consumed over their already 2-hour long lunch.

With only one, maybe two, of Eva’s profile photos selected, it’s not yet known how much longer it will be until Eva’s profile is live.

New Aussie Film Slammed For Failing To Include At Least One Heroin Addict In Storyline

TEXT:

A highly anticipated Australian film has been slammed this morning after it’s premiere last night. 

The film titled Little Dog, starring Ben Mendelsohn, Hugo Weaving and Rose Byrne had been looked about as a potential blockbuster but has been criticised for one glaring mistake. 

Everyone involved with the making of the film on the Gold Coast is under fire after their failure to include at least one character with a crippling heroin addiction. 

“I’ve got absolutely no idea what they were thinking,” explained leading film critic at Fairfax David Pomeranz. 

“Obviously they’ve all missed the memo, if you haven’t got Hugh Jackman in it, make it bleak film noir.” 

“I mean, I came out of this film feeling uplifted, bubbly and in good spirits. You should come away from an Australian film feeling flatter that a Tuesday morning work commute after a scat weekend.” 

Pomeranz said their were other problems with the film’s story line. 

“Not a single problematic uncle figure lurking around.” 

“And Ben (Mendolsohn) plays a fucking happy go lucky marketing executive. Jesus Christ.” 

“Not even a coke problem.”

Despite the criticism from film critics and movie buffs, the film has seemingly done well across the country after it’s release last night.

Geoffrey Rush Avenges Nation’s Lefties By Humiliating News Corp, Young Women

TEXT:

Following last weekend’s shocking election result, pearl clutching lefties across the country were given even more reason to hate the Murdoch Empire.

Not only had News Corp spent the last two years working day and night to besmirch the good name of their dear Geoffrey Rush, but they also utilised their 70% national media marketshare to shoe-horn another Morrison government back into power.

The latter of course, being the true travesty. Because as anyone who earns enough money to live in the inner-city and still vote for the Greens knows, Geoffrey Rush is innocent of the accusations made against him by uppity little princesses who were just trying to make a name for themselves in the lucrative business of stage theatre.

However, the shattered left-wing voters of Australia can today at least find solace in the small mercies. With the darling Geoffrey holding the establishment to account for their lying ways.

In a reported landmark win, Geoffrey Rush has been awarded $2.9 million in his defamation case against News Corp, owned by Rupert Murdoch. The largest payout to a single person in Australian history. After months of court proceedings and a number young women being once again humiliated both in person and on the record by Geoffrey’s elite criminal barristers.

The initial ruling was handed down by an old leathery judge who looks about Geoffrey’s age, and also looks like he loved the movie Shine, decided an alleged female victim of Geoffrey Rush’s alleged misconduct, was taking a few liberties in saying that she felt creeped out by him, from her perspective, and therefore the newspaper was wrong to say he was a creep.

These revelations are welcomed by the nation’s inner-city elite, who only have time for the #MeToo movement when it involves low-brow media figures like Don Burke. 

“These allegations are very serious. I think we should be very careful before we condemn him” says one Balmain resident, Bronte Drummoyne (33).

“It’s not like he’s an NRL player… The Daily Telegraph can’t just go around writing things like that about people like our Geoffrey”

“Personally, I think this is great news. At least Our Geoffrey had a win against the brutish News Corp”

“It almost feels as though Bill Shorten didn’t lose the election by record-breaking swing against the Labor Party.”

Another staunch lover of films and the ABC, West End-based lino-printer Wyatt Elight (44) says he’s glad Geoffrey got his day in court. Against the villianous News Corp empire, no less.

“Who would have known the pay-out you get from being wrongly portrayed as a sexual deviant would be more than any victim of sexual assault has ever received”

“Thanks to Geoffrey, we have the last laugh!”

“David has finally slain Goliath”

“I’m Moving To New Zealand” Says Shattered Leftie Who’s Sick Of The Dumb Rugby-Loving Farmers

A young woman from Betoota’s French Quarter, our little slice of Fitzroy in the Diamantina, has today confirmed that she is ‘literally’ moving to New Zealand. 

Lara Leigh-Anderson (27) says the surprise decision comes after the ‘shocking’ news from the weekend, which saw the state of Queensland crush Labor’s hopes of claiming government.

“No literally, I’m actually done,” explained the community lawyer employed by a government-funded organisation.

“Legit, this country is full of dumb working class peasants who don’t understand what’s best for them,” she explained. 

“Urgh, I can’t believe Queensland.” 

Leigh-Anderson told The Advocate that she’s moving to a more progressive country that ‘actually has a conscience.’

“I’m moving to New Zealand,” explained the young woman who detests organised sport.

“I’m just hoping there is a cafe where I move that knows how to infuse turmeric into a latte properly.” 

The tertiary educated, upper middle class raised French Quarter local says she’s just had it up to her with ‘stupid footy loving farmers.’

“I’m hoping New Zealand is going to be completely different,” she said.

“I don’t know why you are looking at me,” said Albo brushing a leaf of his Milanese suit. 

“I mean, maybe Tanya should consider her stance on the leadership, but I’ve got no idea how that horses head ended up in her little terrace house.” 

“Something to think about I guess.”

“Anyway, while I’ve got you hear, I wish to make it known that I am the man who can unite the divided families of this party.”

Newspoll Predict Parramatta To Comfortably Win The NRL Premiership

The often referenced Newspoll organisation has today double down on its bold predictions. 

After getting the outcome of the federal election incredibly wrong, the polling company has decided to predict another outcome that won’t happen and tipped Parramatta to win the NRL Premiership in a few months time. 

This comes after the polls got it wrong again on the federal election, following the notable fuck-ups that were the NSW State Election, Brexit and Donald Trump’s barnstorming run to the White House. 

Following their predictions on the federal election, that went as poorly as a problem gambler’s 13 leg multi, Newspoll said they are happy to go out on a limb and call the likely result of rugby league competition. 

“Yeah, we’ve been crunching the numbers, and given us polling companies have made a habit of getting things incredibly wrong over the last few years, we’ve decided to tip the Blue and Gold,” a spokesperson laughed. 

“It’s probably a bit mean to their fans I guess,” he laughed. 

“Giving them false hope and all, but they are that delusional every year that I don’t think it’s going to matter really.” 

“The biggest risk is that Nathan Hindmarsh will try and come out of retirement in a desperate and final bid to win a Premiership ring.” 

“But anyway, yep, that’s our offical prediction for this years competition and we look forward to being proven incredibly wrong a few months down the track.” 

“Oh and we reckon Carlton’s gonna win the AFL,” he laughed.

After what can only be described as one of the most horrendous bedshits in living memory, heavyweights within the party have decided to hire some forensics to try and clean up the appalling mess. 

In what looks like an example of what would happen if someone who had just had an Indian Banquet and 11 Crownies got a bout of gastro during their sleep, the party is desperately trying to figure out how they shit the bed so badly. 

With the stench from the faeces indicating it may have something to do with a leader who has been unpopular for years, it now looks like the cleaners and the party will have some time to clean up the disgusting mess and reassess where they are at with a long spell on the sidelines ahead. 

Speaking to the Advocate briefly from inside their HAZMAT suit outside the Labor party headquarters, one of the cleaners explained they hadn’t seen a mess this bad since the Engadine Maccas Incident in 1997. 

“Yeah, I was on the scene for the Michael Daley incident earlier this year, and that was nothing compared to this,” he said. 

“Fuck, obviously all the ignoring of the leader’s unpopularity is part of the mess, and then there’s a failure to explain their policies, as well as the Murdoch empire’s power and the Australian voters desire to ensure they benefit as much as financially possible, or are in the position to benefit as much as financially possible from the Liberal’s policies if they ever progress from the working class to the middle class and upper class.” 

“Anyway, we’ve got a lot of work to do, so I best be off,” said the cleaner trudging off into the disgusting scene.

Nation Mourns Last Prime Minister Who Didn’t Look Like He Hated Every Beer Handed To Him

TEXT:

The nation is mourning the death of Australia’s 23rd prime minister Bob Hawke, who died yesterday aged 89.

The final day of the 2019 election campaign seems been overshadowed by the death of the last universally loved character of Australian politics, with tributes continuing to pour in for the last Prime Minister who who actually didn’t look like he was being forced to drink beer to impress the plebs.

While those close to Hawke say that he really, really did love a schooner – to the point where he had to go schooner-free for most of his time as an elected member of Parliament – it seems that even as a teetotaller, Hawke was more convincing inside a pub than anyone to follow him.

Current Prime Minister Scott Morrison has visibly hated ever beer handed to him, possibly due to his staunch pentecostal faith that actually detests drunkards. 

Julia Gillard never really looked like she enjoyed a beer, but was much more convincing than Kevin Rudd, who looks like he’d be more comfortably putting away a tall glass of choccie milk.

While rumours have for years circulated about Former Prime Minister Tony Abbott actually drinking shandies because he is too much of a lightweight for his staffers to trust him with one full standard drink at a time – Turnbull has outwardly declared himself more of ‘pinot grigio’ kinda guy.

The death of Mr Hawke also marks loss of one of the last Prime Ministers who went to the cricket because he actually enjoyed cricket – now leaving John ‘The Rainman’ Howard as the last PM who would be able to name the entire Australian side if you asked him.

The Betoota Advocate remembers Bob Hawke as a kind man and an eccentric personality that we could rely on for a sound bite. He was the last sitting Prime Minister to actually visit our town, during a brief Opal Rush in the mid 1980s.

Local Man Stages Coup Against Girlfriend After She Bans Kick-Ons In Their Apartment

TEXT:

Local crane operator, Todd Harrison, has today committed his mind to something for the first time since his year 10 exams. 

The sudden need for cognitive power has come after his girlfriend declared their apartment a kick-on free zone.

It’s believed the ban was implemented after Clare, Todd’s girlfriend, was woken at 2:30 am for the fifth Saturday in a row by Todd and his extremely intoxicated friends. 

So, while Clare’s reaction may seem justified, Todd is having flashbacks to high school history. 

“First this, then what?”

“It’s only a matter of time before she bans me from going out all together!” cried a desperate Todd to his riled-up friends. 

Reports from the scene indicate that Todd and his friends proceeded to drink at the West Betoota establishment until it closed, allegedly taking regular trips to the bathroom in pairs prior to closure.

Once on the street Todd could be heard slurring “Fuck it! It’s half my apartment too, she can’t stop me from doing anything!”

The last time the men were seen was stumbling up to Todd’s apartment at around 2:00am.

It’s not yet known what the consequences for disobeying Clare’s direct orders are, but considering she makes them wear couple’s pyjamas we fear it may be serious.

Surprisingly Small List Of Damages To AirBNB On Bucks Weekend More Than Budgeted For In Bond

A wave of disappointment has washed over a group of mates this morning after the damages bill came in from the Air BNB they had a bucks party at over the weekend. 

Jack Simmons, the organiser of the event, messaged the group of men to tell them the bad news. 

“Fuck, we put on a clinic and the bill is only $1000.” 

“Between us its like $50 bucks each” 

“It’s kind of disappointing” replied one of the boys. 

“It’s like we didn’t have a go at all” added another. 

While the sentiment in the group is disappointment, The Advocate can reveal that the owners of the Air BnB are experiencing rage. 

“They completely trashed the place!” The owner told our reporter.

“There was shit all over the sheets, I presume someone shat themselves” 

“Then there was broken glass everywhere, half drunk beers left in the shower, the place was an absolute disgrace” 

“I’ll be leaving a very honest review on Jack Simmons’ account” 

Upon telling Jack about the negative review the host had left he just laughed. 

“Haha, yeah I’d already assumed that would happen – I treated this booking like it was my last anyway” 

“Words can’t hurt, if they wanted to teach me a lesson they should have charged me.” 

Unfortunately for AirBNB hosts, groups holding bucks parties and other house parties is only on the rise.

In Betoota there’s a growing trend of ghost hosts renting out homes purely to hold house parties there, rather than trashing their own homes.

It’s believe the hosts are approaching AirBNB for solutions.

In a news cycle dominated by climate policy and aged care, Peter Dutton has tried to pull a sneaky one by unsuccessfully stoking the fires of racial friction by excessive use of the word ‘boats’.

“”Duhhh, ummm, duhh borders” said Peter Dutton, in a bold attack on Labor’s policy regarding arguably made-up boats.

This comes a couple weeks after Dutton’s last run at the headlines, where he  unveiled the bold campaign strategy of berating disabled people in an effort to win over the support of voters in his marginal seat of Herbert, north of Brisbane.

The issue of border protection had barely rated a mention during the election campaign before his comments, and still isn’t really an election issue, unless we want to talk about the boatload of Vietnamese blokes who somehow ended up in the Daintree.

These comments mark the final days of of Dutton’s 18-year reign as the Member For Dickson, in which time he appears to have worked his very hardest to become Prime Minister even if it means throwing a hospital pass to Scott Morrison.

With Labor paying $1.60 to take the seat from Dutton, it is not known if the outgoing member for Dickson is going to find much work in the private sector after proving he is capable of fucking up a cup of coffee.

However, it is believed that Dutton is not too concerned about employment after politics – given all of the money his family’s childcare centres have made out of this current government.

Gen X Leftie Brought To Orgasm During Mid Afternoon Paul Keating YouTube Session

TEXT:

A local Volvo and Sex Pistols enthusiast has today had to run to the bathroom in a hurry. 

The scurry out of the open plan marketing agency came after the Gen X leftie decided to treat himself to a spontaneous mid-afternoon Paul Keating YouTube session. 

Aldous Peters spoke to The Advocate a short time ago after he’d successfully managed to flush his underwear down the toilet following a 5-minute shift trying to dispose of the sullied garment. 

“Geez, I won’t be doing that again in public,” said the free-balling self-described free spirit washing his hands. 

“I thought I’d treat some of the millennials in our office to some real political discourse,” said the man who affectionately refers to the former PM as PJK. 

“And I got the blood rush when he referred to John Howard as a little desiccated coconut” 

“And then unfortunately mid-way through the line about debating John Hewson being equivalent to getting flogged with wet lettuce, I nutted.” 

Shaking his head and splashing his face with water, Peters then told us he hopes he doesn’t get a talking to from HR. 

“I should have walked away, but that razor-sharp wit, that intellect, that charisma, I’m just a deer in the headlights.”

Australian Enjoying Overseas Holiday Finds Self Ill-Equipped To Party Past Midnight

TEXT:

Local man, Tyler Waters, had a sting that would kill a small child as he began his holiday in the United States of America, however on his first night on the town in Chicago he has found himself completely out of his depth and asking for his mother. 

“What is this place?” 

“What time do the lock out laws come in?” he asked his American friend, praying it was sometime soon. 

Unfortunately for Tyler, no lock out laws we’re going to save him, he had no choice but continue to stay out and drink. 

Reports from the scene are not pretty.

According to multiple witnesses, Tyler was an absolute mess and completely ill-equipped to handle a full night on the piss. 

On multiple occasions he had to go to the bathroom and vomit and it’s believed he even tried to fight a father of three who looked at him ‘the wrong way’. 

The Advocate reached out to Tyler the morning after his debaucherous night to see how he was feeling and whether or not he had quenched his sting. 

“Yeah, definitely.”

“Man, I can’t handle it over here. Free pouring should be illegal, what is that shit?” 

“I never thought I’d say this, but I’m kind of happy that we have lock out laws and responsible service of alcoholic, I’m not cut out for this man.” 

With 3 more weeks of his holiday ahead of him, Tyler said he will just try and do the best he can.

Report: Best Way To Distinguish Hipster From Homeless Person is Apple AirPods

TEXT:

A new report from Australia’s leading scientific body, the CSIRO, has today solved a problem that has plagued Betootans for the past ten years.

The year-long study looked into how to tell the difference between hipsters and homeless people and found that the best way to distinguish between the two is the use of Apple AirPods.

“It’s really very exciting” Dr. Tim Wheeler told the Advocate.

“Ever since being a hipster became a thing people have had trouble knowing whether the person chose to dress themselves scrappily or if their circumstances meant they had to”

“Now we can just tell, almost immediately.”

Dr. Wheeler has been the lead researcher of the CSIRO’s cultural division for over 5 years, having previously looked into social issues like why white girls go crazy on rosé, whether it’s possible for a vegan to be vegan without telling someone and more recently, whether wearing sunnies on the back of your neck makes you more of a psycho.

Following our interview with Dr. Wheeler, The Advocate hit the streets to test the latest theory. 

Within 10 minutes we were able to successfully identify 3 hipsters and 5 homeless people, proving that Dr. Wheeler’s research is accurate.

The full impact of the report is not yet known, but based off our quick test we suspect it’ll be immensely helpful.

Woman At Airport Suddenly Unsure What Happened To The Bag Of Gear She Bought A Year Ago

TEXT:

Fear has turned the blood of a young Betoota woman cold today as she waits in line at Betoota International Airport. 

While she hasn’t got a criminal record and has literally nothing to worry about, a bag of cocaine she bought over a year ago has suddenly popped into mind.

“What happened to that bag?” Alana Styles frantically wondered to herself.

The Advocate has it on good authority that Alana and her friends finished the bag in question on the night they purchased it, however, that fact seems to have escaped Alana as she grows increasingly anxious in the line at security.

Not wanting to draw attention to herself, even though as a young white woman she didn’t draw attention in the first place, Alana subtly opened her wallet and checked every slip and crevice.

“Phew” she thought.

Despite not finding the bag anywhere in her wallet, Alana still walked through security praying to god that she didn’t get pulled up. 

Reports from the airport say that she was heard saying “woohoo” to herself after she got through.

Katter Candidate Resigns As Social Media Posts Emerge Of Him Working As A Barista In West End

TEXT:

The Katter Australian Party candidate for the seat of Yawannagokunt North-West of Brisbane, has withdrawn after social media posts came to light that showed him once working in an inner-city cafe.

Luke Hardt-Kennedy (35) a prominent rifle range supervisor and former Mackay Cutters superstar, has admitted to the allegations, stating that he needed to find some work while awaiting an ill-fated contract with the Broncos.

In a statement released by the KAP, Mr Hardt-Kennedy said the photos did not reflect his views today but that his actions were “an important lesson for young people that your social media footprint will follow you”.

“It is clear the right thing for me to do is stand down,” the statement said.

“While I surrounded myself with those entitled, close-minded, people in West End many years ago and they in no way reflect the views I hold today, I understand, especially as a member of the Katter Party, that we need to be careful about what we share or like on social media.”

KAP Leader, The Honourable Bob Katter III says the images make him sick to the stomach.

“I’m glad Susie took the keys to my gun safe from me” said the ropeable Member For Kennedy.

“The fact that this man has, at some point in his life, associated with residents of Boundary street, is in excusable. “

“And I’m not talking about the Greeks or the Blackfellas… Or even the old Magpies players of West End. I’m talking full blown white boys with dreadlocks”

“Luke Hardt-Kennedy is dead to me. He’s been ordered to hand over his Akubra and Adler shotgun immediately.”

“And I thought recruiting Fraser Anning was a bad call. Glad I dodged that bullet”

Labor To Utilise Famous Tony Abbott Response For Any Questions On Adani Going Forward

TEXT:

In a somewhat odd turn of events, the Australian Labor Party has confirmed today that they will be borrowing a media technique from Tony Abbott. 

While they won’t be defending and referring to convicted pedophiles as close personal friends, all Federal Labor Members, Senators and candidates have been told to borrow the old Tony Abbott head shake and say nothing response to questions you don’t want to answer. 

The technique was first developed by Abbott in 2011 when being interviewed by Channel 7’s Mark Riley. 

Facing some tough questions, Abbott decided to simply zip his lips, shake his head and remain mute for a period of time, prompting the famous ‘You’re not saying anything Tony,’ prodding from Riley.

In the wake of Bill Shorten’s interview with Leigh Sales last night, and the fast moving front wheel of a pushbike into a deep pothole that was the Cathy O’Toole interview this morning, the Labor party have informed everyone to adopt the ‘Abbott shake’ anytime they face questions on Adani. 

“We are desperately trying to get through these next couple of weeks without offering an actual position on one of the greatest ever desecrations of the country’s environment, and so anytime we get asked about it we are going to just sit there awkwardly until the reporter moves on,” said a Labor insider. 

“It’s not worth risking anything by actually offering a stance on something that could jeopardise votes in crucial seats in Queensland if you know what I mean.” 

“Ultimately, it doesn’t matter if the whole mine is as short sighted as pensioner without glasses, we’ve got any election to win.”

One Nation Adds New Dot-Point To Their Vetting Process For Potential Candidates

TEXT:

As of today, One Nation will be adding a third dot-point to their thorough background checks for potential political candidates, which previously had only required answers to whether or not they had ever killed anyone or harboured the sufficient hatred for Muslims and Africans.

One Nation Senate candidate for Queensland Steve Dickson has resigned after footage was released of him making derogatory comments and touching a dancer in a US strip club. Mr Dickson said in a statement he apologised sincerely for his behaviour, before resigning, stating that he’s realised you can’t come back from something this fucking embarrassing.

The vision was recorded during an undercover investigation by Al Jazeera but aired for the first time by Nine’s A Current Affair on Monday.

It was filmed as part of the same operation which last month revealed Mr Dickson and party advisor James Ashby travelled to the US last year seeking millions of dollars in foreign donations from lobby groups like the National Rifle Association (NRA).

The newly released recordings showed Mr Dickson talking disparagingly about the dancers with fellow patrons.

He refers to one dancer as a “bitch” and says of another: “Little tits, nothing there.”

Mr Dickson is also filmed as saying: ” I think white women fuck a whole lot better, they know what they’re doing. Asian chicks don’t.

“I’ve done more Asian than I know what to do with.”

Another segment shows him talking with a dancer after slipping money into her lingerie.

“You need to slide your hand on my cock” he says to the dancer.

“Right now?” she asks.

“Yeah absolutely,” he responds.

She declines, saying: “I can’t do that sorry, they’ll probably notice.”

In his statement today, Dickson said he was deeply remorseful for his “disrespectful comments towards women”.

One Nation leader Pauline Hanson said she has accepted Mr Dickson’s resignation, and has made moves to immediately update the Far-Right Parties thorough vetting process.

“I’m upset with this, Steve is a family man … I’m sorry he is deeply upset by this I’m not going to judge him any further.”

The new background check for candidates now includes a question asking potential candidates if they are “unlikely to get fucken blind in a US strip club while groping and then soliciting their employees to suck me off for cash, before openly admitting to a stranger that I frequently root Asian sex workers despite being married”

“It’s necessary” said Hanson, who lost all four of her senate candidates to citizenship scandals and dissent within 18 months of the last election.

“I’m also in half a mind to check their likelihood of allowing an undercover journalist to follow them for an entire year with a hidden camera”

Rural Dad Leans Into The Cultural Experience And Asks For Sweet Chilli sauce At Chinese

TEXT:

Rodney Smyth has pushed himself out of his culinary comfort zone at Mr Ling’s Chinese restaurant this evening after asking the waiter if they had any of their traditional spicy sauce.

It’s believed his cultured children rolled their eyes, knowing full well that he meant sweet chilli sauce and that it was not traditionally Chinese.

“When in Rome, hey kids” Rodney said.

Rodney, sad his staple foods are meat and three veg for dinner and a bowl of wheat bix for breakfast. 

“Phhwwoar!”

“That’s got a bit of a kick to it!”

“Is this from your home country?” He asked the waiter.

“Umm, no, we just get it delivered wholesale from Coles, you can buy it too” said the second generation Australian.

Sweet chilli sauce, also known as nam chim kai in Thailand (Thai: น้ำจิ้มไก่; literally “dipping sauce for chicken”), is a popular chilli sauce condiment in Thai, Afghan, Malaysian, and Western cuisine. 

It’s believed the kids didn’t want to derail Rodney’s culinary exploration so they refrained from telling him that Sweet Chilli Sauce is actually a product of Thailand. 

At the time of press, Rodney had just ordered another serving of his favourite dish, sweet and sour pork.

Selfish Piece Of Shit Reclines In Cattle Class

“Is this guy for real?” Lucy Beach uttered to herself after the man in the seat in front of her put his seat back as soon as the fasten seat-belt sign went off. 

While the dickhead in 12C isn’t breaking any real aviation laws, it’s the unwritten code of flying that he’s just broken.

Now, not only does Lucy have even less of her already minimal seat space, but she’s forced to put her own seat back – infringing on the personal space of the passenger behind, in turn creating a chain reaction through the whole plane.

The Advocate made contact with Lucy onboard the Airbus A380 by calling in a favour with the pilot of their Betoota to Hong Kong flight.

“How selfish do you have to be?” she asked.

“I bet he’s also the kind of guy who drinks the last of the milk and puts the empty carton back in the fridge.”

“I mean, this is an 11-hour flight, surely he could just watch movies or something upright until after dinner’s served?” Lucy continued.

Wanting to know more about airway etiquette, The Advocate reached out June Daly-Watkins, undoubtedly the authority on social etiquette since the 1950s.

“Ms. Bendinger, it is the height of rudeness. Airway Etiquette rule #87 clearly states that should you need to put your seat back, you must wait until after the meal is served. Should there not be a meal, you must wait until at least one hour into the flight.”

“I’m disgusted by this man’s behaviour.”

With 10 hours left on her flight, it’s believed Lucy has turned to self-medicating with 3 Valium in hopes of being unconscious for the majority of the trip.

Lactose Intolerant Man Throws Caution To The Wind And Dives Into Freezer At Corner Store

TEXT:

A local man with a sensitive little belly has allowed the little devil on his shoulder to talk him into doing something he really shouldn’t today. 

The 20-something engineer from Betoota Heights named Levi Davis did so down at his local corner store today, blocking out the voice of reason and the voice of his girlfriend. 

Davis did so when he decided to treat himself to a little creamy treat, ignoring the fact that he knows his body can’t handle it. 

“Let’s see,” said the lactose intolerant man picking out an ice-cream and pretending that his intolerance had packed up shop and left overnight, allowing him to enjoy milky goodies for the rest of his day. 

“I’m craving a Maxibon,” he said fishing out the ice-cream against the pleas of his girlfriend who was well aware of what comes next. 

“Please don’t Levi,” said his girlfriend Mischa Little. 

“Just get a fruity one, or something without milk please,” she begged. 

Ignoring his sensible significant other and ploughing on, Davis spoke to us out the front of the corner store in the Heights as he chomped through the Maxibon that was about to put him all sorts. 

“Nah, I haven’t had one for ages, I might be okay,” lied Davis to us, as his girlfriend shook her head. 

He then plodded off down the street as his girlfriend explained why she was dreading the next few hours. 

“See how he is walking away now,” she sighed. 

“He’s going to be running in about 2 minutes, as that lactose runs through his body like a 100 kilo Polynesian ten-year-old through a local footy comp.” 

“I wouldn’t care what he subjects his body too if I didn’t have to live with him.” 

“I have to share a bathroom with Levi after he swallows that creamy hand grenade.” 

Little explained that her boyfriend might have a short memory, but she doesn’t. 

“A couple of weeks ago he ate a whole serving of Butter Chicken after he promised he wouldn’t order anything milky at the local Indian Restaurant.” 

“I had to go and sleep on the couch that night.” 

“Hopefully this time the ice cream sandwich just rips through him quickly and does drag on into the night.” 

Little then left and followed her boyfriend who was walking fairly briskly when we drove past him.

Paris Locals Say They Knew It Was A Bad Idea To Sell Notre Dame To An Outback QLD Publican

TEXT:

The iconic Notre Dame cathedral has been significantly damaged in a fire that has ripped through its roof and spire but the priceless collection of artwork inside has been recovered and authorities say the structure has been saved from total destruction.

The iconic Parisian tourists attraction was engulfed in flames just after it closed for the day. One fire fighter has been injured.

Paris locals say they are heartbroken, but not surprised.

“We said this when the 850-year old venue was sold last year” says President Emmanuel Macron.

“Why didn’t they just give it to a museum to look after, it’s a heritage listed building”

However, as Emmanuel Macron points out – for a building as delicate and timber-laden as the Notre Dame Cathedral – it was sold to possibly the most reckless type of owner there is.

A Western Queensland pub baron.

Bruce McEnroe (69), originally from Winton, surprised everyone in the back country last year when it was announced he’d taken his pub enterprise offshore, and nabbed the iconic Catholic Cathedral for an undisclosed amount.

However, as the Paris locals have pointed out in the aftermath of last night’s fire, they always knew McEnroe’s time as the owner operator of Notre-Dame was going to end badly.

“There was whispers that he’d done his arse” says local police chief Christoph Matilda (77).

“He’d struggled to get his DA approved for a woodfire pizza oven in the garden and a TAB on the ground floor”

“I know he was particularly offended when the Paris City Council wouldn’t allow him to bring pokies into the pub”

“Next thing you know, the whole fucking thing burns down and he’s filed an insurance claim within minutes of the roof caving in”

Investigators are now looking into whether or not last night’s disastrous fire was in fact an ‘Irish stocktake’ – and whether or not McEnroe’s impulsive holiday to Mooloolaba with the wife is actually legitimate.

The fact that all of McEnroe’s State Of Origin merchandise had been removed from the walls of Notre Dame before the fire has also raised suspicion.

Mainstream Brewery Gives Out Free Hat They Hope Will Become Ironically Cool In 20 Years

A marketing executive at mainstream brewery “Boggs” has been labelled as a marketing genius after they made the call to give away a free hat with the purchase of a $48 case of beer.

In order to engage better with their market of alcoholic baby boomers, Boggs marketing executive Tom Hanslow (30) made the decision to include a sweatshop baseball cap with the Boggs logo affixed to the front of it.

“We are aware that no one is going to wear this hat who doesn’t own 4 plus investment properties,” stated Hanslow.

“But in 20 years time, some hipsters are going to stab each other just to be seen wearing one of these ironically at one of their kombucha listening parties.”

“I also saw a park dad with an upmarket pram wearing one. Hipsters will be on it sooner than you think.”

Scientists Release First Ever Image Of Federal Government’s Balance Sheet For NBN Roll-Out

TEXT:

In some exciting news for the science world, the first ever image of a black hole has been captured today. 

The incredible scientific breakthrough which has finally proven beyond doubt that black holes exist was released today by the Event Horizon Telescope team. 

The image which dropped this morning was an exclusive shot of the NBN Co’s Balance Sheet for the project’s rollout, captured by the extremely powerful and expensive telescopes from the US. 

“It’s been a huge effort from all of the team to capture the document from a project set to be finished some light years away,” said the Chief Scientist Jai Antnerd. 

“We were able to confirm that it was, in fact, the first image of a blackhole after seeing the 52 billion dollars that is being sunk into the project that was torpedoed by Rupert Murdoch.” 

“Like Einstein and Hawking hypothesised this black hole is so powerful, that things like billions of dollars cannot escape the gravitational pull of the spacetime region.”

The scientist explained that everyone was ecstatic at the finding and explained that it’s another giant leap forward in science, astrophysics, and astronomy. 

“It’s going to take us quiet some time to figure out how exactly this black hole works, and we will be using the telescopes to examine things like how random companies are getting outrageously overpriced contracts and blokes are racking up small fortunes from hyper inflated wages.” 

“Today we celebrate, but tomorrow it’s all back to work.”

Aliens Bypass Earth After Learning About CrossFit

Extra-terrestrial researchers had their life’s ambition ripped away from them at the last minute today after an unidentified flying object heading for Earth chucked a u-ey at the last minute. 

Reports from the secret research lab outside Betoota indicate that the researchers are devastated and can’t for the life of them figure out what could have caused the change of mind. 

While it’s a mystery to the researchers, The Advocate can exclusively confirm the exact reason the aliens bypassed Earth. 

A warning, this news will frustrate some readers. 

“Siannny hgyshh alllaalili CrossFit” said Lord Vulton, leader of the Draxian creatures. 

For readers not fluent in Draxian, Lord Vulton said he got one glimpse of those Earthlings being fuckwits and that was enough to make him turn the ship around. 

He also went on to say that it was a shame because other Earthlings had been trying so hard to make contact and the Crossfitters ruined it for everyone.

The reporter at our intergalactic outpost pressed Lord Vulton for more detail on what exactly it was that deterred him.

“Jalalaahh? Jghu? Wilam plauplau!” which translates to “where do I start? Have you seen the way they do pull ups? It’s fucked!”

The Advocate is still tossing up whether to relay this information to the researchers or not, we’re erring on the side of not because rumour has it they’ve got a laser beam that could easily incinerate ten CrossFit gyms at once.

Nightwatchman Refuses To Grant Assange Refuge After WikiLeaks Blows Whistle On Engadine Maccas

The nation’s Nightwatchman has today officially ruled out taking Julian Assange in from the London cold. 

While commentators expected this would be the case, Scott Morrison did confirm the fact that Australia wouldn’t offer any assistance to the Wikileaks founder who is set to be turfed out of the Ecuadorian Embassy today and arrested. 

Assange’s expulsion from the Embassy comes after he bit two or three of the fingers off the hand that feeds him, with Wikileaks leaking documents about the Ecuadorian President alleging corruption. 

With some from the Far North hoping one of their prodigal sons might be able to return home, the nation’s Prime Minister has completely ruled out any homecoming after revealing that the boy from Townsville was behind the initial allegations surrounding the infamous 1997 Post Super League Grand Final Engadine Maccas Incident. 

“I’m absolutely not talking about anything from 1997, unless you wanna talk about Pamela Anderson, so let me make that absolutely clear,” an irate Nightwatchman said from Canberra this morning about the allegations he lost control of his bowels at the Engadine Maccas in 1997. 

“But Assange and Wikileaks started the vicious rumours, which are nothing more than toilet talk,” 

“Not toilet talk, let me rephrase, just garbage okay.” 

“Anyway, look, I’m a fair dinkum honest bloke, I think everyone knows that, I love a dogs eye for breakfast and a cold one straight after lunch on a Friday okay, but Assange is not coming back home after he tried to sling shit at me.”

Inner City Leftie To Vote Liberal After Shorten Vows To Make Electric Cars Less Exclusive

One of Betoota’s French Quarter residents has confirmed to The Advocate this afternoon that he will, ‘unfortunately,’ have to vote Liberal at the up coming election. 

The 45-year-old architect currently living in our town’s answer to Newtown, West End and Brunswick explained that he wasn’t going to have to vote for the Libs because the complex trust running in his family set-up could potentially be slugged for tax, but for something much worse.

Luént explained that if anyone was able to afford the electric cars so popular in the inner-city enclaves, they would ‘lose thier currency so to speak. 

“The beauty of a having the bottom of the range electric car set at 60,000 dollars is it allows people like myself the ability to brag about it at dinner parties, and keep firmly saddled in aboard our high horses.”

Telecommunication Customer Service Rep Pretends To Care About Local Woman’s Threats To Leave

TEXT:

An irate local woman has completely misjudged her audience this morning by assuming a part-time telecommunications employee actually cares about her threats to leave the company he’s only at to fund his heavy marijuana dependency.

It’s believed Natasha Phale spent a good 30 minutes on the phone to James, threatening that she would leave, unless they cut her monthly internet bill in half.

According to James, Natasha had absolutely no chance of getting that heavy a discount out of him, but he had to pretend to care as it is part of company policy.

“You have to say you’re going to speak to the manager, none of us do though. We use that as our unofficial tea breaks.”

“It’s pretty frustrating though, 80% of our phone calls are customers threatening to leave”

“The amount of people that actually leave is less than 10%”

“Could you imagine if everyone who threatened to leave, actually left? No one would have a telecommunication provider”

“I’m pretty sick of it tbh [sic]”

At the time of press, Natasha was still listed as a customer of James’ employer, likely not for a lack of trying – the terms and conditions of Natasha’s contract have her locked into an unbreakable contract for 18 months.

Success: Teen’s Crush Throws Self At Her After Forwarded Email To 15 Friends Within 30 Secs

TEXT:

Teenager Belinda Monk (15) has trouble believing her luck as the year 9 student has finally won the heart of her long time crush after successfully making a wish with a magical chain email she sent to 15 friends within 30 seconds of reading.

Perusing her email inbox, Monk found an email titled “Re:re:re:Re: – Important!~|~” and upon opening it discovered it was a famed ‘wish email’ that she had been so longingly waiting for. 

“I couldn’t believe my luck,” stated Monk

“Right away I sent it off to 15 people, closed my eyes and made a wish. I’m not an idiot.”

Immediately following the forwarding of the emails, Monk became aware of a knocking at her door and upon answering it discovered her crush was standing there professing his love for her. 

It is believed Monk has had a crush on now boyfriend Todd Henson (15) since year 7 but only last night did Henson make his intentions clear with Monk despite his only interaction with her being the time he accidently hit her with a chucked rubber that was meant for the person next to her.

“I just love her now,” stated Henson under the powerful spell of a chain email.

“That’s how it is.”

Monk was so ecstatic that she later added a paragraph to the chain wish email detailing her story so that all the readers would be inspired to do the same.

“I didn’t think it would happen to me, but after I sent it to 15 people WITHIN 30 SECONDS my wish came true and my crush knocked at my front door with a bottle of Coke and a packet of salt and vinegar chips.”

The interview was cut short when Monk had to quickly forward an email to her entire address book, as well as herself, in order to avoid being strangled by the restless ghost of a murdered child with access to a computer.

Nightwatchman Admits He Was On The Sauce For The 6 Months He Spent Plotting Turnbull’s Demise

TEXT:

“This is my leader and I’m ambitious for him [hiccup]” declared a seemingly sincere Scott Morrison, with his hand wrapped around Malcolm Turnbull, the Prime Minister of Australia

The date was August 22, 2018. Within 48 hours Malcolm Turnbull had resigned and Scott Morrison was sent on as the lower-order leader of the Coalition Government.

Speaking exclusively to an undercover Betoota Advocate intern who was posing as a Pentecostal youth pastor while wearing a hidden camera, the Nightwatchman admits to it all. It wasn’t just Tony and Dutton. He was the puppeteer behind last August’s leadership spill that saw Australia change Prime Ministers for the 8th time in eleven years.

But it wasn’t the Scott Morrison that we know and love from that inappropriate tourism ad with Lara Bingle. The jovial happy clapping marketing executive wasn’t behind this. This was a different person. A dangerous person. A person we now know as ‘The Nightwatchman’.

As the man who so desperately wants to be called ScoMo admits, everything he did in the 6 months leading up until that point happened while clouded by a haze of pure sauce.

“I was drinking a lot” he said.

“Six Goldies day at my worst. It was a really bad time”

“My political ambitions weren’t being met. My burning desires were being held by a glass ceiling that came in the shape of a well-spoken small-L liberal who had endured great success in his life outside politics. It sent me on a spiral. Why did this man deserve to have it all. The skillset to find work outside of politics… and the badge of Prime Minister”

“That’s why I was drinking”

Morrison says that while he’s successfully managed to pull off the Boris Johnson-style everyman who accidentally ended up in the top job as a less terrifying alternative to Peter Dutton, it was actually all orchestrated. By him. While he was on the sauce.

“I felt the way I imagine a gay man feels trapped in a heterosexual marriage, which for most of my life is where I thought they should stay. Well, I still do technically… But, when it comes to this particular comparison that I now regret attempting to make… I felt I deserved more than living my life as a caged bird”

“Most caged birds sing… But this caged bird. She drank”

“Sorry. He drank. I’m talking about me. I’m the caged bird in the most recent metaphor”

Morrison then went on to explain how basically he spent 6 months undermining and white-anting Malcolm Turnbull in an effort to make sure the Liberal Party never won another election with him as leader. 

It was a calculated plan that would completely remove the former Member for Wentworth’s weird multi-millionaire interests, like climate change and gay rights, from the entire political arena.

“If he won, the coal companies would be in trouble. If he won, we’d keep seeing convicted child abusing Priests being condemned by our political leaders. That isn’t my Australia”

The Nightwatchmen then paused before realising he was getting awfully deep for a light-hearted conversation with a stranger from his Cronulla Church.

“Anyway” he says, while straightening his jacket and wiping the villainous dilated pupils away.

“You go for the Sharks?”

“Haha go Sharkies!”

Gladys’s Team Reveal Justin Bieber’s ‘Sorry’ Is Her Campaign Song

TEXT:

The significance of today’s election is not lost on the current Premier of New South Wales, Gladys Berejiklian, with her campaign team announcing a last-minute change in strategy in hopes of appealing to the younger voters.

The team is reportedly using Justin Bieber’s pop mega-hit, ‘Sorry’, as the song to accompany any future advertising featuring the premier. 

It’s believed that the team have bought the rights to just the chorus and the bridge of the song, both of which repeatedly apologise.

“Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?” sings the first line of the chorus.

“Ooh, ooh, I’m sorry, yeah, ooh, ooh, sorry, yeah, ooh, ooh, sorry. Yeah, I know that I let you down, is it too late to say sorry now?” sings the bridge.

Although a little late to the party, Gladys’s team strongly believe that apologising for completely ruining everything good about NSW will give her the best shot at hanging on to the state’s top job.

While ‘Sorry’ is an absolute banger and won Justin Bieber his girlfriend back, it remains to be seen whether this catchy tune will be enough to make the disgruntled New South Walean’s forget about the botched light rail, the lock out laws, the denial of pill testing and all but ruining the music festival industry.

Uncle Gives The Double Honk While Pulling Out Of Nan’s Driveway After Lunch

TEXT:

The first family member to pull the pin on a light lunch today has made a point of cheerfully giving two toots of the horn as he doubles back from a u-turn at the end of nan’s cul-de-sac.

Uncle Todd, who actually owns a pretty tidy car in the shape of one of those wagon Holdens, can’t stay all arvo, mainly because he lives the furthest away and because there will be a bit of traffic by the time everyone else starts heading home.

Todd appears to have pre-planned this early exit, by being the first here to help Nan with moving some stuff around the back yard and even giving the gutters on the Titan shed a bit of a sweep.

After cleaning and firing up the barbecue and going hard on the beers for the first hour, before tapering down to only one per hour for every hour after the first hour, Todd is able to pull off a guilt-free getaway back to his rendered brick palace in Betoota Heights – where he will no doubt spend the rest of the evening watching True Detective in his air-conditioned home cinema that flash bastard.

It is not yet known what he’s got coming up for work this week, because as he mentioned earlier, work is a bit slow at this time of the year and most people don’t really think about sound-proofing their glass until at least a month before tax time.

Uncle Rick, an in-law who lives down the street and will be walking home actually didn’t get the chance to see Toddy off, but before he could finish asking where Todd went, the double honk had already rung out down the street.

“Oh he’s off already is he” said Uncle Rick.

“Wanted to ask him how works going”

Channel 7 Deletes Sunrise In Attempt To Shut Down Vile And Appalling Comments On Social Media

TEXT:

Executive staff at Channel 7 have today informed the reactionary interns running their social media team that they need to shut down Sunrise’s social media channels.

This comes after the television network faces backlash for deleting a photo of AFLW player Tayla Harris kicking a footy. 

The network said they deleted the photo after a number of inappropriate and offensive comments were left on the post, in a move that has been slammed across the board. 

That decision to give in to a bunch of lonely incels on the internet, has drawn criticism from all corners, and Channel 7 have doubled down today, deleting the social media accounts of the breakfast show Sunrise. 

“After seeing the appalling comments left on our Sunrise page, we’ve decided to delete the whole thing from the internet,” explained an executive at the network. 

“Sexist, racist, homophobic, you name it,” said the exec about the comments they saw on a video of Kochie giving Pauline oxygen again.

“Or the Nightwatchman talking about immigration again. Yikes”

“It was all there, so instead of trying to monitor our social media accounts properly we are just going to delete the whole thing.” 

“I wish we could delete it off the airwaves to be honest, but it’s the last profitable program on this dying medium of free-to-air television.”

Dark Clouds Of Two Stroke Exhaust Hover Above Brisbane After 80 Mils Over The Weekend

TEXT:

Every man and his dog is reportedly rushing home from work to fire up the mower after South-East Queensland received more than 150 millimetres in the 24 hours up to Monday morning.

Local authorities have identified the dark plumes of two-stroke exhaust currently hovering above Brisbane’s CBD as an ‘eye of the storm’ rush for lawn management.

With max temperatures predicted to be around 31 for the next few days, it is not lost of suburban lawnsmen that this is absolutely prime weather for the grass to bump up a couple inches.

One local man caught in back-to-back traffic on Coro’ Drive spoke to our reporters earlier, after taking an earlier mark from work to get back home and mow the bastard.

“I’m hearing another ten, twenty mils in the next few days. I’ve gotta get moving” said 42-year-old Ash Grove, while holding his hand firmly square on the car horn.

“Keep it moving fuck ya!” he shouts at the stationary traffic jam.

This comes as Tropical Cyclone Trevor formed off the north Queensland coast last night, and is currently about 500 kilometres north of Cairns on Monday morning.

Wyaralong Dam, in the Scenic Rim region, saw 175 millimetres fall since 9am on Sunday and the Gold Coast Seaway recorded 159 millimetres.

Experts predict a spike in 2nd-hand mower sales over the next 48 hours, as households around the country remember that they should have it fixed after the last mow.

“I’ve Got Me Cables If You Need A Jump Start?” Says Egg Boy

TEXT:

The new national hero that is Egg Boy has made more headlines this afternoon, after pulling up and asking a family broken down on the side of the road if they needed a hand. 

The incident occurred just moments ago when Egg Boy was on the way to visit some family members after watching the Rugby League with his elderly neighbour Frank. 

After keeping the old man company for a few hours as his beloved Parramatta Eels battled it out with the Penrith Panthers, Egg Boy jumped in the family car and headed off down the street. 

A short time after departing from his neighbour’s house the young man noticed a family with car problems. 

Pulling over he offered to help the family with the jumper leads behind the passenger seat. 

“You guys need a hand,” he said pulling up alongside the stressed out father. 

After being informed the family didn’t have Roadside Insurance, Egg Boy hopped out and helped them sort out their car troubles. 

Quickly chucking the kids a couple of pieces of gum that he had in the car, Egg Boy hooked up the leads and sorted out the issue almost immediately. 

Within minutes, the car troubles were sorted and the family were off to a birthday dinner at their Grandparents place.

Local Patriot Who Worships Ned Kelly And Chopper Disgusted By Egg Boy’s Civil Disobedience

TEXT:

A local far-right activist whose main interest outside sharing Neo-Nazi memes is his fetishising of Australian criminal folklore, says he is absolutely disgusted by the actions of egg boy.

With several tattoos paying homage to both Ned Kelly and Chopper Read, local patriot Wyatt Bokken has today called for criminal charges against that mad cunt who egged Senator Fraser Anning.

The local divorced father of 3 has spoken to The Advocate this morning, venting his frustrations about the actions of the ‘jumped up little shit.’

Unlike the rest of the country, Bokken isn’t a fan of the national hero colloquially known as ‘Egg Boy,’ who catapulted himself into the national consciousness this weekend. 

“Mate, what he did was down right disrespectful, however you look at it,” said the man who thinks the 5 incels who pinned down the young boy and tried to choke him out used a reasonable degree of force.

“The tone of political discussion has gone to shit in this country, no one has any respect,” explained Johnstone who previously described Neil Erikson’s mock beheading in Bendigo as one of the best videos he’d seen in a long time. 

“If the little lefty had any decency he’d front up and apologise to Anning for his behaviour and civil disobedience,” said the man with a tattoo of a notable figure who murdered three police officers. 

“And before you bring up the whole Chopper thing, what Chopper did was fucking funny, and his behaviour was towards crooks who deserve it, not a standup Senator whose speaking for the majority of the 19 people who voted for him.”

Australia Left In Shock After Witnessing Sincere And Competent Politician

TEXT:

New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has created great confusion for the Australian audiences watching her press conferences over the last 48 hours.

As the whinier-vowel neighbours of New Zealand, Australians are not familiar with a politician, or leader, who appears to be good at doing their job under pressure.

Namely because of the foreign concept of unity and bipartisanism has not been seen in Australia since both major political parties decided that the Adani coal mine was all good, and the Great Barrier Reef was just going to have to cop it.

With Ardern likely not having slept since Friday, and a nation grieving, the fact that she has been able to front the media without stirring any shit has been refreshing but also shocking for Australians.

“What. She’s not even going to swear revenge on anyone?” said one Australian TV viewer – Kylie, 45, Rocklea.

Another rattled Australian news reader also couldn’t believe Ardern’s rational and sincere approach to tragedy.

“Wait, so, she’s not going to blame this tragedy on her political rivals?” said Chad, 35, Maryborough.

“Well who’s fault is it? Who do we need to be scared of?!!”

“Give me someone to vilify god dammit!”

Scientists Uncover First Ever Woman To Be Happy With How She Looks In Passport Photo

TEXT:

Scientists at the CSIRO Betoota Site revealed today that they have uncovered something that could be truly life changing to women across Australia, and potentially the world.

The announcement came from Nigel Osmand, the lead researcher behind the breakthrough.

“We never thought it would be possible to find a woman happy with her passport photo, but here we are”

“She truly is a scientific marvel”

It’s believed the scientists discovered Michelle Carrington after she came into the CSIRO on a field trip with her year 3 class. It’s understood she was required to provide a photo for her check-in tag, at which point she handed over a spare passport photo, Ms Carrington was then told she didn’t have to choose that photo and that she could choose any photo she wanted to.

It was at this point Ms Carrington said, “Nah it’s ok, I like my passport photo.” 

This simple comment sent the CSIRO staff into absolute mayhem, several staff rushing to find Nigel and tell him what they discovered.

“We’ve brought her back in since then, we want her here for a week to run full body tests and brain scans to find out if Ms Carrington is just hardwired differently, or if there is a chance that her condition can be taught to other women.”

“It’s still early stages, but it’s looking promising”

“By as early as 2023, women across the country might stop complaining about their passport photos.”

With the European Summer travel season fast approaching, we can only hope Nigel and his team find success sooner than 2023.

Ewww: Bride’s Cousin Catches The Garter

TEXT:

A function space full of wedding guests let out a collective shudder last night as cousin of the bride Eric Kier (24) caught the garter.

As society continues to demand gender equality, the archaic wedding tradition of the ‘bouquet toss’ continues to be balanced out by the exceedingly popular and exceptionally seedy ‘garter toss.’ 

The ‘garter toss’ involves unmarried male wedding guests being rounded up and forced to attempt to catch a piece of cloth that has been around the bride’s thigh all day who is now presumably the wife of their friend or family member.

Seen by many as ‘just a bit of fun’ the harsh reality of what could go wrong during the tradition was realised for all the attendees as the hand that received the stocking fastener was that of the bride’s own flesh and blood.

“Aw…yuck,” murmured everyone who realised what had just happened.

“I guess Eric is the next one to…God that’s gross.”

Following the inadvertently incestuous experience, the wedding party failed to reach the same highs as before with many guests choosing to leave before the bride and groom, who eventually elected to leave through a private back entrance. 

The man at the centre of the controversy stated he didn’t want to catch his cousin’s garter but was forced into the ceremony and refused to be one of those guys who makes a big deal about not catching it.

“You have to watch what you do. If I let it sail by I end up getting branded a commitment-phobe for life,” stated the man. 

“What are you writing?”

Indigenous Woman Facing Jail For Unpaid Fines Applies For Priesthood

TEXT:

In a bold attempt at receiving a more lenient sentence, a young Indigenous woman without favour or finance has applied for a spot in the priesthood. 

The remote mother of two did so after realising that she was about to go before the judge on minor charges without the services of a high-flying barrister or solicitor. 

The self-represented litigant, who can’t afford to pay some sandstone alumni lawyer huge amounts of money in six-minute increments, told The Advocate that she hopes that a priesthood will get her a favourable sentence. 

“I’m pretty flat strap for cash at the moment because I have my income quarantined by the government, and can’t really afford decent legal representation unfortunately” “So I’ve dropped down into the lower tier of the legal system reserved for people from low socio-economic background’s and people with mental-health issues,” she said. 

The sole provider for several members of her extended family and wider community explained that she is hoping to not become another number in the prison system, which consists of 28% Indigenous Australians and is arguably the nation’s most serious human rights concern. 

“One day I’ll get a well-paying job and some connections and then I’ll get bumped back up into the tier reserved for corporate big wigs, notable figures and members of the clergy.” 

“Swing the scale of justice in my favour you know.”

“But for now, I’m hoping that I’m admitted to become a priest before sentencing so that I get off, or a light sentence at the worst.” 

“I mean if a priest can get 6 years for some of the most heinous crimes, then I’m I’ll probably get off without even a slap on the wrist.”

Nation Forced Into Most Productive Morning Of Work Since Early 2010

The country’s workforce has been coerced into being incredibly productive this morning, as most of the major social media platforms struggle with technical issues. 

In pleasant news for the nation’s employers, and middle managers who enjoy riding their employees to validate their existence, all platforms owned by Facebook are down, causing an incredible uptick in productivity.

With desk drones unable to scroll through Facebook and Instagram and hordes of people unable to post photo’s on WhatsApp, it’s believed that an incredible amount of work has been done before lunch – an amount not seen since Kesha punishing people with Tik Tok.

The technical issues have The Advocate newsroom twiddling thumbs this morning, with some reporters actually deciding to head to a local council meeting and Errol off for a fish on Lake Betoota.

A spokesperson from the Productivity Commission explained that it’s the most work around the country that’s actually been done since the Parramatta Eels and St Kilda actually knew how to play football. 

“It’s been incredible this morning,” said Beau Racrát from the Productivity Commission. 

“We’ve even had reports coming in that apprentices have been having conversations with their bosses at smoko, instead ‘of burying their heads in that fucking smartphone.'”

“It’s all going to go downhill once everything comes back online.”

Two Surfers End Up In Brawl After Disagreeing On Who Was More Stoked

TEXT:

Two surfers have ended up in a brawl this afternoon after the two long-haired yahoos couldn’t agree on who was more stoked.

The brawl took place on the shores of Betoota’s man-made wave dam out in the Old Quarry.

Witnesses at the scene say the incident started off rather calmly, with one of the men saying he was stoked with the amount of ‘dope’ ‘barrels’ he got in. 

It’s understood that the other man also said he was stoked with the number of buckets he chucked – or something to that effect.

“I could see that they were starting to get a bit riled up”

“I could hear ‘no, I’m more stoked’ ‘no, I’m more stoked’” said a witness.

The first punch was thrown by Aarren Ettylson after the other surfer, Hamish Haddaway, questioned the sincerity of Aarren’s stokedness.

“You don’t even know what stoked is” was allegedly the comment that drew first blood.

The two surfers have since been taken down to the local police station where they will make statements and decide whether or not they’ll press charges against one another. 

Our reporter at the station has said that the two men are in separate cells but are still trying to figure out who is more stoked.

“It’s a pretty bizarre scene down here, fellas”

“The two surfers just keep trying to be the most stoked person, it’s a very odd thing to fight about but who are we to judge”

Our reporter is staying at the station as the story continues to develop.

Abbott Goes To Effort Of Shelving Entire Bible Only To Realise Visiting Room Has Glass Screen

TEXT:

BREAKING NEWS

With Cardinal Pell on the verge of a lifetime of excommunication from The Catholic Church, Pope Francis has today ordered all of his subordinates to prevent him from getting his hands on another Bible.

Pope Francis says there are fears within the church that if the convicted pedophile were to have access to the holy book, he may be given license to continue justifying abhorrent and predatory behaviour.

However, Former Prime Minister Tony Abbott has vowed to not let a court’s ruling get in the way of his service to Australia’s highest-ranked Catholic figure – and has once again spoken with the Cardinal today.

“I don’t like to go against the Pope like this, George” said Abbott.

“But the PC police have obviously taken a position, and I must take the opposite. It’s how my CTE-riddled brain works”

“Besides, the Pope and I have clashed before on our treatment of homosexuals…”

“Speaking of… I have a present. But this glass is going to make it hard for me to give it to you”

Following an afternoon of trial and error, the Member For Warringah seems to have found a way to smuggle a Bible in the Melbourne correctional facility where Pell is currently being held on remand.

“Ahh fuck. This was truly a painful ordeal. How about I just read it to you and you take down notes”

“Hold on a second, I’ll just get it. This could be tricky”

‘Proud Catholics’ Ask To Now Only Be Referred To As ‘Catholics’

TEXT:

Australia’s Catholic community have asked for everyone to stop using the word ‘proud’ when describing them – after the church’s third-highest ranking member, Cardinal George Pell, has been found guilty of molesting two choirboys in 1996.

In a big blow for the Catholic community, Cardinal Pell is today facing his pre-sentencing hearing after his conviction of historic sexual offence charges.

Some other charges have been struck out because they happened ages ago and it’s hard to prove just what he did and didn’t do, even though he’s been proven to protect and aide colleagues who sexually assaulted children.

Yesterday’s revelations follow months of a media suppression order, which was lifted after the courts decided that NewsCorp may have interfered with the judicial process after reporting as much as they possibly could without explicitly printing his name.

He has strenuously denied the accusations and says if he did do anything even relatively inappropriate, it’s all good because you can ask for forgiveness in his religion, and he’s usually the one that decides is you have been forgiven

Pell’s remaining supporters, namely John Howard, Andrew Bolt and Miranda Devine have since been found dead on a really weird topographical landform that extends above the surrounding terrain

“We Are Going To Need A Fuckload Of African Teenagers To Survive This One” Abbott Tells Bolt

TEXT:

The Member For Warringah has arrived at the high-hedges of Toorak this afternoon on a private jet, in an effort to defend his beloved Catholic Church.

This follows the lifting of a nationwide suppression order which has allowed media to report that Pell has been found guilty of sexually abusing two choirboys when he was archbishop of Melbourne.

As his re-election chances take another body blow today, former Prime Minister Tony Abbott has had to take control of the narrative now surrounding the himself and the God-fearing child abuse apologists in public office.

This comes after Scott Morrison failed in his attempts at consoling Abbott. with wise words related to similar accusations surrounding a former leader of his own church.

Instead, he’s had to take matters into his own hands. First stop, Andrew Bolt’s home office.

Making his way into the sixteen bedroom Chatue De Bolt, Abbott was quick to get to business.

“I read your article accusing the traumatised choirboys of making shit up!” barked Abbott.

“It wasn’t enough. People see the word choirboys and they have already made their assumptions”

Abbott’s loyal servant appeared rattled.

“But, what else can I do sir?”

“Defending pedophiles is literally the bottom of the barrel”

Abbott smirked, before picking up a whiteboard pen and making his way towards Bolt’s beloved framed Bill Henson print, which he began using as a canvas for his brainstorm.

“We need a distraction” he said.

“Remember when Julia Gillard was dominating me in the polls and I started making jokes about her being an unmarried woman. We need that, but much bigger”

Both men briefly fell silent, before a mutual smirk appeared on both their faces.

“African gangs” they both shouted in unison.

After a weirdly intimate high five turned into a hug, Abbott was quick to snap back into game face.

“Get your iPhone! They’ve got cameras on them nowadays!”

Bolt began scrambling across his desk of self-written novels that will never be published.

“Got it!” shouted Bolt.

“Now get out there and start filming some black kids in Melbourne” barked Abbott

“The streets, the train stations, the basketball courts. I don’t care. Get whatever you can. Bait them even”

“I want this on the front page of the Sun and Telly tomorrow”

“We are gonna need a fuckload of African teenagers to survive this one”

NSW Parliament’s Upcoming Easter Celebrations Classed As A ‘High-Risk Festival’

TEXT:

NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian’s plan to excessively monitor the recreational activities of young people appears to be working against her today, after her own government accidentally applied the same standards to her idea of fun.

This follows the lifting of a nationwide suppression order has allowed media to report that Pell has been found guilty of sexually abusing two choirboys when he was archbishop of Melbourne.

These revelations have been timed poorly, just days after the announcement by NSW Racing Minister Paul Toole that organisers of celebratory ‘festivals’ or  festivities must obtain a licence under the coalition’s new licensing regime.

Festivals that appeal to baby boomers, such as the Sydney Festival, and Day On The Green – have been labelled ‘low risk’-  meaning they can obtain a free license from the Government just by asking.

However, anything that appeals to young people, such as music festivals or any form of a party – is likely to be labelled ‘high-risk’. This means organisers will be given a couple days warning and have to pay $200,000 for user-pay police officers to monitor the event.

However, due to the NSW Coalition Government’s delusional voter profiling that suggests young people are happy to do nothing with themselves except go to work and Church on Sundays, it appears Easter is at risk of being ruined by these news laws.

NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian is believed to be ‘ropeable’ this afternoon upon learning that her highly anticipated Easter ceremony in Parliament House has been labelled a ‘high-risk’ festival – due to the likelihood of someone getting molested.

“This is absolute rubbish. These laws aren’t mean to apply to people my age, or my friends” said the Premier.

“Pingers are far worse for young people then the systemic culture of child abuse in the Catholic Church… Festivals ruin lives”

A spokesperson for the Catholic Church has indicated that while they definitely have enough money in the kitty to pay $200,000 each time they want to have a service – they would appreciate it if non-believers would stop holding their entire institution accountable for the actions of a couple bad eggs. 

“We can’t be held responsible for the 20% of our clergyman accused of child abuse, as either perpetrators or protectors” said the spokesperson.

“Just because the third highest ranking Catholic in the world is a convicted child molester, it doesn’t mean all of us are.”

The entire planet is now free to tell Cardinal George Pell to get fucked today, after finally being able to talk openly about the stuff that we were all talking about months ago.

This comes after Cardinal Pell was found guilty of 5 counts of child sexual abuse in a landmark case for the country and the world. 

The guilty verdict relates to charges that occurred over 22 years ago, and were followed by decades of denials and assurances by powerful conservatives across the country, and the globe, that nothing untoward was occurring in the Catholic Church. 

Pell is set to be sentenced tomorrow after he months on bail recovering from a knee injury, with the suppression order on the verdict handed down on December 11 finally lifted today. 

The news has sent shockwaves around the world, with the once 3rd most senior offical in the Catholic Church likely to die in prison, where he will join the thousands of incarcerated felons whose lives fell apart after having their childhood stolen from them at the hands of powerful religious leaders like Pell.

The Catholic Church is yet to give a statement, but it’s probably in their best interests to fuck up about gay marriage and abortion for the time being.

Tarocash Robot Lets Out Long Beep And Looks On Longingly At Uni Pub Crawl

TEXT:

A corporate robot who shops at Tarocash is today regretting the decision to sign away his life to big industry, after seeing a group of young men and women stumbling drunkenly around the city at 11am on a Saturday. 

This is particularly hard for Derek Melrose to stomach because mid-week bending used to be his favourite past-time.   

“I never get to do that anymore” Derek woefully revealed to our reporter.

“Beeeeeeeeeeep” Derek sighed robotically.

Derek began his career in insurance 3 years ago, and while he started out thinking he would be able to resist the transformation into a corporate robot, about 1.5 years in he gave up the fight and let the system take over.

“They just wear you down man, beeeep” he sighed again.

“Look at those kids out there, drinking without a worry in the world”

“That one just vomited in the gutter”

“I miss that”

At this point Derek began crying, but in place of regular human tears, little drops of oil seeped out of his eyes.

“Sorry”

After recalibrating, Derek told our reporter that it’s not all bad, that he and his fellow robots treat themselves to an oil change every Friday lunch time and if they’re lucky, they even leave work early on Friday’s to go have beers.

“That’s the only thing we have to look forward to. It’s not much but at least it’s something.”

After stealing one more look at the drunk revellers, Derek shuffled back to his office where he will once again become an anonymous cog in the machine.

Local Sociopath Actually Sticks To One Beer Promise Down The Pub

TEXT:

A known binge drinker has sent shockwaves through his friendship group this afternoon after sticking to his statement of only having one beer and then going home. T

he shock development has left his close friends wondering if everything is alright with the big fella.

“Shit, do you think we should talk to him?” asked one concerned friend.

“Yeah, it’s unlike Brent to let us have a session without him.” Added another.

While Brenton’s sobriety should be commended, there are other factors at play that are leading friends and family to believe that Brenton has developed a mental disorder known as Sociopathy.

A sociopath is generally characterised as someone who has a complete disregard for other people and generally has antisocial behaviours and attitudes.

In this instance, Brenton has completely disregarded the feelings of his friends, he just left them at the pub with no explanation – sociopathic behaviour if we’ve ever seen it.

The Advocate sat down with Brenton Yilmaz to talk about his newfound sobriety and to check if everything was, in fact, ok at home.

“Yeah, why wouldn’t it be?” asked Brenton.

“Oh, is this because I didn’t get pissed last night?”

“Fark, I have one night off the beers and my mates have a go at me”

“Sorry for trying to get my life together”

It has been suggested that if Brenton flakes on another session the friends are going to take the matter further.

Naive Local Dog Thinks He’d Actually Enjoy Some Of Man’s Jungle Curry

TEXT:

This evening in a French Quarter terrace, one naïve good boy doesn’t know what he’s getting himself into.

“Nnnoooo, Toby, you silly sausage, you don’t want any of daddy’s Jungle Curry,” said one local man.

That only seemed to encourage Toby the animated dog, as he proceeded to sit down – a trick he knew would result in a treat.

“Naaww Toby! No, even though you’re sitting down I still can’t give you any”

“This isn’t good for you!”

Toby then barked three times, which is believed to roughly translate to “Don’t tell me what’s good for me, Bryan, just give me some fucking food”

This demand seemed to have hit home with the owner who then caved.

“Ohh Toby, ok, fine! But don’t say I didn’t warn you”

Toby then scoffed down his serving of Jungle Curry in less than 30 seconds, in the following 30 seconds the wave of spice could be seen hitting the dog.

He began dog-crying and drinking all the water in his dog bowl. 

“Oh my god! Toby! I knew I shouldn’t have given you any curry!”

At the time of press Toby was okay and only 24 hours away from begging for more of his owners food.

Every Single Dad In South East QLD Forced To Fix The Gutters After Decades Of Procrastination

TEXT:

A category 2 cyclone has finally forced the hands of dad’s across the South East Corner today. 

As Cyclone Oma making its way closer to the coast, meteorologists have issued a severe warning from Bundaberg to Ballina, including Brisbane, the Sunshine Coast, and the Gold Coast.

With a weekend of wild weather and strong winds expected, patriarch’s around along the coast have been furiously cursing the weather system this afternoon. 

It’s believed that every single dad in the region is currently up on the roof, or has been up on the roof trying to screw down that piece of tin or fix the gutters that haven’t been cleaned since 2013. 

While some bits of tin were in need of urgent attention, the Cyclone has provided plenty of other dad’s with a chance to get the tools out and make a bit of noise this afternoon. 

We spoke to one Sunnybank father named Darren Webke this afternoon as he attempted to fix a bit of flappy tin that had been causing him grief for a few years. 

Holding a screw in his mouth rather than his pocket for some reason, the 62 -year-old accountant spoke to us about why he took the afternoon off work to get his place ready for the storm. 

“This bit of fuckin tin will get ripped clean off if it’s not properly secured,” shouted an overly excited Webke moments ago. 

“I asked my son to help me over Christmas cause I knew it would be a fuckin problem but of course he was too busy or couldn’t be bothered and we didn’t get round to it.” 

“And now this bit of Ozito shit isn’t working properly. They don’t make tools properly anymore. They’re all shit now.” 

“Jesus, anyway, I’ve gotta finish this and then do the gutters that I haven’t cleaned since 2013. Either give us a hand or let me be please.” 

We then left.

German-Australian Community Prepare For The Worst As Cyclone Oma Arrives On The Gold Coast

TEXT:

The German-Australian community has issued a severe warning for a large stretch of the east coast from Bundaberg in Queensland to Ballina in New South Wales, after news that spirited European retiree is making her way to the Queensland South-East Corner.

Known only by her fitting nickname, ‘Cyclone Oma’ is currently just under 900 kilometres north-east of Brisbane and is moving towards the coast.

However, the category-two party girl is no longer expected to make it to the Queensland capital, and will instead fuck up the Gold Coast for the weekend.

“Although Oma is not expected to make it to Brissy in the coming days, she will be close enough to produce direct impacts along the Queensland and New South Wales coast” said a spokesperson for GADAMMIT (German And Dutch-Australians Monitoring Media Information Together).

“Thankfully she won’t make it to the German Club next to the Gabba, but we think just having her poolside on the Gold Coast is enough of a worry”

It is believed that staff at the Jupiters have been given explicit instructions to keep Cyclone Oma occupied as long as possible and try their best to pace her between cocktails.

Emergency personnel say they have also been briefed on the likelihood of being catcalled by the spunky bachelorette.

Fight At Train Station Far Enough Away To Enjoy

TEXT:

Commuters at Betoota Ponds train station were in for an absolute treat this morning as a fight between two fare evading passengers was the perfect combination of rich storytelling and being far enough away to enjoy without fearing for their safety. 

The two warring parties who were described by one bystander as “either adult looking teenagers or teenage looking adults,” initially engaged in discussion from the end of opposite train platforms where each had each chosen to smoke an undetectable downwind dirty bunga.

Proving that a cheeky toke doesn’t always make everyone mellow, the two pillars of society began arguing when one called out ‘Nice fake Vans’ loud enough for the other commuters to hear over their true crime podcasts, which they discretely muted in order to enjoy the real thing.

“They were hurling insults at each other but they had to keep repeating themselves as they were both playing hardstyle off their phones and couldn’t hear each other too well,” stated one witness.

“I was sitting in the shade munching a cheese and bacon while it was happening. Fuck it was funny.”

As the owner of the alleged fake Vans jumped across the tracks to defend himself from accusations that “he guzzles cum,” commuters briefly feared for their safety before remembering they were distant enough to treat the altercation for the experiential theatre it was.

“I knew what to do, I’m not an idiot,” stated one witness in reference to the smartphone footage he captured of the fight.

“Here comes the best bit…BOOM!”

At the time of writing, the video of the altercation currently has more views than the freestyle rap videos the two brawlers have uploaded to YouTube over the past five years.

Local Woman Says Goodbye Forever To Clothes She’s Dropping At Dry Cleaner

TEXT:

If ever there was an earthly representation of a black hole, Costa’s Dry Cleaning on Quarry Road would be it.

Over the past 3 years of living near Costa’s, Ava Managan (26) has lost over 15 articles of clothing.

This isn’t due to any business fault of Costa’s, but rather because Ava is incapable of remembering to pick up her dry cleaning after she’s dropped it off.

The Advocate caught up with Ava shortly after she’d just said an internal goodbye to another silk dress.

“I don’t know what’s wrong with me, I just forget my clothes every single time”

“I drop them off, forget, then flash forward 3 months and Costa’s sent them off to Vinnies”

“Someone out there is having an absolute field day thanks to me”

According to Costa’s website, any item left at the dry cleaner for longer than 2 months will be disposed of. 

Our reporter reached out to Costa to gain more of an insight into his business and to see if there are more people like Ava out there.

“Absolutely, the amount clothing that I send off is crazy”

“I’m pretty strict with the two-month rule, but if it’s a wedding dress or something valuable I’ll allow them three months”

“Ava is my best customer though, well she’s Vinnie’s best customer”

“Over the past 3 years she’s only remembered to pick up 4 dresses [haha]”

In an attempt to change habits, it’s believed that Ava has tattooed the word ‘dry cleaning’ on her hand. 

Our reporter is going to check in with Ava in 2 weeks to see if it’s been successful.

It didn’t take local woman Sarah Platts long to figure out what her roommate got up to last night after she walked out into their living room and found a Lime Bike and helmet discarded near the door. 

“Soph must have got hammered last night,” Platts said. 

“I didn’t even know she knew how to ride a bike” she informed our reporter. 

Whilst our reporter was still on the scene, Sophie emerged from her room looking and smelling a little worse for wear.

“What’s that Lime Bike doing in here?” she asked, slowly putting together the dots. 

“Shit, I must have been level 10 pissed last night to ride that home,” Sophie said. 

“How do you even hire them? How did I even ride it? I have so many questions”

“How’s it going to get out of here?”

Sophie’s situation seemed a little familiar, so our reporter reached out a Lime Bike representative for comment, however after being bounced around between people was ultimtately unsuccessful. 

An anonymous hacker, who The Advocate employs sometimes, was able to uncover the booking confirmations of Lime Bike and revealed that the company actually earn the majority of their income from hires between 10:30 pm and 2:00 am.

It’s yet to be confirmed if these are the hires of drunk people or simply those who enjoy light exercise at night.

Takeaway Shop From 12 Suburbs Away Advertising To You On Facebook

TEXT:

Social media user and aspiring human with a passion Kelly Wentworth (28) has felt a strange sense of joy, confusion and guilt as she continues to be served Facebook ads from a takeaway shop 12 suburbs from where she lives. 

On the lower end of the social media addicted spectrum, Wentworth checks Facebook only 88 times a day and last Monday began to notice she was being served ads for ‘Fat Jims,’ a chicken shop located in a suburb she has only ever driven through while on her way to a funeral. 

The advert in question features a triple chicken schnitzel burger called ‘Tha F**king Mother Cluka’ and a spicy alternative named ‘Cluck It’s Hot’ accompanied with the caption “Who could smash these on a Monday?” and a like from the business owner’s personal account and the business itself.

Upon seeing the advert, Wentworth was unsure whether the owner does not know how to use Facebook advertising or whether they want their business to stay top-of-mind when she is hungry and carefree in a suburb that she actively avoids.

“I’d go there if I wasn’t worried my iced coffee would be served with actual ice in it,” stated Wentworth as if the 35 minute drive from her place to the takeaway shop required a passport check.

“Why would I ever go there? If they fuck up their social media that bad why would I trust them to make me food I would never have the self esteem to eat?”

While it is clear the adverts will never convert her to a customer, Wentworth states the continued messaging does not bother her and often ends up being the best part of her day.  

“All my friends are getting married, politics is fucked and those generated friendship videos just remind me how far I have drifted from the people I used to care about. These ads are the only thing in my feed that makes me feel anything close to emotion. They’re probably the only reason I’m still alive.”

Weird Cousin One Of Those Guys

Like many of the households of Betoota Heights, the Lawsons consider themselves to be a wholesome bunch of regular people, a true nuclear family that lives up to the name by having a seemingly volatile matter bubbling just beneath the surface.

Looking in, it would seem parents Julie and Tom support their children’s interest in activities such as netball and soccer from a place of genuine love, when the reality is they really don’t want them turning out like their cousin Jacob (26) who is one of ‘those guys.’

Julie and Tom’s children Alex and Mel have had limited contact with their cousin Jacob mostly because he lives about an hour away which is pretty far to travel in order to visit a grown man who spends his weekends wearing chain mail he spent six months making while Rammstein blared in the background.  

“I don’t think there’s anything wrong with what Jacob does,” lied Tom Lawson.

“I’d be fine if my kids did that, as long as they wait until they’re a adults, leave home, change their names and never contact me again.”

According to Tom, he would like to have a relationship with his cousin if his impressionable children didn’t find the idea of an adult with swords mounted on the living room wall to be something to aspire to.

“They are not allowed to look him up on social media either. Turns out there are people who do what he does to a higher degree. Much higher.”

In an interview, Jarred Lawson stated that his Facebook profile which consists almost entirely of him hitting human shaped haystacks with arrows has not affected his work life.

“I get offered jobs at JB HiFi all the fucking time,” smiled Lawson as he Googled mid-ranged Damascus steel daggers.

At approximately 9:45 pm, Susing’s neighbour Donatello Pajaron heard a sharp series of screams from her apartment and immediately called the police. 

Hearing continued screams, the first respondents enacted an immediate plan to enter the apartment by force, knocking down the front door to discover Ms. Susing was watching a video of a puppy eating a watermelon on her phone.

“I just get so excited, it’s so cute!” stated Susing at a pitch that could almost get the attention of nearby dogs. 

“Look at them, they’re just babies!”

After the initial chaos of having her home broken into by a group of a dozen armed men and women, Susing invited them to sit with her and watch the remainder of the video, the climax of which involved one puppy licking watermelon off another’s nose.

Kraft Release Nut Free Peanut Butter To Accommodate Gen-Z

Kraft has today announced a nut-free peanut butter to accommodate Gen-Z children with nut allergies that still want to eat peanut butter. 

A spokesperson from the brand told the press that this was not an early April fool’s joke, and that they expect the new product to do quite well.

“We’re really getting on the front foot with this product,” said Ms Single.

“The number of children with nut allergies is increasing at an alarming rate, that’s bad news for a nut spread company.”

“You’ve got to evolve your product as society does.”

When questioned about what was in the nut-free peanut butter, and if it was a healthy option for kids, Ms Single became rather vague.

“Umm, I’m not too sure of the exact ingredients – I’ll have to get back to you, I can safely say no nuts!”

“For kids with nut allergies, it is definitely healthier than eating peanut butter.”

“That’s all I have time for today, thank you.”

Following the interview, The Advocate reached out to a health star rating company to see how the new product faired.

“The nut free peanut butter has a health star rating of -3, there’s absolutely no nutrients in it and definitely nothing natural.”

“Regular peanut butter at least has peanuts in it, this has nothing. I would not let my kids eat this.”

Banking Sector’s Image Repaired After ANZ CEO Spends Entire Day Pretending To Be Poor

TEXT:

The worries and concerns of many in the banking sector have been alleviated today. 

With the final report from the Royal Commission into the Banking and Financial Services Industry being handed out yesterday, a whole raft of measures have been proposed, including criminal charges. 

While many across the board were starting to panic about things like the mortgage broking sector being rubbed out, criminal sanctions and a regulator being given powers to actually regulate, some good PR seems to have fixed all of those issues. 

That PR, thanks to ANZ CEO Shayne Elliot, came in the form of the exec standing out on the street pretending to be poor for a whole day yesterday. 

Posing for the cameras yesterday, Elliot pretended to try and sell the popular magazine the Big Issue outside his bank’s offices in Sydney’s CBD. 

It’s being reported this afternoon that despite months of revelations and exposés about the criminal and immoral conduct taking place in the industry, Elliot’s yesterday have single-handedly repaired sectors public image. 

“It’s incredible,” said another Bank exec called Gree Di-Phúc to The Advocate today. 

“He managed to make everyone forget about all the crook shit we’ve been doing over the last few decades thanks to moral bankruptcy and financial de-regulation.” 

“I personally think it was the 1 dollar 7-11 coffee he was drinking that got us over the line.”

Great Barrier Reef Takes To Social Media To Post Incredible #10YearChallenge Photo

The nations greatest natural wonder has taken to it’s social media channels this morning to post an incredible transformation picture. 

Following the lead of celebrities across the globe and people you aren’t really friends with on your social media feed, the Great Barrier Reef posted a #TenYearChallenge photo on Facebook and Instagram today. 

The natural organism posted a photo of itself from 10 years ago, looking incredibly vibrant and colourful, alongside a photo of itself from this year looking incredibly bleached thanks to years of incessant coal mining and blatant inaction towards climate change by a string of both state and federal Governments.

Demonstrating it’s cheeky and humorous side, the reef posted a caption on the photo saying; “Doing one of these #TenYearChallenges, haha OMG I used to be so tanned back then!” 

Speaking to The Advocate moments ago, the Reef said it thought it would be a great opportunity to get active again on it’s socials. 

“I haven’t posted anything since JT retired last year, so I thought I whack up the photo and have a little bit of fun,” the natural wonder said. 

The photo has received plenty of attention on social media, garnering nearly 2,000 sad reacts on the Facebook post. 

However, the post hasn’t been taken in good spirit by everyone, with One Nation leader Pauline Hanson hitting out at the reef. 

Accusing the reef of doctoring the picture using photoshop, Hanson slammed the tourist attraction for trying to promote unrealistic reef images. 

“The reef has clearly photoshopped that, or added a white filter over the top of the second image in some attempt to please the PC Brigade,” said Hanson.

“It’s disgraceful if I’m honest.”

Triple J Confirm Hottest 100 Votes Are Ineligible Unless They Are Posted On Social Media

TEXT:

In some breaking music news coming out of Sydney, it has been confirmed today that votes cast for Triple J’s Hottest One Hundred will not actually count unless they have been posted on social media.

The controversial move comes less than a month out from voting closing and is believed to have thrown many who ‘slaved’ over their top ten songs for the year into disarray.

The popular national radio station made the announcement this morning and informed listeners on the airwaves that anyone who had voted but hadn’t posted their votes on social media would need to either post their votes on their channels, or vote again and post.

“Hey guys, music news announcement here,” said the godfather of music programming on the station Richard Kingsmill.

“This year the Hottest 100 is having a bit of a shakeup. Anyone who doesn’t post their music selection on social media to let their followers know they have a distinct and unique taste in music won’t be eligible to have their votes counted,” he said.

“So make sure you get it up online to have your say,” he said.

Kingsmill told The Advocate that there had been internal discussions about whether people who complained about how long it took them to compile their votes or how hard it was to decide on ‘JUST’ ten songs should have their votes count for double.

“Maybe next year,” laughed Kingsmill.

Geoffrey Rush Thinking About Pulling A Spacey

TEXT:

In some breaking news out of Sydney, Academy Award-winning actor Geoffrey Rush has revealed to The Advocate that he is contemplating pulling ‘a spacey.’

Rush told us of the drastic move after more allegations of inappropriate conduct were levelled at him.

The allegations come from ‘Orange Is The New Black’ star Yael Stone, who made explosive claims that Rush exposed himself to her backstage, sent her sexually suggestive text messages, and attempted to spy on her while she was showering.

The events happened in 2010 and 2011 during the play Diary of a Madman, and Stone says she is speaking publicly on the matter to help compel change in the entertainment industry.

Rush has denied the allegations, but told us that despite his denial it might be time to pull ‘a spacey.’

According to the American Law Society, The Spacey Defence is defined as: Publicly proclaiming that you’re gay when you get called out for committing inappropriate and/or criminal behaviour. 

The theatre and film veteran explained that if things start to get sour he might be pulling The Spacey Defence in an attempt to distract and absolve himself a little.

“Obviously with this defamation stuff about to be decided, and now this fresh set of allegations regarding behaviour that I may or may not have done that will tarnish my name, I think it’s time to come out as gay,” said the Thespian icon.

“Hopefully it will make all this go away.”

Full time stay at home son, Jesse Wickens (34), never saw himself becoming an activist but has found himself fighting for the greater good, asking the question ‘what about men’s rights?’ from the comfort of his childhood home where his mum still does his laundry.

Saunders claims that sexism is a problem that was solved in the ’60s and that he lives in an equal world where he worked hard for everything he has, which appears to be an Xbox 360 with two controllers his mum still buys the batteries for.

“What about violence against men?” asked Wickens on an NRL Facebook post against domestic violence.

“What are youse doin [sic] to stop violence against men?”

Critics of the early balding activist have noted that he may not be the best person to discuss gender issues as his mother is responsible for the entirety of his domestic duties, despite the fact that he has spent so much time on the couch that it has changed his already appalling posture.

“It’s not a bloody sexist thing, and not because sexism doesn’t exist, but because I don’t know how to do it and she does. What’s sexist about that?”

“She doesn’t know a fucking thing on how to fish for Alaskan King Crabs. That kills heaps of men every year. Is that sexist or some new age bullshit now?”

Wickens admits, he is not the ideal poster boy for men’s rights but claims to know several more impressive men’s rights activist who claim to have actually seen a woman naked, some without even paying for it.

Senator Canavan Begins Destroying Adani Paper Trail Ahead Of Federal Anti-Corruption Body

It’s been all stations go at the Federal Resources Minister’s office today.

With Scott Morrison announcing a new federal anti-corruption body this morning, the Resources Minister Matt Canavan and his staff have been getting on the front foot.

Labor, the Greens and minor parties have long campaigned for a corruption watchdog, and in the current political climate, Morrison decided to make the federal style ICAC a reality.

However, while many around the country are pleased with the decision, for someone like Canavan, it’s thrown his day into a spin.

“Yes, we’ve been flat out here,” Canavan said to us moments ago.

The government minister who said it was an honour to represent the mining sector earlier this year, explained that they have had a lot of work to do today.

“I think we’ve destroyed most of the paper trail from Adani and other companies this morning, and only have a few more bundles to do now,” he said.

“Fuck it’s a prick of a day to do it up here too. It’s fucking stinking hot and not ideal conditions to be standing around a bin fire,” he said while wiping the sweat from his brow.

“But you’ve got to do what you’ve got to do.”

Canavan said he has had a few frantic calls from other federal politicians as well today, as the news about the anti-corruption body spreads.

“Dasher (Sam Dastyari) told me he’s going to plead with Sco-Mo to make sure no one who can read written Chinese is hired, and a few of the Labor boys down in Melbourne have been chucking their documents of the docks into the water.”

“Hopefully everyone’s watertight by the time it gets set up,” Canavan said.

‘No Fear’ Bumper Sticker Seemingly At Odds With Owners Opinions On Immigrants

TEXT:

Contractor Owen Green (33) has been accused of the hypocrisy of the highest order, as his NO FEAR bumper sticker seems to be completely at odds with his opinion on immigrants.

An avid bumper sticker collector, Green has hidden the rust on his red land cruiser ute with a collection of stickers that seem to predate tolerance entirely.

“If this offends you, youse [sic] can get fucked,” stated Green, gesturing towards the rear of his ute, caked so densely with stickers that he likely has zero rear view visibility.

“Huntin’, fishin’, rootin’, what’s wrong with that?”

Featuring stickers of evil clowns, skulls making obscene hand gestures, the murder of a MY FAMILY sticker family and the mandatory RM Williams longhorn, the rear of Green’s ute is a tour de force of messages that resonate with people who think political correctness is a threat to democracy, whatever that may be.

However, the sticker that has caused the most controversy is one that simply reads NO FEAR, which friends of Green point out is an interesting choice for a man who looks like a terrified widow every time the topic of immigrants is brought up.

“Oi, nah, they’re gonna try and take my job but,” stated Green, forgetting he has several colleagues who are immigrants that he likes as they’re ‘one of the good ones’ according to him.

“I’m not afraid of them, I just don’t want them near me. Are there any near me right now? Why did you bring this up, I wanted to have a nap today, fuck me.”

Millennial Begins Enjoying Life After Setting Standards Incredibly Low

TEXT:

Local millennial Nina Turner (27) claims to have unlocked the key to happiness and is enjoying adult life for the first time after setting her standards incredibly low.

After graduating with a Bachelor of Communications, Turner first learnt she might have her expectations set too high when she actually expected her tertiary education to land her a job.

Following a series of other disappointing realisations, Turner states her road to Damascus moment came on a rainy day when her bus was two hours late and she resigned herself to walking home once the rain stopped.

“Then low and behold, two hours after that, it was there,” stated Turner, still twitching slightly from a botched septum piercing.

“After thinking it [the bus] would never come, a four-hour wait wasn’t so bad.”

As she sat squeezed between two un-showered personal trainers, Turner reflected on how she could begin to use her lowered expectations to her advantage and begin to feel fulfilled by the bare minimum of basic human needs.

“I was looking for a place to live at the time and I decided my only criteria was that there be no hole in the ceiling and no housemates who use needles. Imagine how happy I felt when I got a place with the ceiling hole boarded up and housemates who only smoke or snort their ice!”

The revolutionary technique has worked wonders on Turner’s love life who is happily dating a chain-smoking career busker who is bald at 23 but still a much better match for her than Newman from Seinfeld if he was racist and had an STI.

“Greg is so great compared to racist Newman with chlamydia. I mean Greg has chlamydia too but at least it’s not herpes right! He’s my bald koala!”

Turner has begun practising her teachings on an Instagram profile that has grown exponentially higher than she ever expected with over 80 followers who engage with Turner’s advice on how to enjoy any meal as long as you imagine eating a plate of human faeces that you paid $60 for first.

While the move has been justified by both major parties due to the fact that 95% of people being watched by national spy agencies use an encrypted messaging service, a group of friends are not happy.

Ben Derwin, a spokesperson for the group chat ‘Benny’s Bender Boiz’ explained that the far-reaching new laws are of grave concern to him and his immediate friendship circle.

“It’s fucked that the government can intercept the messages that we are sending,” he said.

Despite the fact that the most criminal things taking place in the group are the use of the word ‘Yewwwwww,’ the quality of some deep fried memes, and the odd drug possession related video, Derwin is adamant that his civil liberties are being infringed.

“It’s fucked man, what’s next?” he asked as if anyone at ASIO could give a single fuck about his mate’s depraved bender videos and cooked late night chat.

“I don’t know, yeah they might say they are going after terrorists and stuff, but what’s stopping them from nabbing me for doing a fat slug in the group chat?”

We told him that we weren’t in a position to offer legal advice, but explained that there are 25+ million people in the country and that they probably weren’t going to bother reading through his scat group chat unless there were some fucked buzzwords in there.

“War On Christmas” And Other Things Scott Morrison Might Pull Out Of His Arse This Week

TEXT:

After having already tried his luck with the Australia Day debate, religious freedoms, Muslims not condemning terrorists and the national security risk posed by social media – it appears there are only a few more stereotypical populist cliches that Prime Minister Morrison can pull out of his sleeve before everyone tunes out of politics over Christmas.

After spending the last fortnight being pinballed around Parliament by a growing crossbench and a right-wing faction within his own party, Scott Morrison has only a short window in the 2018 calendar year to accuse the PC police of trying to ban Christmas.

As a devout Christian and an an increasingly noisy populist, Morrison is in a perfect position to take advantage of middle Australia’s nostalgia and appreciation for this time of the year, by accusing ‘lefties’ of trying to take it away from them.

However a ‘War On Christmas’ isn’t the only play left in his book. Political analysts say ScoMo could also make a run at how a lack of coal will see old people being unable to afford to turn on their air conditioning this summer.

Failing that, the Prime Minister could accuse Lebanese teenagers of ruining the atmosphere at Cronulla beach over the holidays, and send text messages to all of his mates encouraging them to bash wogs on sight.

Correlation Established Between Doing Shoeys and Yelling ‘Nice Garry’ For No Reason

TEXT:

A landmark study has been released today finding a direct link between two of society’s most painfully obnoxious acts.

The report released by the Betoota Anthropological Society (BAS) concluded that there is a definitive correlation between doing ‘Shoeys’ and yelling ‘Niceeeee Garrrrrrrry’ or ‘Bowling Garrrrrrrry,’ for no reason at all.

The above phrase was made popular by former Australia Wicket Keeper Matthew Wade who used to chirp the phrase at bowler Nathan Lyon whose nickname is ‘Garry,’ and has since become prevalent in popular culture.

The Head of BAS Mark Harden explained to us that they have spent nearly 12 months compiling the data and finalised their research on the phrase today after the summer of cricket began.

“What we have found is that those young men who tend to make people uncomfortable by doing ‘Shoeys’ in any social situation involving alcohol, are also the same men who yell the phrase made popular by the former Australian Wicket Keeper,” Harden said.

“With the test summer beginning today, Australians should be prepared for a barrage of ‘Nice Garys.'”

Harden explained that they were currently trying to figure out why the young men in question carried out both of the acts mentioned above.

“We believe it may have something to do with a lack of other defining personality traits, but can’t say for certain just yet,” Harden said.

He then explained that anyone saying the phrase ironically was exempt from the findings.

“People don’t yell it ironically every 10 minutes.”

Government Almost As Obsessed With Gay Kids In Catholic Schools As The Priests Are

TEXT:

Coalition nightwatchman and current Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, has today been unable to get his party to agree that gay kids shouldn’t be expelled from Catholic schools for being gay.

This backwards slide in policy indicates that the Coalition government is almost as obsessed with gay kids in religious schools as the rock spider priests and teachers that appear to make up a worryingly large number of the education staff in these institutions.

This appears to be quite an interesting feat, considering that the Royal Commission Into Institutional Responses To Child Abuse found that roughly 20% of all clergymen in Australia over the last century have either abused children, or protected abusers.

Leading to many political analysts asking who are the 20% of the Coalition Government who think that the Catholic Church and similarly stigmatised religious institutions should be allowed to do whatever they want – even after the Royal Commission findings that indicate that most of them should be shut down forever.

This follows the nation’s Catholic schools sensationally announced last month that would vow to rid all their schools of pedophiles, once they had gotten rid of all the gay kids – who’s sexual preferences reportedly goes against the teachings of the Church.

Prime Minister proposed a conscience vote earlier Wednesday after Labor and the Coalition failed to find a compromise on changing the Sex Discrimination Act.

This comes after months of discussions between the Liberal and National Party MPs, who after considering how badly their government is performing, decided it is time to focus on the big issues that concern all Australians.

Namely, the fact that the 13% of Australian private schools that are run by the church feeling like they are being bullied by people who think they shouldn’t be able to pick on gay kids.

President Trump Has A Great Meeting With Man He Thinks Is Named Malcolm

TEXT:

Despite a schedule full of watching Fox News and tweeting (almost definitely from the toilet) US President Donald Trump managed to find time to meet with Australia’s Prime Minister who according to him is a guy called Malcolm.

In his search to meet someone who represents the average Australian, Prime Minister Scott Morrison organised to meet with the billionaire US President at the G20 summit and stated the meeting went well despite the fact Trump referred to him as ‘Trunbull’ at various points of the conversation.

“I think it’s the start to a great relationship,” stated Mr Morrison as if he is ever going to see him again.

“By the way, if anyone asks I have a mansion in Point Piper and my wife’s name is Lucy. Please do this for me.”

According to the US President, his meeting with ‘President Trunchbull’ went very well and he is considering making Australia one of his closest allies if Putin says that’s ok.

“Very good President of Australia, they call him Crocadoo Jack, King of the Outback,” stated Mr Trump.

“The Australian’s love him and is doing tremendously well. A lot of people don’t know where Australia is, I know where it is, President Trundle from Australia knows where it is, the thing is, you’ve got to know where your own country is and President Malcolm Morris Trundler will be Australia’s leader for many years to come.”

PM Ploughs Through Beyoncè Discography In Effort To Better Understand His Female Colleagues

TEXT:

A desperate Prime Minister Morrison has today made an effort to mend his relationship with the remaining female MPs within his government, after Julia Banks resigned from the Liberal Party on Tuesday, a decision that has plunged the Morrison Government further into minority.

Banks’ decision to leave the party sends a devastating message to voters that the Liberal Party is hostile to women. It’s an issue that Morrison is eager to resolve after learning that Bill Shorten is somehow being viewed as a feminist icon when placed in comparison to him.

Morrison has today made the executive decision to listen to every single record released by iconic female American pop star Beyoncè Knowles. From her seminal teenage albums with Destiny’s Child, right through to her most recent release under the band name The Carters, with her husband Jay-Z.

“I just want my Queens to slay” said the Prime Minister.

“And it seems like Julia [Banks] is of the opinion that the party decided to dip and now we wanna trip”

Morrison says he was first alerted to his party’s gender division on Monday, when he walked into Julia Banks’ Parliamentary office to find her putting everything in a box to the left.

“She told me, in no uncertain terms, that she could have another [party leader] in a minute”

Morrison asked the former Director of Corporate Affairs for Kraft Foods Asia-Pacific if there was any chance she could find it in her to make some lemonade of of the systematic sexism she faces every day.

Banks responded by saying that things were fine at home and that she was leaving the Liberal Party because she was constantly being intimidated and bullied by a far-right faction of namely Craig Kelly MP, Peter Dutton and Tony Abbott that honestly think this country is being tricked by elitist progressives into saving the environment and treating homosexuals like humans, despite having every major newspaper in their pocket – and are in turn taking their frustrations out on their assertive female colleagues with public ambitions that may be misleading young Australian women into thinking they can find a rewarding life outside of the kitchen and may be part of the reason that their daughters don’t speak to them anymore.

Morrison gazed into the distance and nodded as Julia Banks explained her reasons, before explaining to Ms Banks that he now has 100 problems.

ARIAS: Label Executives Overheard Discussing Benefits Of This New Thing Called Social Media

TEXT:

When it comes to fashion, the guests at the 2018 ARIA Awards have certainly brought it.

So far we’ve seen frilly pink ensembles and champagne layered dresses, some dudes in suits, low neckline cocktail dresses, push up bras with bridal tails, couple more dudes in suits and of course linen jumpsuits!

However, while the women may be on top of their game, it’s the faceless industry execs that make this event.

This is where business gets done. Where the high cogs of the industry finally get the opportunity to meet.

This is where Sony sits down with Universal. Where Kingsmill sits down with Wilkins. Where the playmakers exchange knowledge.

In fact, fuck the dresses!

The most exciting thing we’ve seen on the red carpet tonight is a bunch of 90-year-old label executives discussing the benefits of this new thing called social media.

“It’s not bad, I hear” says iconic industry codger, Dennis Chugginski (99).

“Yeah. I’ve heard some of the musicians have been doing their own press with it! We don’t even need to put up posters anymore” says lifelong rival but equally as powerful, Michael Gudhandlin (98).

“Did you know you can put video clips up online on this FaceTube thing?” says Gudhandlin.

“We’ve actually signed a few kids that had only ever been played on the internet”

“It’s almost like the whole FM radio thing is losing it’s touch”

Both men paused for a second, before breaking out into laughter.

“Oh yeah… the internet’s the future you reckon?” chuckled Chugginski.

“Yeah… and let me guess you think newspapers are going to disappear by next year”

Both men patted each other on the back before walking into the venue to watch a performance by someone who was on Triple J unearthed eight months ago and has since been listed as a Falls Festival headline with just 20 plays on NOVA and 8k Instagram followers.

Sydney Opera House Employ RSA Marshal For First Time Ever Ahead Of Betoota Advocate Roadshow

For the first time in Australian stage and theatre history, The Sydney Opera House has been forced to hire an RSA Marshal for this weekend only.

This comes as an array of unrefined and uncouth Sydney residents, as well as regional visitors, make their way to the iconic Australian landmark to see The Betoota Advocate Roadshow, in it’s last ever show live from the Opera House concert hall.

The man hired for the job goes by the title of #01, or his given name, Iosefa Manu. A 32-year-old Betoota resident that was recommended by our newspaper’s editors, given his experience at managing excitable rural partygoers at The Betoota Races and The Betoota Gymkana.

This decision marks yet another world first for the Opera House management, only months after deciding to let Alan Jones advertise his mates Gumtree Ad on the sails of the treasured public asset.

As a 13-date national tour comes to a close, The Betoota Advocate has just the Lewellyn Hall in Canberra this Friday night, and the Sydney Opera House this city before they can fuck off back to the desert for another year.

Local Rooting Machine Can’t Say Too Much About Schoolies Around Mum Haha

A formerly awkward teenager has returned back to town after schoolies week with a bit of swag, and a new pair of sunnies, it has been confirmed.

After pulling back into the drive-way of the family home in his dark green 1994 VW Golf, the whole neighbourhood stops for a moment to take in the new man.

The 17-year-old James Cleary is now known as Jimmy… And he says words like ‘lit’ and ‘savage’ in day-to-day conversations.

“Haha, what-up” says Jimmy, as his younger siblings rush to his car to ask questions about his exciting week away away.

“Did you see Damo on the news?” chuckles Jimmy, who also goes by Jimmy C now.

“He was so lit.. He’d had like a six pack in half an hour and then they interviewed him about some guy that got tasered. Haha such a crack up”

Jimmy C’s four younger siblings, who range in age between 4 and 13, have never met Damo before, but want to know more.

His teenage brother Kyle asks the question everyone is waiting for.

“Did you meet a girl?”

“Oooooh” says the crowd of siblings, which is now growing with a few other local neighbourhood kids.

Jimmy C lowers his sunglasses down his nose so that his eyes are just visible.

“Well, haha” he says, while poking his left index finger through a circle made with his right index finger and thumb.

“Lets just say”

“… I can’t say too much around mum”

“Haha”

At time of press Jimmy was seen checking himself out in the kitchen window with a completely popped collar.

Nearby Bucks Party Looks Like A Horrible Time

A bunch of awkward blokes that are turning into a bunch of drunk awkward blokes at the TAB the Lord Kidman Hotel in Betoota’s Old City District, don’t look like they are having much fun.

In fact, according to witnesses this apparent bucks party looks like it’s pretty shit

This could be because they could be a fatal concoction of smaller friendship circles merged into one, it could because no one in the pub is treating them like the drunken gods they think they are, or it could be because they are shit blokes.

Judging by the banter coming from their table, it’s most likely the latter.

With some of them now veering down a path of saying racist shit to commuters from the balcony of the pub, two men of shorter stature are currently engaged in a semi-serious grapple right near the bear, in front of about seven civillians who don’t give a fuck about who out of this group is getting married.

“Hahah oi fuck off you fucken gay cunt!” shouts one of the high-pitched off-duty IT salesmen.

“That fucken canes! stop bending my fucken fingers back you fucking cunt!”

At time of press one of these sloppy wrecks was apologising profusely after spilling a vodka red bull sunrise down the front of a 71-year-old woman’s blouse while she was trying to order a counter meal.

Emergency Response Crews Called After Huntsman Spotted In Living Room Of Local Sharehouse

TEXT:

A local sharehouse is currently at panic stations this afternoon after a spider was spotted by two of its residents in the living room.

The 4 bedroom sharehouse in Betoota’s French Quarter is currently being held hostage by a moderately sized huntsman spider.

Spotted a few minutes ago by two of the residents, the Huntsman has caused emergency response crews to be called out to the scene.

One of the residents named Caitlin spoke to us over the phone moments ago, explaining that appropriate phone calls had been made within seconds of sighting the harmless spider.

“We’ve run out of things to throw at it [the spider], so we just have to hold tight until someone turns up soon. We threw the remote as well so we are stuck on the fucking Chase” Caitlin said over the phone.

“We’ve called our housemate Toby, and Grace [the other housemate] called her boyfriend to come and kill it.”

“They said they couldn’t come until after work? Could you come over maybe and kill it?”

We informed the stranded young women that we wouldn’t be able to make it, unfortunately.

Caitlin then told us that she was fully aware that Huntsmen were not poisonous, but they were ‘still fucked.’

“If it was a Funnel Web or a Redback no problems at all. I’d just whack it and kill it,” she said.

“But Hunstmen are fucked.”

“Anyway if you can’t help I need to call someone else,” she said before the line went dead.

Country Town Hospital In Wine Region Not Struggling For Rural Placements

TEXT:

The once-struggling Channel Country General Hospital in Bedourie is reportedly sorting through a backlog of thousands of rural placement requests.

This follows the area’s well-noted transformation from a sleepy fruit growing district into one of Western Queensland’s most praised wine regions.

As seen in Central West New South Wales, Southern Western Australia and most of the districts surrounding Adelaide – the idea of spending a whole year swishing through sample sized glasses of shiraz has revolutionised the standard of rural medicine in Bedourie.

The Channel Country General Hospital says while they are slightly concerned about the amount of interns rocking up to work with crimson coloured teeth, it is a real privilege to host some of the brightest minds from the big city universities.

As imagined, this trend has in turn created a concerning shortage of doctors in towns that don’t have the resources to treat half-pissed medicine students to a chilly afternoon drinking wine until they begin making out with each other in the back of a mini-van.

Towns like Blackwater, Mt Isa and Broome have responded to this challenge by trying their best to grow grapes, but inevitably settling for craft brewery tours – which has resulted in an influx of overweight of trainee doctors with sugar headaches in these historic mining areas.

Cabbie Praised For At Least Mentioning Weather Before Launching Into “Fucking Uber” Rant

TEXT:

A local Taxi Driver is being lauded with praise today, after managing to squeeze in some weather conversation before launching into his Uber rant.

The 52-year-old man from the Flightpath District named Peter Lee managed to pull off the feat a short time ago as he picked a passenger up from Betoota Airport.

The cabbie of nigh on 30 years made some brief chat about the odd for this time of year cold snap coming through town this week, much to the surprise of his passenger, before getting stuck into the customary anti-ride share tirade.

“Kudos to him, I mean that’s exemplary service. He actually listened to my response when he asked me how my day was and made some chat about the weather before we got started,” the passenger said.

Lee then reportedly jumped into the ‘Fucking Uber’ rant immediately after with something resembling a segue.

“This cold weathers is fucked, but not as fucked as this fucking new Uber coming through,” he began before setting off on the usual cabbies spiel.

Lee’s passenger told us The Advocate that while he feels for the Taxi industry, he just isn’t sure what he is supposed to do about it.

“Yeah, I mean they all got fucked over when these ride-sharing companies arrived. Their seven figure taxi plates are virtually worthless and their career has been thrown into jeopardy, but I’m not sure what I’m supposed to actually do,” the passenger said.

“The new companies are cheaper for me, and I don’t really need to take a cab unless it’s for work. As I said, I feel bad for them, but at the same time they are part of a capitalist market that they use to their benefit when fleecing pissed passengers and anyone desperate for a lift somewhere.”

Local Bushie Blows The Dust Off His Insta Stories After Being Invited Out On Someone’s Boat

TEXT:

Judging by Tim Bearfoot’s tenth consecutive Instagram story this afternoon, he is on a boat.

The stories have been a mixture of selfie videos and poorly framed wider contextual shots of the boat and its wake as he cruises around somewhere of the Queensland coast.

This influx of sharing has come as a surprise to his followers as the young bushie very rarely offers insights into his life on the farm, probably because there’s not much interest in seeing drought content anymore.

According to Bearfoot’s stories he boarded the boat at about 10:30am with a couple of his mates, one of whom is the owner of the boat – made known by a story dedicated to him.

“Plumbing business must be booming, hey fellas,” he can be heard saying in the video while showing off the boat.

From there, the frequency of videos appears to increase concurrently with his level of intoxication, yet the quality of the videos decreases dramatically.

The Advocate reached out to Bearfoot via his DM’s to get a few more details about the dam voyage.

“Get a water taxi out here right now!” was his first reply.

We then asked whether he thought he might continue to hold a presence on Instagram he replied,

“Oh yeah nah I dunno hey fellas, it’s a bit of a hassle”

While this answer is rather non-committal, The Advocate understands that Tim is attending another friend’s wedding later in the month, so we will see if love compels him to share more or if it’s restricted to purely water born occasions.

Local Woman Posts Heart-Warming Tribute To Dead Childhood Pet On Exclusively Human Medium

Jane Harris (@ImStillJaneyFromTheBlock) is in mourning today after her childhood dog, Chester, was fatally bitten by a snake while out exploring on her family’s hobby farm.

This tragedy was made known by a heart-warming tribute she posted for her dead pet on social media, a one hundred percent human exclusive medium.

‘Goodbye Chester, you were more than a dog, you were my best friend. I’ll never forget all the adventures we had together, or when you chewed up all my shoes! Wherever you are now, know that I will always miss you and love you’

The post has already seen an outpouring of support from her followers and accumulated over 300 likes, which is a record for Jane.

It’s not yet known what this public sharing of grief will do for Jane, or if the message was ever intended to reach her dead dog.

According to social media analyst and psychologist, Mary-Anne Gasson, public postings like this are no more than a cry for attention.

“You see it all the time now, people posting specifically about relatives or animals that don’t even use the platform.”

“They’re seeking gratification from their followers, rather than being in the moment with whomever they’re posting about.”

Despite Jane’s emotional tribute to the late Chester, a new Instagram post indicates that she has already moved on – With an equally pointless post directed at her new dog, Antigua.

“That’s exactly what’s in this bottle. Now, it’s not on the market yet but how would you like to try a bottle?”

“It’s free! For the first seven days you can trial it and see the results for yourself, then after those seven days you can buy more and sell them on to your friends!”

“I know this sounds too good to be true, but it’s not! There are no gimmicks, no gotchas, just a great opportunity.”

“Um nah, I’m good thanks. You can just pull over here,” Wakefield said.

It’s understood that Kayla ended her rideshare journey a lot earlier than intended purely to escape the barrage of bullshit coming from her Uber driver.

“If the supplements are so good, why is this bloke still driving Ubers to flog them off instead of being picked up by some multinational vitamin company?”

The Advocate can confirm that it’s because the products they’re selling are no good and most likely part of some pyramid scheme.

PM Criticised For Not Reporting Possible Criminal Behaviour Within His Religious Community

TEXT:

Australia’s first Pentecostal Christian Prime Minister has today been accused of sticking his head in the sand and not identifying clearly anti-social behaviour within his own religious community.

Critics say they cannot understand how, as one of the 300,000 Australians that adhere to the renewal movement within Protestant Christianity, Morrison failed to report the actions of a man he has only met in passing at a few NRL functions over the last decade.

This follows the news that the NSW Child Abuse and Sex Crimes Squad are investigating sexual assault allegations levelled against rugby league superstar Jarryd Hayne, who like Morrison is a high-profile devotee to the pentecostal denomination known as the Assemblies of God

A police spokeswoman has confirmed police are investigating an alleged sexual assault that took place in the Hunter region in late September.

This investigation marks the second time Jarryd Hayne has been accused of such crimes – leaving many political commentators to question whether or not his pastors and fellow churchgoers should shoulder blame for not identifying his criminal tendencies and reporting him to authorities sooner.

Hayne, who remains in a protracted legal battle launched against him by yet another accuser in the US in December last year, is one several high-profile Pentecostal Christians to be investigated for multiple sex crimes – which raises questions about whether or not the 300,000 regular churchgoers of Hillsong and Shirelive should be held accountable and vilified for not having intervened and prevented these individuals to save the cops some embarrassment.

Local Woman Immediately Regrets Saying Hello To Chirpy Senior Citizen While On Public Transport

It’s understood Claire made her first mistake when she politely greeted the old man as she sat down next to him, it was this simple greeting that opened the floodgates.

“And your boyfriend, what does he do?” Asked Ron Dickson both innocently and invasively.

“Where did you meet? I met my wife…” Ron continued but it’s too long-winded to report.

Suit Thrown Into Existential Crisis After Being Asked To Tick ‘I’m Not A Robot’ Captcha Box

TEXT:

A local city worker has been thrown into a state of confusion and self-doubt this afternoon.

The existential crisis came on after the finance sector employee named Jake Brailey was thrown a somewhat abstract curveball just moments ago.

Sitting in the same seat he does every day in Betoota’s Old City District the upper-middle-class white-collar male was confronted by an online security ‘Captcha’ asking him to demonstrate he was not a robot.

However rather than just simply ticking the box and getting on with whatever form he was filling out or platform he was logging into, the young man reportedly froze.

Sitting there for some time in a mid-afternoon lull, Brailey was left questioning his very being.

“I’m not a robot,” he whispered to himself.

“But then again, maybe I am. I’m living the generic white picket fence life, living for the weekend, only so I can go and be in the outdoors or go shopping for stuff I don’t really need or even want.”

“I want to become a partner, just so I can enjoy everything that comes with that status, but what else am I living for?”

“Maybe I am a robot,” said the man having an Albert Camus moment.

The young man reportedly tried to tell the Captcha ‘a bit about himself as a person,’ before verbally stumbling and walking off to the bathroom to wash his face and look himself in the mirror.

Returning to the computer a short time later the young man clicked the box and finished whatever it was he was doing.

“That was fucked, I’m not sure what came over me,” he said to our reporters.

“Anyway, that sort of self-awareness has no place in this office, and my life in general, so I’ll just treat it as an odd little anomaly.”

“Anyway I’ve got social mixed touch on this evening so I’ve gotta go now.”

Unemployed Mate Invites Charity Door Knockers Inside For A Billy

TEXT:

Productivity was at an all-time low for local unemployed man Henry Stewart (20) who at approximately 11:30 am today invited a pair of charity door knockers inside to smoke a billy with him.

With no job or other daytime commitments to fulfil, Stewart found himself with nothing to do other than decide whether he would spend his day committing a needless act of virtual violence as an ancient Greek assassin or a turn of the century highwayman.

Less than an hour after starting his busy day, Stewart was interrupted as two-door knockers from a homeless shelter arrived at his home and asked if he could spare any change to help people who were just like him but without parents to take advantage of.

Not wanting to dip into his meagre Carlton Dry and White Ox fund, Stewart said he had no coins but offered to reward the young men for their hard work by inviting them inside to smoke some cannabis he had just chopped out of a Gatorade saxophone.

“You wanna stay for a coupla cones?” asked Stewart, waving his pinky and thumb at a pair of individuals who have only ever gone as hard as vanilla Coke.

“I’ve got Brooklyn 99 on.”

Donation collector Gareth Kingston (30) stated he tentatively peered into Stewart’s home to see if he was being serious only to have many of his senses roughly assaulted.

“It was chaos in there. We wouldn’t even of had to share a bong he had that many.”

Politely declining his offer, Kingston and his associate left Stewart to spend his day inhaling drugs before pretending to be asleep when his parents got home.

“Good to meet him though. Will make it easier when we’re helping him off the street in a couple of years.”

Unconfirmed rumours currently suggest Stewart later offered the same smokable olive branch to an Australia Post courier, Dominos delivery driver and a teenager who accidentally kicked a ball into his yard, all of whom accepted.

Suit Listening To Kendrick With The Windows Down Wants You To Know He’s A Thinker

TEXT:

Pedestrians in Betoota’s Old City District have been treated to the music of Compton rapper Kendrick Lamar, courtesy of Liam McKenzie who played the tunes from his car because he wants you to know he’s a bit of a thinker actually.

The start-up merchant has recently been concerned that his public image is that of an uptight suit without any sense of culture, leading to him to drive his loaned convertible BMW with a customised number plate around his neighbourhood while playing Kendrick Lamar deep tracks.

“Hip hop with a meaning speaks to me,” stated McKenzie as he sat stationary at a green light.

“Kendrick and I come from very different walks of life but we’ve both had struggle and we’ve both had success.”

McKenzie later confirmed the struggle he was referring to was a case of good old fashioned Australian tall poppy syndrome in which people have tried to cut him down ‘just like they did with King Kunta.’

“There’s more to me than my seven to nine hustle and designer ties. I play basketball and I even go for an American team. LA Lakers which in Spanish means The Lakers.”

As McKenzie drives around his excessively gentrified neighbourhood playing music so loudly it manages to annoy people who actually like Kendrick Lamar, he considers all the good he can do in the neighbourhood with his third app idea in five years.

“One thing I learnt through K.Dot is when you make it big, give back.”

Just as everyone started to think he was a thinker, McKenzie crashed his car into a crochet-bombed tree after passing out from exhaustion from trying to rap along to Rigamortis. He has asked that his estate be given to ‘street kids’ and to have ‘Sing About Me’ played at his funeral.

Less than a week in and local dad and humble moustache wearer Omer Demir (55) is already sick of all these Movember moustache tourists.

Having never played contact sport, Demir took to facial hair to prove his masculinity but opted for a moustache instead of a beard as he still wanted people to visit his rug shop without shaking in fear post 9/11.

Demir states he has put up with a lot as his former slum in Betoota’s Flight Path District has slowly become a gentrified suburb frequented by less successful arty types, but the annual increase of moustached men is a step too far for him.

“They call those things moustaches?” stated Demir as he stroked what looked like a majestic moth that had landed beneath his nose.

“You’re trying to save lives? How about save my eyes and shave that bloody thing off! It doesn’t even touch your lips!”

Worse than having to look at the feeble moustache attempts according to Demir is the sheer quantity of customers who ask him if he too is participating in Movember.

“I tell them if I was participating in Movember they would have found a cure by now.”

“They usually leave without buying anything right after I say that.”

Christmas Now Close Enough To Write Off Visiting Nan Until Christmas

TEXT:

With warmer weather and prematurely festive businesses reminding you you’re about to go broke spending money buying presents for people, local man Jacob Burton (26) has realised Christmas is now close enough for him to write off an overdue visit to nans until December 25th.

Despite working part-time, Burton still manages to find time to complain about work and put off visiting his nan, a woman that he really loves but lives about 45 minutes away from.

Now with Christmas less than two months away, Burton thinks it is unlikely he will be able to visit his grandma and he has to fit in time to do last minute Christmas shopping and find out what everyone is doing for New Years.

“If I visit her now, we won’t have as much to talk about come Christmas,” stated Burton, using the same logic he used to avoid seeing her before Easter, nearly 10 months ago.

“I saw her not that long ago though, we saw Kung Fu Panda 3, it was great.”

Burton attributes his visiting neglect to “life getting in the way” and not the fact that visiting his nan in her nursing home is a horrible reminder of the final undignified years of life that awaits us all coupled with an undeniable old people smell.

Very aware it has been a long time between cuppas for him and his nan Burton claims he has big plans to make it up to her by buying her another modern history book she will never read this Christmas.

“It’s about the ‘30s. Where she’s from!”

Committed to visiting her more often, Burton states he is turning over a new leaf in 2019 and will be visiting his old nan so often she may eventually be sick of him.

“My resolution is to visit her once a month. Same as it was this year.”

Geoffrey Rush Involved In Low Speed Car Chase Across Harbour Bridge In 1992 White Ford Bronco

TEXT:

For more than an hour, a white 1993 Ford Bronco has been making its way across metropolitan New South Wales. Behind it, a convoy of NSW police cars trailing the SUV through 50 kilometres of Sydney City. Above, police and TV helicopters hover like wedge-tail eagles.

This follows the revelations made by stage actor Mark Winter, who played Edgar during the Sydney Theatre Company (STC) production in 2015-16, who gave evidence in Mr Rush’s defamation case against Nationwide News today.

Mr Rush is suing Sydney’s Daily Telegraph over articles printed late last year that claimed he behaved inappropriately towards a younger female colleague during the production.

However, Winter’s comments come as an inconvenient twist to Rush’s lawyers, which until now had a fool proof case against the uneducated masses who dare acquaint Australian theatre’s golden boy with the low brow Western Suburbs criminals and rugby league players usually skewered by the Daily Telegraph.

Rush, who has long detested the allegations made against him, has been forced into a desperate low speed police car chase, after yet another millennial thespian backed up claims made about him being a creepy old sex pest.

Crowds of boomer creative elites are believed to be cheering on the white bronco from vantage points in both The Rocks and Kirribilli, as Rush makes his way across the Sydney Harbour Bridge.

“We believe you Geoffrey!” shouts one androgynous silver-haired heiress from the steps of Fort Street Primary school.

“Don’t let these heathens win!”

“You are purely collateral for a much bigger issue involving mostly crass comedians and sports stars”

Considering the current court proceedings are related to charges laid by the actor himself, it is not yet known why Geoffrey Rush is even on the run, or why police are chasing him.

This is a developing story.

Millennial Without Photo Of Departures Gate Accused Of Lying About Holiday

TEXT:

The reputation of Wanderlust stricken traveller Casey Lee (24) is in tatters as the aspiring second-year uni student was unable to produce a photo at the airport departure sign, casting doubt on whether or not she even went overseas at all.

Having travelled to all the world’s most diverse locations where you can get a great picture wearing a bikini on a yacht, Lee states she recently took some time to visit her grandma in Beijing although can’t back up this claim with a photo of her standing beneath a sign that reads “Departures.”

“No picture with the departures sign? Please!” stated critic and life-friend of Lee, Belinda Hortense.

“Next she’ll want us to believe she travelled without a plane ticket too.”

While Lee was able to produce photos of her Beijing visit at street markets and having dinner with her grandma, many are convinced that she could have taken those photos anywhere and that if she really had been overseas she’d have a photo of herself smiling radiantly beneath an un-miraculous sign at the business end of unyielding Australian airport security to prove it.

“I just didn’t take one this time,” stated Lee.

“You don’t have to take one every time.”

Her assertion that you don’t have to take a photo at the departure gate to prove you’ve gone overseas was laughed off by the roughly 750,000 middle-class members of Generation Y.

Film Student At Great Gatsby Party Painfully Insists On Speaking Like 1920s Broadcaster

TEXT:

Arthur Riesling irritated many at a Gatsby-themed party last night.

The film student from Betoota’s French Quarter did so during a shindig at a local sharehouse with a number of other guests.

Attending a Gatsby-themed party on a Wednesday night, as only university students can do, Reisling was reportedly hell-bent on putting everything into his outfit.

“All right chaps,” he allegedly said walking into the party early last night dipping his top hat.

“Hoooww (sic) are we flappers,” he then said in a painful attempt at a roaring 20’s accent.

“Wednesday night’s the berries innnnit (sic), anyone got a gasper.”

Reisling then reportedly spent the next 3 hours meandering around the party going full method acting.

One of the guests named Ben Phillips told us that it took a lot of self-control not to give the young man an uppercut.

“I think I speak for 90% of the people last night by saying that he (Arthur) was almost begging for a short jab,” Phillips said.

“I mean fuck me. I’m all for a good time and enjoy having a laugh, but that 1920’s London accent is beyond painful when some dipshit like Arthur starts parading around spouting it.”

Another party guest told us that he actually walked away from a conversation with Arthur without even giving an excuse.

“I didn’t even bother making up some reason why I had to leave the conversation, I just walked off,” the other guest said.

“Maybe what I did was rude.”

“But his accent was fucking rude.”

Arthur was allegedly the last to live the party alone after everyone refused to let him know where they were heading off to.

“I’m Back, Motherfuckers” Whispers Malcolm Turnbull After Lucy Dusts Off The Leather Jacket

TEXT:

Former Liberal Party leader Malcolm Turnbull is reportedly ready to flex, after the news that he will be making his first major media appearance since his last address as outgoing Prime Minister more than two months ago.

Mr Turnbull is set to appear on ABC’s Q&A live on Thursday, November 8 at 8pm AEDT, where he is expecting to answer questions put to him by the public on everything from party politics – to why he was never given the freedom to do anything about things that concern him like climate change – as well his Tony Abbott should be assessed for early onset dementia.

After a big day of not talking to reporters outside his harbourside mansion in Point Piper, it is believed that Turnbull returned home to see a nostalgic garment waiting for him in his walk-in wardrobe.

“Oh Lucy…” he said, tears welling in his eyes.

“You didn’t”

Former Lord Mayor of Sydney and long-suffering ex Prime Minister’s wife, Lucy Turnbull, approached her husband from behind and gently placed her hands on his shoulders.

“It’s time, Malcolm”

“When that leather jacket comes on, it’s all over for these hoes”

Malcolm Turnbull then took a deep breathe and stared menacingly at the iconic leather jacket Lucy had hung up for him.

The same jacket that brought him so much power in his days as leader of the opposition, before he was ousted for Tony Abbott because he accidentally accused Wayne Swan and Kevin Rudd of political corruption based off a forged email, before finally clawing back his job as the leader of the opposition after two lib spills in 2015, only to be then ousted himself, for Scott Morrison, after Tony Abbott got into Peter Dutton’s ear like Don King and encourage him to challenge the Prime Minister for his job, only to ultimately embarrass the entire party and ensure a loss at the upcoming federal election.

However, all of that is behind him now. All the drama that comes with a toxic workplace full of undervalued older white men is just a faint silhouette in his rearview.

Because he’s going on Q&A next week. And that fucking jacket is coming with him.

“I’m back, motherfuckers” whispered Mr Turnbull.

Lucy cracks a faint smile and nods in agreeance.

“Yes you are, Moomoo” she said.

“Yes you are’

Local Man Can’t Wait To Spend Next Fortnight Living As An Outlaw In The Late 1800’s Wild West

TEXT:

A morbidly obese Betoota Heights resident has today made it clear that he will not be leaving the couch for at least a fortnight.

Luke Lockett (31) a website programmer who works from home, says that while he isn’t actually that well known for leaving the house, the next few weeks will be his most anti-social yet. As he plans to be situated on the couch in the granny flat adjoining his childhood home, living off just energy drinks and doritos until he has finished his Wild West cosplay.

“Basically…” says Luke, while breathing heavily between different mouthfuls of pizza.

“It’s 1899, the era of the Wild West is coming to an end. After a robbery in the town of Blackwater goes wrong, me, and the Van der Linde gang are forced to flee. With the authorities and the best bounty hunters in the nation massing on our heels, my gang must rob, steal, and fight across miles of American wildness and civilization to survive.”

Luke takes a big sip of 7/11 slurpee and wipes his brow.

“Sounds pretty mad hey”

“So pretty much as internal divisions threaten to tear our close-knitted criminal organisation apart, I must choose between my own ideals and loyalty to the gang.”

Naive Bushies Visiting The City Recognised As The Last Gold Mine For Charity Muggers

TEXT:

Just when a Scottish Backpacker was beginning to think he may have to jump on a Viber call to his parents back home, the world handed him a lifeline.

Gregor Boyle was doing it tough down in the harbour city of Sydney, with rejection after rejection starting to take its toll.

Unable to get a labouring gig for his short working holiday in the city, 22-year-old Boyle had to turn to the clutches of the charity.

Chugging away aimlessly for a couple of weeks for some beer, food and hostel money, the young man was at the verge of losing all hope, until, he spotted a honeypot.

A honeypot in the form an elderly couple from out of town, meandering through the city.

“If it had been a week ago, I would have felt sorry for them and let them continue their wander down the street. But this week was tough,” Boyle said.

“So when they naively made eye contact with me, a friendly young man, I knew I could lock on.”

Boyle explained that he talked to the friendly farmers from a place he had never heard of, but pretended to recognise for the purpose of keeping the conversation ticking along, about the plight of some kids in a third world country.

“I got it done,” he then said to us.

“I’m not proud of it, and I wished I didn’t have to. But life’s a piece of shit sometimes.”

“Besides, they’re hardly going to be going without because they are sponsoring the kids and me.”

Local Mum 19 Days Into Ocsober Still Feeling Like She Is Running The Gauntlet At Breath Test

TEXT:

A local mother irrationally went through a raft of scenarios in her head moments ago.

The young mum of 2 has stayed true to her pledge not to drink during the month of October so far, notching up day number 19 today.

However, despite not having had an alcoholic beverage in nearly three weeks, Mahlia Vincent (29) was still shitting bricks waiting for the police to breathalyse her.

Sitting on the side of the road on the corner of Silver Street in Betoota’s CBD, Vincent couldn’t help but feel the butterflies bouncing around the lining of her stomach.

“Had anything to drink today mam?” asked the officer bored out of his brains on a Friday afternoon.

“Um, no I’m actually doing Ocsober,” said Vincent, chalking up another opportunity to tell someone about her incredible sacrifice and willpower.

“Good on you. You should be fine then” said the officer not caring in the slightest about her efforts.

After the results came back, and Vincent, as was to be expected, had a blood alcohol result of zero, she spoke to our reporters.

“I don’t know, every time I get pulled over it shakes me. I’ve never actually been pinged for driving under the influence, but I always get so nervous,” she said.

“God knows how much of a mess I’d be if I actually was touch and go during the count to 10.”

“I’ve always been like that though. It’s irrational. Like back in the glory days, I’d still be freaking out whenever I saw the dogs at Festys, even though I’d always dropped them already anyway,” she said.

“Just one of those things you know.”

Liam Hemsworth And Miley Cyrus Reportedly Caught Up In Byron Bay Hardcore Scene

TEXT:

Byron Bay’s newest power couple, Victorian actor Liam Hemsworth and his American fiancee Miley Cyrus have reportedly gone ‘full Byron’.

This comes after spending the last few years on an off in the North New South Wales with the other Hemsworth siblings.

The A-list couple called off their first engagement in 2013, but rekindled their romance in January 2016 while ringing in the New Year in Byron Bay – making the Northern Rivers region especially sentimental for the Hollywood superstars.

Despite a recent hippy rebrand over the last decade, Byron Bay has been unable to shake off the hardcore scene that became popular with actual local kids in the early 2000s.

Speaking to The Betoota Advocate today while icing a fat lip he got while opening up the pit last night, Liam Hemsworth says it means a lot that he and Miley have been accepted by the Parkway Drive crowd.

“It means a lot. I mean, we want to make Byron our home. So we need to do as the locals do, not the feral dreadlocked blow-ins from Bondi” he said.

“Anyway, Fuck Rex Hunt”

At time of press Liam and Miley were seen perusing new straight-edge ink at a Lennox Heads ink tattoo parlour.

Nauru Detainees Traumatic Childhood Behind Bars To Be Blamed On ‘Administrative Error’

TEXT:

Thanks to an explosive leak from inside the Coalition Party Room, the government’s updated plan for the asylum seekers detained on Nauru can be unveiled today.

The Betoota Advocate can exclusively reveal that the Morrison lead Government plans to blame the whole issue on an ‘administrative error.’

This comes after Government senators voted with Pauline Hanson on her ‘It’s OK to Be White,’ motion yesterday, as a result of an administrative error.

It is believed that the same stance will be trotted out to justify the human rights abuses experienced by detainees on Nauru, as well as the potential impending deaths.

The issue has been raised for the umptieth time after nearly 6,000 medical practitioners and students signed a petition that was delivered to Parliament House on Monday demanding the children be removed from the small Pacific island because of serious mental and physical health concerns.

Doctors are increasingly concerned about roughly 80 children who have been on the island for nearly 5 years, with reports of attempted child suicides emerging in recent days.

The Liberal Senator who requested anonymity told The Advocate that the government plan to just ignore the issue until something really bad happens.

“Even though New Zealand are literally willing to take these kids and their families tomorrow, we are going to leave them on this small island without any services to prove that we are willing to take a hard stance on Immigration,” the senator said.

“And when it goes pear-shaped, we will ignore that fact that all bar a couple of us decided not to exercise any form of conscience or free thought whatsoever, and simply blame the whole debacle on an administrative error.”

“”Sorry technical problems,” we will tell the public and United Nations.”

“Foolproof!”

Many around the country have been following the two young popstar Royals around the harbour city of Sydney today, with all of major mainstream news organisation’s covering every little move Prince Harry and Meghan Markle make, as well as the minutia of the outfit that the Duchess of Sussex is wearing of course. 

Landing in the country yesterday, the newly married couple have made a few public appearances so far, much to the delight of Royal enthusiasts who have flocked from far and wide. 

Meeting with the Governor General Peter Cosgrove this morning, The Duke of Sussex was reportedly shocked to learn that the country had changed Prime Minister’s again since his trip last year. 

It can now be revealed that only moments ago, Prince Harry relayed the information back to our Head of State Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II in a state of bewilderment. 

“Honest to God Grandma, they’ve changed horses again,” our reporter heard the popular young figure say over the phone. 

“They got rid of the silver tongue silk and have replaced him with this goofy weirdo soccer dad kind of guy.” 

Our reporter heard some laughing coming out of the speaker of the phone. 

“I know Nan, they couldn’t organise a piss up in a brewery down here. There will probably be a new one next year as well, if this guy makes it through the year that is,” Harry then said. 

“Imagine how poor old Theresa would go in this circus!” he said before bursting into laughter. 

“Anyway we’ve got to get ready, we are going to Dubbo soon. Apparently the locals call it Dub Vegas,” he said.

Uncultured Man Drinks Cocktail With Full Grip

TEXT:

A local man has today worked up the courage to order his first ever cocktail at a trendy bar in Betoota’s meat packing district.

According to Jack Scales (29) the menu may as well have been in Japanese, with none of the cocktail names meaning anything to him at all. After staring at the menu and pretending he knew what he was doing, Scales placed his order.

“I’ll have one expression please.”

It’s understood that the effeminate bartender stared back with a blank look, prompting Scales to hold up the menu and point to his cocktail rather than repeating himself.

“Oh, you want an espresso martini, dolls” said the bartender.

This exchange went smoothly enough, Scales thinking to himself “this cocktail business is piss easy”

His smugness was replaced by confusion shortly after he received his drink and took his first sip. One witness at the scene explains why.

“He just grabbed it, by the scruff of the neck, like a dog”

“He was holding it full grip – it was like he’d never had a cocktail before!” said the horrified onlooker.

Scales, like a pup that’s not sure what he did wrong, looked around at the other patrons who were staring back in shock – being in the trendy part of town they’d never seen a cocktail treated this way before.

Thankfully for Scales it was at this point that his girlfriend arrived, rescuing him from the judgmental eyes piercing his esteem. She quickly showed him glass holding etiquette and the couple continued to enjoy their date. It’s understood that Scales later ordered 24 chicken wings to accompany his next Espresso Martini.

Urgent Recall Ordered On Club Sangers After Barnaby Finds Sharp Object In Armidale Pub Lunch

TEXT:

The former Deputy Prime Minister of Australia has cast himself back into the headlines again today after calling for a drastic action to contain a potential threat to pub feeds around the nation.

Barnaby Joyce told The Betoota Advocate just moments ago that he will be calling for an urgent recall on all Club Sandwiches across Australia, after finding sharp objects lodged inside a counter meal at the White Bull Hotel in Armidale.

Similar to the Steak Sanger, The ‘Club’ is a sandwich which is believed to have originated from mens clubs in New York, but has spread to menus around the world over the last century,

Seething with rage, Joyce told us that for the safety of the nation there must be a halt on all serving of the famous sandwiches.

“I couldn’t believe it,” Joyce said.

“I had a bite of my meal and got pricked in the mouth because there was some wooden spike lodged in the middle of it.”

“It’s lucky I was switched on and hadn’t been on the squirt, otherwise I would’ve probably finished the thing with a wooden spike lodged in my mouth” Joyce said.

The pub at the centre of the allegations said they tried to convince the seething Nationals representative that the sharp object was part of the meal itself, and traditionally holds the sandwich together.

“He wasn’t having any of it though” the publican said.

“He was worked up into a rage about club sanger terrorism and just said he’d be calling for a ban on them in future.”

2018 Koori Knock Out Erupts In Cheers As Beloved Special Envoy Arrives At Dubbo In Private Jet

TEXT:

Former Prime Minister Uncle Tony X has decided to risk a possible parole violation by chartering a government aeroplane to Dubbo so that he can catch the final rounds of the 2018 Koori Knock Out.

This follows a whirlwind month for Uncle Tony, ever since he was gifted the role of Special Envoy to Indigenous Affairs by Scott Morrison MP, after bungling an attempt at getting his mate Peter Dutton to take over from his arch-nemesis Malcolm Turnbull.

“That’s what you get on the big jobs aye” says the man formerly known as Tony Abbott, but now refuses to go by anything except Tony X, following his rapid transformation into a staunch advocate for radical black nationalism.

After spending a week in prison without charge after being arrested for public nuisance, converting to Islam, and realising that statistically he only has eight more years to live, Uncle Tony X says days like today’s are a good a escape from the easily preventable health issues and systemic racism he faces each day as a proud Northern Beaches elder.

“I just wanna make sure I catch G.I [Souths Sydney Rabbitohs Star Greg Inglis] playing” he said.

“Would love to see how he plays in a proper NSW team, naaah”

“Probably coulda driven out here from Canberra but thought I’d go full Liberal Party ways and get the jet. Let us know if you need a ride cuz [hahaha]”

Peter Dutton Patronisingly Compliments Uncle Tony X For Not Being Like “The Other Ones”

TEXT:

Ahead of making his way to Dubbo for the 2018 Koori Knock Out, Former Prime Minister Uncle Tony X has today been given the ‘white nod’ from his Liberal party colleague, Peter Dutton.

The ‘white nod’ is defined by Oxford Dictionary as the moment in a black person’s life when they become familiar enough with a white person to be dissociated with any prejudices that were previously held against them, in Apartheid South Africa, this cultural glitch was referred to as ‘honorary white status’.

Dutton, who has been too busy lying on a leather couch talking to therapists in the weeks since his cruelly booby-trapped attempt at ousting Malcolm Turnbull, appeared to have missed Uncle Tony’s rapid transformation into radical black nationalism.

“Oh… Are you one of… Are you… umm” asked an uncomfortable Peter Dutton, after noticing Uncle Tony’s Indigenous All Stars cap.

“I must’ve missed this”

The newly-appointed Special Envoy to Indigenous Affairs  took it upon himself to gently educate Dutton on his family’s close ties to Aboriginal Australia, starting from way back in his childhood in a six bedroom mansion in Sydney’s Northern Beaches, followed by his three-decade career in the Liberal Party.

The Minister For Home Affairs responded by telling Uncle Tony that he was surprised to learn of his background, and complimented him for keeping it so well hidden.

“You’re not like those other ones, Tony” he said.

“Haha. When I first found out you were a blackfella I started getting flashbacks to my Queensland Police days”

“I nearly put you in the back of my car and drove you to out Pinkenba to let you walk home”

Millennials Begin Poking Needles Into Vacant Investment Properties To Drive Down House Prices

TEXT:

Struggling first-home-buyers may have found an easy foot into the hyper-inflated Australian property, it has been confirmed.

Mirroring the the damage done to Australian fruit growers over the last fortnight, local millennial, Courtney Fisher (25) has starting randomly poking needles into the plasterboard walls of investment properties in her childhood suburb.

“It’s the only way” she says.

“The negative gearing tax has allowed houses to sit vacant for no reason. It’s pretty much just land-banking, 1 out of 3 houses in my parent’s street are empty… So I’ve started putting needles in them [mwahaha’]” she laughed

“I thought, if a bunch of needles can cripple a market with an actually sustainable level of supply and demand, I should at least give it a crack on one that is manipulated against me”

Courtney is just one of hundreds of thousands of Australians who are currently locked out of the Australian housing market, despite having at least triple the savings her parents did at her age when they were buying houses – on the same wages.

It seems a vast number of fellow first-home-buyers have had a similar idea, with reports that almost half the houses in Australian capital cities were unable to sell over the weekend due to reports of needle contamination.

“We are worried about the affects this will have on the market” said DOMAIN magazine editor, Wyatt Oldguy (66).

“At the worst, this will at encourage homeowners to sell to the first bidder, instead of waiting to sell it to some foreign investor site unseen”

“Dear Men, Think You Can Get Away With Man-Spreading While Alone On Holidays? Think Again”

TEXT:

Haha.. So Mexico has been kinda fun.

For those who don’t read much of my stuff, yeah, I’ve currently spent the last few weeks doing Mexico. Bit of backpacking, bitta hostel living, bitta glamping.

But yeah, still get a couple hours to sit down with the laptop from time to time, and yeah, these guys are still paying me. So yeah, can’t believe they let me write this, but one thing I’ve noticed over here is that men are the same wherever you go around the world.

In fact, I’ve found in Mexico, sometimes they are worse. I’m not sure what it is, I guess it kind of comes down to a poorer standard of living where patriarchal gaffes thrive. Can’t really put my finger on it, but the Catholicism can’t be helping LOL.

Anyway, one thing that I see, everywhere I go, anywhere in the world, is the gender aggressions that filter down through every day mannerisms. Right down to sitting.

Man-spreading, which we thought was kind of not really a thing anymore, is apparently still very much a thing in impoverished regions of central America.

Manspreading or man-sitting or ballrooming is the practice of men sitting in pin view of others with legs wide apart, thereby asserting a kind of intimidating dominance over less-alpha men in the room, and females.

And let me tell you, it’s fucking everywhere over here.

This comes after viral video footage comes to light of a Law student in Russia embarking on a one-woman crusade to stop “manspreading” — by pouring bleach on to the offenders’ crotches.

Anna Dovgalyuk, 20, has accused men in her native Russia of “gender aggression” and says her country is not doing enough the tackle the problem. The video has since been revealed as a fake. But, you know what, I kind of wish it wasn’t.

Maybe some men do need to have their private parts mutilated to figure out that their microaggressions are actually making some people, not just women (me included), feel fucking sick.

But yeah, one thing I’ve notice is that there are a lot of white people over here, who comes to Mexico to just kind of use it as a playground. And while man-spreading has kind of been filtered out of professional environments in developed nations, I see so many of these guys just plopping themselves on beach chairs and getting their spread on.

I could put it down to a ‘when in Rome’ kind of thing. But like, the actual locals here are pretty problematic they way the stoically promote toxic masculinity, so anyone coming from an actually good country would be able to see that it’s probably not a very good idea just mirroring their behaviour.

It shouldn’t matter how much you’ve had to drink, it should matter that you don’t wanna get sand on your feet. The fucking bottom line is that man-spreading, anywhere, is unnacceptable.

And yeah, people are watching.

And yeah, sometimes they’ll shame you by taking a photo.

Like I did.

He lists himself on twitter as a thoughtmaker and journalist, despite only getting published in online publications like this one when we are running low on sponsored content.

Jamies credits his love of dissecting the news, and using political correctness to crucify any writer/actor/comic that is doing better than him, to a gap year spent building poorly designed mud huts in a third world country with a school-counsellor-suggested charity that has since been shut down due to revelations that 90% of donations were spent on useless cunts like him.

With a relatively big twitter following and an elite education at both an inner-city selective school and a demountable arts department in a prominent Sandstone University, Jamies relishes in the fact that at 23, he is much more engaged with problematic societal trends that he never looked twice at a couple years ago when he was still going to NRL matches with his dad.

“It’s Time For Some Balance” Scott Morrison Nominates Mike Baird As New Director Of The ABC

TEXT:

Prime Minister Scott Morrison has today welcomed the resignation of the ABC board chairman Justin Milne, and has finally commented on who should replace the recently sacked director, Michelle Guthries.

“I think it’s fair to say that the ABC is at-risk of becoming an inner-city leftie echo chamber”

Morrison says that by hiring an ex-Murdoch executive as the ABC’s managing director wasn’t enough. Especially when she failed to sack journalists who were holding him accountable for his trickle-down-economics model.

“We need to penetrate the walls of hypercritical, progressive reporting by installing a former Liberal state Premier with close ties to the banking sector” said the Prime Minister.

“It’s deadset the only way we can fix the ABC. It’s either that or one of Rupert Murdoch’s socially challenged nephews I see at Cronulla Northies every now and then”

Baird, who is currently a high-ranking executive for NAB after using the NSW state government as a stepping stone in his career in finance, has said he is interested in the challenge of restructuring the ABC to focus on property speculation and the need for lock-out laws.

“Put it this way. I won’t be sending the four corners team anywhere near the greyhound track [haha]” said Baird.

This comes as embattled chairman Justin Milne has quit after days of chaos and deeply damaging revelations about his conduct.

Justin Milne was not present at an emergency ABC board meeting this morning, which resulted in a request for him to step aside, after a union protest in the lobby of the Ultimo kremlin yesterday afternoon.

The board will meet again at noon to decide on an acting chairman, but Liberal party insiders suggest that Scott Morrison has also made a nomination for that job as well.

“I think John Howard has the time to sit on a few more boards. Let me text him”

Uncle Tony X Tells His Nephews That They’re Distantly Related To Latrell’s Mob

TEXT:

As far as Former Prime Minister Uncle Tony is concerned, Sydney Rooster superstar Latrell Mitchell is basically his own mob.

This revelation comes as the Member For Warringah is forced to pick a side ahead of this weekend’s NRL Grand Final, after his beloved South Sydney Rabbitohs were knocked out in last Saturday’s preliminary final.

Uncle Tony X says while it hurts to throw his support behind the Rabbitoh’s most famous rivals, he can’t really look past how deadly Latrell’s season has been.

“I used to support the Storm when they had Greggy. But now I gotta support my cousin Latrell.” he said, in a new spree of media appearances that has many of his Liberal Party colleagues feeling as though he’s taking his new pity role as Special Envoy to Indigenous Affairs a bit too seriously.

It is believed that has Uncle Tony started exaggerating his family ties to the Sydney Rooster’s centre, especially when talking to the kids.

In fact, he’s gone and told all the nephews that they’re all related to Latrell – possibly untrue claims that the kids will now spend the rest of their lives defending.

“That’s our mob” he told the jarjums.

“Gone then ask your nan. Through his father”

At time of press Uncle Tony X was seen teaching the young ones how to do Latrell’s kangaroo post try celebration.

Bloke Who Ran Over All Those Emus Reportedly Polling Better Than Bill Shorten As Preferred PM

TEXT:

The Running Over Emus And Laughing Party has today increased its two-party-preferred vote by 2% in the latest Newspoll, shooting past Labor’s previous election-winning lead in the wake of the Liberal leadership spill.

The party, lead by a 20-year-old man who deliberately ran down emus in his ute on a country road near the South Australian border last week, has surprised political analysts who thought they wouldn’t be in anyway considered as a preferred Prime Minister, until matched up against Shorten.

The man, 20, was charged with numerous animal cruelty and traffic offences on Friday after the video he filmed of himself running over the emus went viral on social media – but it hasn’t stopped his campaign momentum – as the leader of the opposition continues to be outpolled by some of the most unlikable people in the country.

It is not yet known why the the degenerate animal torturer is even being considered as a Prime Minster, while the RSPCA protesting the The Running Over Emus And Laughing Party’s decision to elect him as their leader.

One month after a toxic three-way leadership contest flipped Australia’s Prime Minister for the third time time since Labor was voted out in 2013, it appears that the emu hit-n-runner boosted their primary vote by 3% to 36% and now sits behind Labor 46% to 54% in two-party-preferred terms.

The result represents a 4.4% swing to Labor since the 2016 election, which would lead to the government losing up to 20 seats if replicated in a general election, but it is the first positive movement towards the disgustingly cruel townie.

When asked for comment Bill Shorten said he’d never run over emus if he ever visited the bush, but was unable to explain why that man was polling better than him.

Emergence Of Mince Pies In Supermarket Heralds Start Of Inner City Leftie’s War On Christmas

TEXT:

“Argh,” he sighed.

“Is it that time of year already?”

In a stunning display of localised indulgent self-loathing, a mildly popular bicycle mechanic took to social media this morning to declare war on Christmas.

Jackson Scullion-Pearson’s casus belli is that unless people hadn’t realised yet, it was 2018 and the notion of Christmas in the country has since become a problem.

Around 9 AM this morning, the 26-year-old penned a Facebook status to his like-minded and carefully cultivated friends list where it garnered a number of likes, shares and comments

“Christmas… in September? This is the second worst September-related thing this year. The first being Taylor Swift’s cover of September by Earth, Wind & Fire. Fuck Off Christmas.”

All responses were positive and supportive of Jackson’s opinion on the matter and he told our reporter that it was nice to have his thoughts and feelings reinforced through the power of social media.

He joined The Advocate at Helen’s Hot Toast opposite the French Quarter føtex to discuss his recent post.

“The fact that so many of my online friends and offline friends liked and commented on my post, telling me that it was right, ultimately means it’s right,” he said.

“And because the post was centred around the Christian holiday of Christmas being problematic, toxic and redundant, it means that Christmas needs to be cancelled this year,”

“But you won’t see it happen. Because this country is fucked.”

Mr Scullion-Pearson then battled the rest of the way through his regular long black before telling our reporter shortly before he left that if he didn’t agree with him, he was wrong.

Out Of Control Bin Fire Somehow Polling Better Than Bill Shorten As Preferred Prime Minister

A blazing pile of rubbish has today increased its two-party-preferred vote by 2% in the latest Newspoll, shooting past Labor’s previous election-winning lead in the wake of the Liberal leadership spill.

It is not yet known why the stinky, smokey pile of burning trash is even being considered as a Prime Minster, while emergency workers unsuccessfully attempt to quell the flames by pouring petrol on it.

The result represents a 4.4% swing to Labor since the 2016 election, which would lead to the government losing up to 20 seats if replicated in a general election, but it is the first positive movement towards the disgustingly pungent and flat out concerning skip bin full of firey trash in some time.

When asked for comment on the worrying poll numbers, Bill Shorten was still talking about the Fatman Scoop video, as it appears to be the only thing that he can honestly say he wouldn’t have done as Prime Minister.

Government Opens First Strawberry Injecting Room Despite Community Backlash

TEXT:

Up to 300 people a day are expected to use Australia’s first medically supervised drug fruit injecting room when it opens in the coming days, in an attempt to minimise harm to the community in response to the ongoing fruit tampering crisis.

More than 100 reports of tampered fruit are being investigated by police across the country, many of which are thought to be fake or copycat cases because the media is treating this whole thing like they are reporting on a school shooting.

The government this week rushed legislation through parliament to ratchet up the maximum penalties for so-called “food terrorists” from 10 to 15 years behind bars.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison wants the tough sanctions approved before federal politicians depart Canberra on Thursday.

However, it appears that retailers are taking matters into their own hands, with supermarkets across the country last night announced a nationwide roll-out of blue lights for all grocery aisles, so to confused offenders looking for somewhere to put a sewing needle.

Shortly after, Boost Juice and their rip-off airport equivalents have also declared plans to temporarily equip staff with sharps disposal bins.

However, with the growing need felt by certain degenerates to put needles in fruit only rising, the Australian Government has had to commit to a two-year trial for fruit injecting rooms at the North Richmond Community Health Centre, after three separate mafia-affiliated greengrocer families called for a supervised space.

Scott Morrison says that while he thinks these people are degenerate grubs, the special needle rooms will save lives.

“I look forward to speaking to less families who have been subject to the needles in their fruit” he said.

“And to all the people that are worried about these injector rooms being near schools, just remember we aren’t 100% convinced that this whole thing hasn’t been kids being kids in the first place”

The centre is made up of different rooms where users are assessed, an injecting space, and treatment and recovery rooms. As well as a deli aisle.

Up to 11 people can use the rooms at once, and based on the rates of use through the centre’s existing needle exchange it is estimated up to 300 people may visit throughout the day.

Russell Crowe Posts Bail For Uncle Tony X Ahead Of Rabbitohs Vs Roosters Preliminary Finals

TEXT:

After a week on remand in Silverwater, Former Prime Minister Uncle Tony X has today finally made bail, after strings were pulled in the South Sydney Rabbitohs headquarters.

Last weekend, the prominent Northern Beaches elder was thrown in gaol after failing to get a taxi home after the South Sydney Rabbitohs historic win against the St George Illawarra Dragons.

However, activist groups have worked hard to free Uncle Tony, who was awaiting charge for public nuisance and a log of unpaid parking fines, for fear that he might suffer punctured internal organs and die in custody, as Indigenous Australians are 18 times more likely to.

Today’s news comes quite welcome to the Member Of Warringah, who’s come to experience many of the hurdles faced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders since his appointment as the Special Envoy to Indigenous Affairs to the Morrison Government.

These hurdles include constant police profiling, preventable health issues – and the expectation to be a bunnies supporter.

The latter, while considered an ailment to many Australians, has actually come as a saving grace for the Former Prime Minister after he was bailed out of prison this morning thanks to the intervention of a powerful figure from deep within the South Sydney Rabbitohs.

Rabbitohs owner Russell Crowe is believed to have posted the $1m bail required for Uncle Tony to await trial outside of prison.

Sources close to the Gladiator star say Uncle Tony X will be arriving in a helicopter at tonight’s match between the Rabbitohs and their long-time rivals, the Sydney Roosters. Providing he doesn’t do a runner.

Friday Arvo: Bloke Who Just Found A Needle In His Schooner Keeps Very Fucken Quiet

TEXT:

In some breaking news out of the town’s Old City District, Kelvin Brooks has managed to avert a major situation this afternoon.

The engineer was enjoying a couple of Friday afternoon drinks with some mates down at a local pub today when he felt a prick in his mouth.

Letting out a sharp breath, Brooks felt a strong pain stabbing into his cheek.

However, rather than drawing the attention of the group to himself, the quick-witted young man took a couple of seconds to regain his composure and process the situation.

Across the week that was in the news, Brooks had a fair inclination as to what had just transpired.

Quickly rising from his seat the Ponds local quickly darted into the bathroom to inspect what he suspected to be in his mouth.

Spitting out a small amount of blood tainted saliva, Brooks pulled from his mouth a small sewing needle.

In full realization about what could go down if he made a song and dance, Brooks’ instincts kicked in.

Glancing around the empty bathroom, he quickly smuggled the needle into one of the bins and began rinsing his mouth out.

Understanding the gravity of the situation Brooks brushed his face with water and walked back out to the group to continue on his merry way.

After finishing his schooner and getting the round he was due for, he peeled off for a short amount of time to speak to our reporters, briefly explaining why he kept everything under wraps.

“I have had a fucking week. Honestly, the Project Engineer was riding me like a prized pony. If I kicked up a fuss about finding a little needle in my beer. Jesus, it would have just been a nightmare,” he said.

“Bar staff would have been running around, police called, everyone making a scene. I just wanna enjoy a couple of cold ones with some of my friends. Not create national headlines.”

“It did fucking hurt though. The inside of my mouth is real sore. Whoever put the needle in there is a right spoon, but I’m not giving him the satisfaction.”

African Teenagers Enjoying Brief Break From Being Stigmatised By Herald Sun During AFL Finals

TEXT:

As Melbourne, and a bit of Western Australia, find themselves entranced in the pointy end of the 2018 AFL season – the hysterical white noise of the game’s heartbreaks and Cinderella stories have filled all the gaps usually found in a slow news week.

While most of the Southerners are relishing in the chance to read about nothing but their beloved game for the next week or so, there are some people that really, really don’t want it to end.

In fact, there are some that would love to live their rest of their lives in a purgatory of hysterical media speculation surrounding which football team is the best.

Mainly, Melbourne’s African Community.

The Betoota Advocate spoke to two year-12 students from one of those Melbourne suburbs that don’t have trams or alleyways with murals in them.

Graham* and Cheryl* [names changed] say that while they are excited to see who wins this year’s 2018 AFL Toyota Premiership, they are also terrified about what will happen to their families when the news cycle slows down again.

“We only get a couple months a year to just go about our lives without being painted as violent home invading car-jacking rapists” says Cheryl*

“We’ve had a couple bi-elections down here this year and a lot of politicians with not much to talk about. The football is great for distracting people from the media’s narrative that every 6 foot black kid is an organised crime figure”

Graham says that during this time of the year, he only gets stares from old white people that want him to start playing AFL.

“During September, it’s all about whether or not I can jump and kick footballs. When it’s a slow news week, it’s all about whether I’m gonna jump the elderly and kick their heads”

“As long as the AFL is heating up, then we don’t get Peter Dutton threatening to deport our entire community based off something that he reckons he heard from someone”

Uncle Tony X Converts To Islam While In Prison

TEXT:

Former Prime Minister Uncle Tony Abbott has today backflipped on his previous comments about Muslim ideology, after being introduced to the teachings of the Koran by his cellmate, Spider.

This comes after the newly-appointed Special Envoy to Indigenous Affairs, Uncle Tony X was jailed without a trial on Saturday evening, on the charge of being out in public while Indigenous.

It is believed the Member Of Warringah was picked up by members of the NSW Police Force and taken straight to the watchhouse, after being unable to hail a cab home from the Rabbitohs v St George Semi-Finals clash.

While in jail since Saturday night it is believed that Uncle Tony X has been forced to navigate his way his way through the racially segregated inmate hierarchy, eventually opting to join his  black brothers in the prison yard, instead of the white supremacist skinheads who had also greeted him with a warm welcome.

“I chose to sit with my black brothers, call it a cultural coming of age, call it a backbencher taking his new special envoy role to seriously, call it what you will.”

Aside from the record-breaking overrepresentation of Indigenous inmates within Australia’s prison system, Uncle Tony X says he has been relishing in how incarceration has gifted him with the chance to experience a much more accurate cross-section of Australian demographics than his whitebread home electorate.

The Former Prime Minister’s incarceration is believed to have resulted in him exploring new ideas of faith and religion, as he continues his well-documented journey into the politics of radical black nationalism.

Prison insiders say that in the last 24-hours, Uncle Tony X has converted to Islam.

Burning to know more about his faith, The Member For Warringah has begun a campaign to improve his reading and writing. After copying an entire dictionary page-by-page, he has read every book the prison library had in philosophy, history, literature, and science.

Speaking to Betoota Advocate through a contraband mobile phone smuggled in by Vietnamese inmates in the same block, Uncle Tony says he has finally found peace in the religion he spent so many years stigmatising through race-baiting and sensationalism while Prime Minister.

“Days have passed without my even thinking about being imprisoned. In fact, up till now, I had never been so truly free in my life.” said the Former Prime Minister.

“Nobody can give you freedom, nobody can give you equality or justice. If you are a man, you take it.”

PM Says Uncle Tony May Lose Pre-Selection If He Doesn’t Stand For Anthem At Bunnies Match

TEXT:

A bold protest will hang over the South Sydney Rabbitohs as they attempt to keep their NRL premiership dreams alive in tonight’s semi-final against the St George Illawarra Dragons.

This comes as former Prime Minister, and recent Bunnies die-hard Uncle Tony Abbott tweeted his support for Harper Nielsen, the 9-year-old Australian schoolgirl who refused to stand during the singing of the national anthem at assembly out of respect for the Indigenous population.

In a frenzy of since deleted tweets, The Member For Warringah and newly appointed Special Envoy to Indigenious Affairs said the young Brisbane girl should be proud of her actions, and that he will be doing the same before today’s match.

”Too black, too strong! ✊🏾” tweeted Uncle Tony.

”That anthem means nothing to me or my people. I’ll be kneeling like a motherfucka”

However Prime Minister Morrison has made it clear that Uncle Tony will face severe repercussions if he refuses to stand during the National Anthem between the two iconic rugby league clubs with historical ties to the Indigenous community.

”When I gave him this job, I didn’t think he’d actually do anything with it” said the new Prime Minister.

”I worry that he had taken his role as an ambassador for the rights of black people too far. There is even whispers that he has joined the Nation Of Islam”

”The Member For Warringah ought to think carefully before he stages any protests at today’s football match. If he doesn’t stand, I’ll pull that son of a bitch off the field”

Morrison’s comments follow the news that Uncle Tony has been controversially re-endorsed as the Liberal party candidate for the Sydney northern beaches seat of Warringah after a branch meeting on Friday night.

Abbott stood unopposed, and was chosen, despite angry grumblings from at least 30% of grassroots Liberal members, who appear to have taken a disliking to his “black armband view of Australian history”.

Uncle Tony has since accused his colleagues of ’whitesplaining’ issues they don’t understand.

Prime Minister Morrison’s Media Advisor Now Looking For Work In Advertising

TEXT:

Following a nightmarish 24-hours on social media, the millennial Liberal staffer responsible for Prime Minister Morrison’s ‘Fatman Scoop’ video meme, has popped up on LinkedIn looking for work in the advertising sector.

The new Prime Minister’s Media advisor has enjoyed an even shorter tenure than some of the men and women before him.

Just weeks into his exciting and career-defining role as the Media Advisor to the top job in the country, poor Phil Barnard is now looking for work in a creative agency today.

The 29-year-old go-getter who’s always prided himself on having a finger on the pulse has been asked to put his things in a box after a couple of blunders in the past 24 hours.

The marketing graduate from a sandstone university has put his boss and the entire office under fire today for deciding to put a questionable video up on the PM’s Twitter Account.

The video features Prime Minister Morrison and his colleagues putting their hands up to the iconic 2001 Fatman Scoop song ‘Be Faithful,’ and the caption ‘QT was on fire today (fire emoji).’

The song which goes on to ask ‘Who Fucking Tonight,’ and whether anyone who’d be interested in some ‘sex with no strings attached,’ forced the PM to offer an official apology for the post.

With poor Barnard’s job teetering along a fine line, the young man then followed up with a congratulatory post for Dave Sharma, the new candidate selected for the Liberals in the seat of Wentworth.

However, he congratulated ‘David Sharma,’ not Dave, which is short for Devanand.

The PM’s Chief of Staff spoke to us moments ago explaining why poor old Barnard was going to have head to an agency where they play squash at lunchtime and Friday afternoon beers are compulsory.

“Look don’t get me wrong, Be Faithful’s a fucking track. Everyone rates it. But you can’t go putting that up on the PM’s account,” the Chief of Staff said.

“We were thinking about punishing him and making him use an iPhone 5 for a couple of months and letting him keep his job, but then he fucked up again the poor fella, so it’s off to some ambiguous sounding agency where they all wear skinny jeans and fresh runners.”

Australian Strawberries ‘Find A Golden Needle’ Campaign Backfires

TEXT:

Strawberries Australia is ducking for cover today after being plastered for their latest promotional campaign.

In a spectacular marketing ploy, the peak Strawberries body has faced heavy criticism for it’s ‘Find A Golden Needle To Tour The Strawberry Factory’ competition that has made headlines.

This comes after people around the country have sighted sewing needles inside their strawberries, with one man hospitalised after swallowing half a needle.

The backlash has been severe, with commentators and the general public questioning what Australian Strawberries were thinking.

In an official statement sent to The Betoota Advocate this morning, the body’s chief William Stronka explained that they really wanted to make a statement with their new campaign this year.

“We thought strawberry eaters might have been excited about the exciting tour that we are offering at our weird, wonderful and magical strawberry factory,” Stronka said.

“However, instead of jumping for joy and grasping the golden needles, everyone is complaining and some people have gone to hospital.”

Stronka explained that while the campaign has received a lot of negative attention, the incredible tour is still available.

“We encourage those who discovered our needles to please still come and explore our factory. The Strawbavator is an incredible contraption, and the Everlasting Strawberry will blow your mind,” he said.

The head of Strawberries Australia did confirm that next year they might just stick to promoting the fact that strawberries are super cheap around this time of year because of a product glut.

“Lives and learns aye.”

Uncle Tony Appears On Today Show To Condemn Mark Knight’s Gammin Cartoons

TEXT:

Former Prime Minister Uncle Tony Abbott has today responded with shock and disgust over a cartoon depiction of tennis star Serena Williams which he has labelled “racist” and “sexist” – and worst of all “gammin”.

The image by Australian cartoonist Mark Knight has created uproar in the US with commentators saying it is an example of Australia’s “blind racism” and people elsewhere in the Australia pointing out it’s a prime example of how Melbourne think they are so woke when they are actually just rednecks with scarves.

The furore comes as Knight, a respected cartoonist with Melbourne-based newspaper The Herald Sun, deleted his Twitter account and the paper doubled down on the cartoon with an editorial front page attacking political correctness.

“Welcome to PC World,” the headline reads, accompanied by a “Satire Free Zone” stamp in the foreground.

However, Uncle Tony Abbott has since appeared on Channel Nine’s Today Show, to condemn what he believes has been a history of racist cartoons by a wine-drunk migaloo tucked away in his Collingwood terrace house.

“He drew a very unflattering cartoon of me when I first got the Special Envoy job” said Abbott.

“Made me wild”

Uncle Tony Abbott then took a moment to adjust his Aboriginal flag-coloured headband, before issuing the final blow.

Georgie Binney, a local interior designer from Betoota’s Old City District, has today informed the world that she’s moving on from the six-months of emotional turmoil that resulted in her breaking up with her long-term boyfriend Benny.

“Oh it looks great, babe” says Georgia’s close friend, and increasingly worried bystander to this quarter-life crisis.

“You really pull it off”

While Georgie continues to talk a big game of quitting her job and going travelling for a year, the dramatic new hairstyle appears to be enough for now.

The fact that Georgie didn’t even use the opportunity to raise money for charity suggests that shaving her head was an impulse decision while mildly hungover on Saturday morning.

However, this new look, paired with an intense month-long regime at a local high-intensity interval training gym, has completely overshadowed the relationship dramas – that many believe are still ongoing, due to the fact she’s constantly leaving the room to take phone calls.

Peter Dutton Appears In Controversial New Advertising Campaign For The Herald Sun

TEXT:

“Believe that people in Melbourne are too scared to go to restaurants. Even if it means sacrificing everything.” reads the billboards currently plastered around Melbourne’s outer suburbs.

It comes as Victorian masthead, The Herald Sun, decided to energise its “Just Read It” motto by using the face of Peter Dutton, the former Immigration Minister known as one of the first politicians to blindly reference the newspaper’s opinion columns during press conferences.

The polarising campaign has led to a drop in the newspapers shares, but the social media storm it provoked remains a marketing hit with people who instinctively hate and fear black people.

The new advertisements are directly referencing comments made by Peter Dutton earlier in the year where he stated that people in Melbourne are too scared to go out to restaurants, due to Sudanese teenagers loitering in the streets while being black, and sometimes even hooded.

“What we want is for people to know that it’s alright to read and believe everything in our newspapers, even if it ruins your dash for the job of Prime Minister” said one editor.

“The left wing, and moderate, and even some right-wing commentators will say that what you are saying is incorrect, and the police can present their own statistics that are completely contradicting to what you are saying…”

“but it takes a bold man to get up there and say these things based off what rich old media commentators believe is happening in the streets of Melbourne”

The ‘unashamedly conservative’ newspaper and it’s writers have moved quickly to protect their newspaper from a boycott in the working class suburbs. This follows the intense criticisms and backlash directed towards the NewsCorp’s Sydney-based syndicate, The Daily Telegraph, who decided to send higher-than-thou reporters to photograph the Mad Monday celebrations of drunken rugby league players earlier this week.

The Herald Sun says that while they face similar backlash for race-baiting everyday Australians with warped statistics about rates of crime amongst African teenagers, they want the people that don’t live in inner-Melbourne to know it’s fine to believe what they read.

“It’s our duty to report kind of twisted and sensationalised news about immigrants to the people of Victoria, and we want people to know it’s okay to believe the shit we write, even if it fucks your whole career” said one bold NewsCorp marketing executive.

Occasionally, the bus driver will give him that ‘I-didn’t-see-anything’ nod when his GoCard declines on the bus to work.

And sometimes, he’ll pony up the confidence to steal $30 worth of seafood from a local big two supermarket.

“I’ve just gotta find out what veggies are selling for the cheapest” he says.

“It’s usually carrots, or unwashed potatoes”

But today, it’s brown onions.

While being served by an equally financially-locked-out and apathetic millennial working in the deli, Jackson boldly asks for a Christmas-day-sized serving of prawns.

“Yep” he says confidently, like an actual adult who owns property and has a decent private health fund.

“No. The most expensive ones. That’s the ones I want to buy today”

The deli worker, who probably knows what he’s up to, but doesn’t care because she also can’t afford to drink more than three schooners a weekend outside her weekly budget as metropolitan renter, gives him a kilo and a half, but charges for just a kilo.

Between the counter and the self-checkout, Jackson scoops up a 5-pack of 2 minute udon so as to not look suspicious, and peels off the barcode sticker from the deli.

Tony Abbott Starts Supporting The Rabbitohs And Calling Female Colleagues ‘Sis’

TEXT:

After days of hesitation, former prime minister Tony Abbott has drastically changed his conversational vernacular and begun wearing as much red, black and yellow jewellery as possible.

This comes after the Member for Warringah gave a conditional yes to taking on the job of the Federal Government’s Indigenous envoy.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison did not ask Mr Abbott to be a minister in his new Government, but instead asked him to take on the role of envoy, citing his close association with Aboriginal Australia after growing up in a six bedroom mansion in Sydney’s Northern Beaches and working for the Liberal Party for nearly three decades.

Earlier in the week and before any of the details of the job had become public, Mr Abbott appeared reluctant, saying he needed to know the precise terms of what was being proposed.

However, it appears that Abbott has decided to embrace the new non-cabinet pity role, and has immediately started supporting the South Sydney Rabbitohs, as well as referring to all of his female colleagues as ‘sis’.

“Gagai got some heat behind him this year, true god” he told our reporters.

As is common with white public servants employed in the Aboriginal And Torres Strait Islander services sector, Tony Abbott has begun being quite vague about his ancestral background, and relishes in the opportunity to say things like ‘deadly’ and ‘look out!’.

“I’ve handed out Koori flag lapels in the office, just so my staffers can remember which side they are on. Some of them actually need it. Shame job” Abbott told our reporters.

At the conclusion of our interview, Abbott was seen asking our olive-skinned camera operator who his “mob” was.

Malcolm Turnbull Quits Parliament And Boards One Way Flight To Cayman Islands

Departing Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has thrown the towel in today, announcing that he is quitting parliament, and has called the second leadership spill this week. 

After digging his heels in for most of the week, Turnbull finally called the meeting to decide the next Prime Minister of the country, after receiving a letter with 43 signatures on it asking for the conference. 

The meeting will feature a leadership spill, with Julie Bishop, Peter Dutton and Scott Morrison all throwing their hats in the ring for the top gong. 

It can now be confirmed that Turnbull has sensationally announced that he will be quitting parliament, effective immediately to head to the Caymans. 

In an exclusive interview with The Advocate over the phone a short time ago, outgoing Prime Minister Turnbull revealed to us that he is about to get on a one-way flight to the Cayman Islands. 

“Yeah, I’m done. Fuck this, I’m out of here. I’m not hanging around to serve under a highway cop who has got the elocution of a highway cop,” Turnbull said over the phone. 

“Besides, all my bank accounts and finances are set up over in the Caymans, so it’s the perfect fit. I’ll head over there, lay low for a year or so, kick the feet up, and think about heading back to Wall Street to ply my trade.” 

“A private jet is waiting for me and I’ll be heading out of Sydney this afternoon. Enjoy the next few months. Bye bye,” he said before the line went dead.

Liberal Party Self-Immolates

TEXT:

The Liberal Party of Australia have today performed a very shocking act of self-immolation, in protest against the difficulties of running a unified government in 2018.

The act of self-immolation, or setting one’s self on fire, was brought on by the Former Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton and his band of old white conservative supporters.

This comes after news broke that Peter Dutton wants another bite at the cherry, and tried to force a second leadership spill this afternoon.

After wounding the leader he publicly said he supported for months, the former Sunshine Coast Highway Cop has set fire to the entire party this week.

In a move that has Opposition Leader Bill Shorten and the Australian Labor Party licking their lips, Malcolm Turnbull has had to concede that it’s all over for him now, and acknowledge that he will have to call a meeting tomorrow as the public and embarrassing disintegration of the Liberal Party continues.

The petty games being played by the federal politicians paid 6 figure salaries to represent the people of Australia, has resulted in the entire country, regardless of which side they support shaking their head in disbelief.

Dutton, the man who walked out on the National Apology to The Stolen Generations, and has made it his purpose in life to make life hard for brown people wanting to enter the country, said that Murdoch columnists and anti-abortion MP’s in Coalition have assured him that this is what the people of Australia want.

Malcolm Turnbull refused to give an official statement but told our reporters over the phone that he has  “had enough.”

Bachelor Ratings Crash As Federal Politics Provides More Irrational Conflict And Petty Drama

TEXT:

It was a bad night for soon to be former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and an even worse one for Channel Ten. 

With the nation’s attention being held to ransom by the Coalition Government’s leadership debacle, one of the station’s flagship reality programs suffered a massive hit. 

The much hyped and anticipated season of the Bachelor, featuring the most ockered up version of the Nick ‘The Honey Badger’ Cummins, had pulled huge numbers last week averaging 1.25 million viewers on its launch night. 

However, the numbers took a big whack last night as the nation’s viewers decided more irrational conflict and petty drama could be found on the nation’s news channels, with ABC News24 drawing large numbers. 

Channel Ten’s Head of Programming Hugh Burke told The Advocate that if things keep going the way they are, they are just going to pull tonight’s episode. 

“It will be pointless putting on the air. No one will be watching. We will just save it till next week when all these pollies go on holiday.” 

Local Bachelor fan Alison Little told The Advocate that she knew the news channels were the place to be for gossiping, blowups and mindless drama. 

“Look I love watching the Bachie in order to see wanna-be-famous Insta models with lip filler tee off on each other over the most nonsensical things, but I knew it wouldn’t compare to what’s going on down in the bush capital,” she explained. 

“It’s so good. Embarrassing for us as a country but still so good. It’s like they don’t even care about running the country anymore, they just want to have tiffs about whose side they are on.” 

“You know what they should do? They should get Keira down there! That would really spice things up,” Little laughed.

Report: Politicians Are Fucking Losers

TEXT:

Malcolm Turnbull’s Prime Ministership remains vulnerable after several senior ministers offered their resignations overnight, and reports more fucking losers Liberals are switching allegiances to Peter Dutton.

This follows a new report by the University of Western Queensland that all politicians in both state and federal politics, and quite often local politics, are the biggest losers in their community.

The report also found anyone that aspires to be a politician before the age of 20 is actually a lost cause and the reason that everyone hates these useless fucks.

Two fucking losers you’ve probably never heard of, Health Minister Greg Hunt and Trade Minister Steve Ciobo are the latest frontbenchers to offer their resignations, but they have not been accepted.

The former fucking loser for Immigration, Mr Dutton continues to keep pressure on the fucking loser Prime Minister by refusing to rule out another challenge, with his supporters saying one is likely at some stage in the future.

Another five fucking loser junior ministers have also offered their resignations, creating a reshuffle headache for Turnbull, the fucking loser, should he accept their offers.

It is not yet known what is next for the Liberal Party as the fucking loser backbenchers hysterically tread water and rapidly changing who they think will be the right leader to help them win back their seats in the next election and remain on $200k per year – the only real incentive for becoming a politician in Australia, aside from the pension and possibility to be corrupt.

Liberal Backbenchers Terrified They Might Have To Send Their Kids To Local Public Schools

TEXT:

It can be confirmed today that the fear of God is in the heart of the Liberal Party backbenchers.

The motley crew of middle-aged white men and a few white women are freaking out that if things keep going the way they are, their children may have to pay the ultimate price.

The ultimate price being forced to send their kids down to the grubby local public schools with all the ragtag snotty working class kids, in their electorate.

With the leadership of the Coalition in disarray, and things looking dicey for a lot of MP’s at the next election, The Advocate has exclusively been informed that a high number of Libs and Nats are willing to do whatever it takes to stay in power.

One backbencher, who requested anonymity explained that they have come together this afternoon to try and figure out the best way to hold onto their jobs.

Sitting in the beer garden of ‘The Snouts in The Trough’ down in the capital the source said: “Dutton, Turnbull, Morrison? None of us really give a fuck who is in charge, as long as they win the next election and we get to hold onto our seats.”

“Policy is great in practice and all, but at the end of the day we have to have a priorities right, and that’s keeping our kids away from polo shirt style uniforms and Rugby League,” he said.

“So we have had a meeting today to try and figure out who is going to be the most electable leader going forward,” he said before leaving a half-finished glass of Pinot Noir at the table and telling us he had to go.

“No one is thinking about our welfare. We’ve got bills and big houses and lifestyles we have become acquainted with. I’m not going to get a real job” said one backbencher.

Bill Shorten Begins Studying Videos Of Steven Bradbury’s 2002 Olympic Gold Medal Win

TEXT:

Malcolm Turnbull has beaten Peter Dutton 48-35 in a snap Liberal leadership spill. The Prime Minister forced his rival to show his hand by declaring all leadership positions vacant as soon as the party room meeting started this morning.

Mr Turnbull won the vote and his deputy Julie Bishop was the only candidate for her role. But the result is so narrow it is set to create ongoing problems for the Government, and the fact that nearly half the party want the Minister For Home Affairs is a fair indicator of a definite loss at next Federal election.

Mr Dutton has since volunteered his resignation from the cabinet, and will remain in the back bench for the next couple months where he will throw peanuts at the Prime Minister until it is time for another spill, which he will most likely win.

Some Liberals also expect other frontbenchers to quit the Ministry, which would cause a major reshuffle.

In the meanwhile, Opposition leader Bill Shorten can’t believe the sure bet he’s been handed, and has decided to just shut the fuck up and smile until he is handed the role of Prime Minister at the next federal election.

“Sounds like a good idea to me” Shorten said to reporters today.

“I’m not going to say or do anything until after the election”

“I’ve been studying videos of Stephen Bradbury’s 2002 Gold Medal win at the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics all morning.”

“This election will be quite possibly the only other example of someone actually winning because of a tortoise and the hare type competitive edge”

DNA Test Finds Bob Katter To Be Distant Cousins With Barking Man From A Current Affair

TEXT:

Following an immediate DNA test conducted by the recently repaired ABC Fact Checker, answers regarding Bob Katter’s alleged Venetian-Semetic-Aboriginal-Lebanese-Irish-Catholic ancestry remain still as muddy as they were during his 10 minute press conference in Cairns on Wednesday.

During his lengthy, at times irrelevant and borderline incoherent rant regarding his newly inaugurated Senator Fraser Anning’s comments about putting forward a plebiscite on which types of people get to migrate to Australia, Bob Katter denied all affiliation with Lebanon, the country his grandaddy migrated from before moving to Western Queensland.

As was reported two days ago, several other comments made by Katter, including his claims that Cairns was founded by Jewish people, and that Fraser Anning was not racist, reportedly resulted in an workplace fire at the ABC office in Ultimo – after their official Fact Checker exploded under severe pressure.

The subsequent DNA test has provided very little clarity about Katter’s DNA, other than backing up his own claims that he is dark and from Cloncurry.

However, one notable finding suggested that Katter was a distant cousin of that old codger that blew up about his neighbour’s dog on A Current Affair a few years back.

Dubbed ‘The Barking Man’ – it is believed that both he and Bob Katter are cousins through their pioneer ancestors in the Queensland Gulf Country.

Analysts say this explains Bob Katter’s explosive press conferences, and inability to finish an interview with making gruff barking sounds and scaring the fuck out of everyone.

“I welcome him to my family” said Bob Katter, during a two hour phone call with our intern earlier today, most of which was spent talking about crocodile attacks and draconian firearm laws.

“He sounds like a great Australian, I might nominate him for pre-selection in Clive’s old seat”

Bono Still Taking Up Space In iPhone Like A Fuckwit

TEXT:

A recent report by people who have opened up their Music folder in the last year has found that U2 are still sitting in there without permission.

“For fuck’s sake” says one iPhone user, Bridie (24), who walks at the Betoota Cobb & Co liquor outlet.

“I haven’t ever liked this band. This better not be taking up memory space. How the fuck do I delete it”

The philanthropic Northern Irish/Irish rockstar and frontman Bono still claims to have no regrets about the free release of U2’s last album on iTunes — despite a huge backlash over the stunt.

The Dublin rockers released their 14th album, Songs of Experience, the follow-up to 2014’s Songs of Innocence, in a weird as fuck marketing move that automatically embedded them into everyone’s phone, whether they liked it or not.

“I’m still so off it” says another local, Damien, a local soundcloud rap enthusiast studying finance at the University of Western Queensland’s Betoota campus.

The rediscovery of this controversial album comes after U2’s most recent tour to Betoota was cancelled after poor ticket sales, with locals stating that if they wanted to see them perform live, they would have just waited until the band broke into their private residences and started playing for free.

GBRF Announce Plans To Spend $444 Million Painting All The Coral Pretty Colours Again

TEXT:

The Great Barrier Reef Foundation (GBRF) has revealed today what they plan to do with the $444 million dollar grant they have been given.

Anna Marsden, the Managing Director of the GBRF, an organisation shadow directed by mining companies, sat down with The Betoota Advocate for an exclusive interview.

After receiving the largest ever non-profit grant in the nation’s history, the 6 employee strong organisation has grand plans.

Despite being slammed from all sides, including by Michael Myer, a member of the Myer Dynasty who was a financial donor and board member until he quit because of the corporate agenda the organisation was driving, the GBRF says that the funding will be well spent.

“Look, I understand some people might be confused about a shady organisation getting the better part of half a billion dollars in funding when the CSIRO is being punished to death by a thousand cuts,” Marsden said.

“But, we have a great initiative that I am really pleased to announce. We will be hiring a handful of divers to go and paint all of the dead coral that has been bleached!”

“How goods that hey? We are working with a couple of scientists to develop an underwater paint that can last up to 20 years a coat, so future generations won’t miss out,” she said.

The Advocate contacted Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull about the grant, and he explained that he has been given assurances that the money won’t be going to waste.

“Yes $444 is over half of the CSIRO’s annual funding of roughly 800 million. But I met with the GBRF and their 6 part-time employees who are so generously donating their time between boardroom meetings for at the Adani offices in Eagle street”

“I believe they will be able to achieve so much more than the 5,500 people working at our country’s flagship science organisation.”

“So put that in your newspaper,” he said.

Sky News Admits It Was ‘Wrong’ To Air Interview With Serial Backpacker Murderer Ivan Milat

TEXT:

After a heavy backlash from viewers, Sky News Australia says it was wrong to air an interview with convicted serial killer and current inmate at Goulburn Supermax, Ivan Milat.

The former Belanglo State Forest-based road worker was invited onto the Adam Giles Show for a studio interview and spoke with the former Northern Territory chief minister about protecting countries against “foreign ideologies” – that come with 457 visa-holders and other types of backpackers.

Within hours of the interview going to air and being shared on various Sky News social media platforms, the channel removed the interview from its repeat timeslots and online platforms.

Stopping short of an apology, news director Greg Byrnes said, “It was wrong to have Ivan Milat on Sky News Australia” and that “his views do not reflect ours”.

The decision to have Milat on the channel was widely criticised, with Sky News political reporter Laura Jayes criticising her own channel.

She said Milat, a “self-confessed serial murderer” was not the “arguably good bloke” the program labelled him as — a sentiment echoed by Sky political editor David Speers.

Milat said the decision was Sky News caving to “Leftist abuse”.

“I suppose my ideas are so irrefutable, that the only recourse is to sentence me to seven consecutive life sentences and stop putting me on TV like I’m a normal media commentator” he tweeted from phone smuggled into his cell by one of his nephews.

Fairly Standard Quarter Life Crisis Put Down To ‘Toxic People’

TEXT:

A local Betoota woman who doesn’t like her job, is having a pretty textbook falling out with a few of her girlfriends, and is still reeling from a bit of a messy break up, has decided that all of her woes come down to the fact that she has too many toxic people in her life.

Christina Moffat (24) says she’s unlike anyone else she knows, in that she allows selfish people to be around her, and like, take but not give.

“I’m just, you know, pretty tired of doing so much for everyone else” she says to her loyal but probably third-tier best friend, Sasha.

“It’s like, I give dedicate so much energy to looking after people like Jason and Gab, and Katie… and like they don’t give anything back”

While many of her friends and family think Christina’s current quarter-life crisis could arguably be a result of boredom, while she sits in an office cubicle in a job she just sort of landed in, with the added salt of seeing Instagram stories all of her friends on holidays in sunny destinations – that’s not the narrative she’s decided to run with.

“Jason is like already seeing other people. It’s so typical of him to do that. He’s a bit toxic”

“Katie and Gab are the same, they basically met through me and now they are in Europe on holidays together”

“I just don’t need toxic people like that in my life”

Turnbull Accidentally Hugs Own Staffer After Mistaking Her For Generic Akubra-Wearing Farmer

TEXT:

In great news for drought-stricken farmers, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has dusted off the old Akubra and made his way west of the Sydney Fish Markets for the first time since Barnaby Joyce’s frenzied by-election win.

But this time, it wasn’t to help ensure Barnaby Joyce was gainfully employed before he revealed to the world that he had a bun in the oven, it was to witness the dire conditions and hardship in many farming communities.

Mr Turnbull on Sunday promised to do more to help those under intense financial strain due to relentless drought conditions, signing off on emergency “special” payments for eligible farmers, to be made through the Farm Household Allowance (FHA) scheme.

During the emotional announcement, Malcolm Turnbull was quick to find an agriculturalist within arms reach to hug for the cameras.

After making a move for his own Minister for Agriculture, David Littleproud MP, Turnbull was met with a “no no no no!” as Littleproud pointed to his clean hat. A common way for politicians to identify themselves when out bush.

The Prime Minister then side-stepped Littleproud and went for an embrace with the next person he saw, a regionally-aesthetic junior Liberal Party staffer named Amy – who he didn’t recognise due to her Akubra and drizabone jacket.

As the camera’s flashed, Amy whispered to the Prime Minister, identifying herself as in fact a member of his own entourage.

“Ok” said Turnbull.

“Just be natural. I’ll pull out of this embrace with a few tears. The last thing we want these bushies thinking is that I’ve pulled a Barnaby”

Turnbull’s announcement will provide households up to $12,000 in additional lump-sum payments for couples. Single households will get $7,200.

The first payment will be made on the first day of next month. The second payment would be made on March 1, next year. The package will also include extra funding for mental health support, and is costing $190 million in total.

Farmers are being encouraged to take the money and stop being too proud because this is what it’s there for.

Office Worker Too Proud To Admit The Standing Desk Thing Was Just A Phase

TEXT:

Just over a month ago city worker, Claire Oakden, kicked up quite a stink in the office around the negative health problems associated with sitting desks, so much so that HR felt obliged to buy her a standing desk.

Now, a mere month after Claire’s ‘sitting is the new smoking’ tirade, cracks are starting to appear in her holier-than-thou demeanour.

“Oh no, I love my standing desk. I am the only one taking their health seriously here” she said while cracking open an energy drink at 8am.

However, sources close to the Advocate can reveal that Claire has in fact been spotted sitting down around the office for long periods of time. When questioned about this by our reporter, Claire vehemently denied it.

“What? No! Sitting? Oh, I must have been in a meeting, I sit in those because it would be weird if I was standing while they weren’t, you know?”

“No, I definitely wasn’t sitting, I stand, I am better than everyone else that is all”.

Unfortunately for Claire, our sources have photographic evidence of her cheating the standing desk system.

One co-worker snapped a photo of Claire kneeling on a stool while still at her standing desk, it’s understood that she positioned the stool in the precise position it needed to be to give the impression that she is still standing.

Despite being shown these photos, Claire is still denying it. After doing some further digging, the Advocate can confirm that she is a Taurus, which explains why she’s being so stubborn and unreasonable.

First Night On The Piss After Dry July Big Enough To Undermine Health Benefits Of Dry July

TEXT:

The last 31 days spent not touching any grog were all for nothing, it has been confirmed.

That’s according to local accountant and prominent boozehound, Kylie Reid (30) who recently undertook the gruelling month-long abstinence from alcohol.

The third of August marked the first Friday arvo drinks that Kylie had taken part in since the start of July, meaning she had had actually done more like 34 days off the piss.

“I was absolutely tongueing for one” she says.

“In a way that construction workers say they are on Friday arvo drinks. It was deep within my bones, I just needed to get extremely groggy”

Dry July is a not-for-profit organisation that challenges people to abstain from drinking alcohol for the month of July to support adults living with cancer across Australia and New Zealand. In contemporary Australian culture, people seen to have raised money while continuing to drink during July are considered ‘dogs’ and ‘cowards’.

However, despite being honest about completing Dry July and raising over $202 dollars (mostly donated by her parents who just want her to settle down) – Kylie has undermined all the health benefits that come with taking a month off.

“I drank from 5pm to 5am” she says.

“I had a few friends in the same boat. We ate a pub meal at around 7pm and then KFC at around 4am”

Lying in bed this morning, Kylie says she’s terrified she may have taken up smoking again last night and is considering taking another month off.

“As of Monday, I reckon” she says.

“I’m meeting the girls at the pub in about an hour”

Police Launch Investigation To Find The Dog Who Tried To Set Up Bryan Fletcher

Detectives from the New South Wales Police Major Crimes Unit have launched an investigation into a video that surfaced earlier this week which shows NRL personality Bryan Fletcher being stitched up.

The footage, which allegedly shows Fletcher (44) looking to purchase a small zip-lock bag of what seems like an illicit substance from an ‘Uber’ driver, has been shared widely on social media.

The retired second-rower has since told the media that he was ‘stitched up’ and that he never has and never will ‘get around the Persians’.

In response to Fletcher’s statement, police have launched a probe into the scumbag who tried to tarnish the footballer’s name.

Speaking to the media a short time ago in the Harbour Capital, A NSW Police spokesman has asked for the public’s help in identifying the dog in question.

“Who would do such a thing?” they asked reporters.

“The man was just trying to get a ride home and some punk tries to sell him a bag of crushed up meth, numbing agent and baby laxative for $300. What a low act! Even if he was up to no good, you don’t film a man when he’s breaking the law,”

“Even I know that. In saying that, we’re asking members of the public to come forward with any information they have regarding the identity of the dog.”

At the moment, police say no charges are likely to be laid, with Police saying they just want to ‘name and shame’ the offender.

“We feel that a trial by social media here is the best way to deal with this matter.”

ALP Gets A Bit Cocky After By-Elections And Announce Plans To Begin Executing Bank Executives

ALP Leader Bill Shorten recorded a resounding victory over Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull’s government, winning four of five Federal by-elections around the country, to return the seats that he had already won last election but actually lost because his own colleagues couldn’t remember where the fuck their parents were born.

Hundreds of thousands of Australians went to the polls to have their say in electorates across four states in ‘Super Saturday’ votes that had the potential to re-shape the Federal Parliament, but didn’t because everyone pretty much voted the same as they had last time.

Iit appears this lengthy media storm and subsequent return to the status quo has instilled a new wave of confidence in Shorten and the rest of the Labor Party, following a press conference he held immediately after the results came in.

Political analysts say it is nearly impossible to tell, at this stage, whether Shorten’s election promise to tie up high-ranking employees within the financial and banking sector, and shooting them in the brain, will prove worth it.

“Hmmm” said ABC Insider’s host, Barrie Cassidy.

“Threatening a purge on the banking execs might be bit far me thinks”

“You can’t just kill people in the street”

However, it seems there is no quelling the bold confidence of Shorten, who has said he’d even go as far as cutting heads off in public squares.

“The people want blood.” he said.

“And who am I to deny the most vocal minorities promises of potentially problematic knee-jerk solutions that result in people dying”

Social Media Post Funny Enough To Warrant Dropping A ‘B’ In Front Of The ‘ahaha’

A local tradesman has today given a humorous social media post a big old tick of approval.

Browsing through his phone on lunch, Curtis Shayler stumbled upon a hilarious photo of a DIY fail on Facebook.

So funny was the post, that it called for the dropping on a ‘b’ on the ‘ahaha’ comment that went along with the name of an untagged mate.

Previous research by the Royal University of Betoota has indicated that the use of the word ‘b’ in front of laughing comments is closely associated with only the funniest 10% of content on Facebook.

29-year old Shayler, a chippy by trade spoke to our reporters about just what sort of stuff deserves that ‘b’ at the front.

The Golf Course local estate explained that a photo of stuff like some weekend warriors butchering a project is something that warrants a good bahaha.

“Yeah, that or any good apprentice pranks. Like when they get em to try and roll start the concrete saw, or catch the sparks out the back of the grinder. That sort of stuff,” Shayler said.

“Also like, NRL gags, like Sharon Woods, Bulldogs being shit and ‘penalty broncos’ stuff.”

Tuesday’s announcement that Usain Bolt will be joining the A-League has been met with excitement from north of Sydney to south of Lake Macquarie – as the world’s fastest man confirms he has signed with the Central Coast Mariners.

Bolt had long expressed a desire to play professional football, but has not been able to make that dream come true, after trialling with German club Borussia Dortmund and Stromsgodset in Norway – but finding himself unable to secure a contract at either.

It appears Bolt has already spent time getting to know the unique people and culture of Central Coast New South Wales, after being spotted with his a new hotted up LowLux in the Kincumber Maccas car park, just 11 kilometres South-West of the region’s capital, Gosford.

The Central Coast-style Lowlux is believed to have been complimentary with his Central Coast Mariners contract, and comes with a UNIT flat brim as well as a year’s supply of Monster energy drinks.

Speaking to the Betoota Advocate today, Bolt says he has been enjoying snapping the Lowlux into third while coming down the the Pacific Motorway’s Gosford exit near Kariong.

“I also enjoy the Bliss n Eso CDs they left in the car, mon” he said.

“I have also developed an addiction to the pokies at the RSL near the club. People say I’m fitting in well”

However, despite the many perks and flexibility of his lucrative new five-figure A-league contract, Usain Bolt has reportedly been warned to not behave like a charismatic Jamaican man in front of female sports reporters, or risk having the Sydney Morning Herald publish lies about him.

“Don’t blush, mate” he says to Betoota Advocate’s Errol Parker, before cutting a few hoops in the car park and fanging it back into town for training.

Report: USB Actually Wasn’t The Wrong Way Around The First Time

TEXT:

A local USB thumb-drive has been accused of lying to it’s owner this afternoon, after being successfully inserted after three rotations.

The USB’s owner, Sally (22, marketing, West Betoota), says she isn’t even surprised anymore – and says she doubts that there has ever been anyone that has successfully inserted their thumb drive into their laptop the first time around – ever, in the history of the world.

USB (Universal Serial Bus), is an industry standard that establishes specifications for cables, connectors and protocols for connection, communication, and power supply between personal computers and their peripheral devices – and not necessarily the thumb-drives that most people would associate with the abbreviation.

However, in Australia, a country that not only disrespects but also fears technological innovation, the term is solely reserved for the only USB compatible devices that anyone owns – their data storage ‘sticks’.

“Oh for fucks sake” shrieks Sally, upon her third and succesful attempt.

“What a fucking joke”

“Why didn’t it just go in the first time”

Sally, however, is not alone.

A recent survey by the Department for IT and Communications has found that 97% percent of USB users admit to having never inserted their USB on the first go – with many stating it’s usually the third or fourth time that works a charm.

Tradie Praised For Posting Video That Isn’t About Cyclists And Parking Rangers Being Fuckwits

A diesel mechanic from Traralgon, 164km east of Melbourne, has been praised after gracing Facebook with a non-parking-ranger-related face-to-camer Facebook video.

The father-of-two, Jakson Elfrign published an emotional and heartfelt video on Facebook last week and has since gone viral

He implored men around the country to have more respect for women and for themselves, to stand up to other men who perpetuate Australia’s “shocking rape culture”.

However, most viewers say the most stunning thing about the video is the fact that Jackson didn’t call anyone a fuckwit – as is the case with most small-town tradie’s Facebook video uploads.

Usually aimed at parking rangers or cyclists, or even cops – video sermons have been on the race in regional Australian towns, ever since social media gave everyone the opportunity to not only have opinions, but also broadcast them.

Complete with his pearlescent tradie sunglasses and broad regional Victorian accent, Jakson has proven that some tradies are worked up about things that are a bit bigger than minor inconveniences in traffic.

Jakson’s video about how women need to be treated with respected has been shared more than 29,000 times by Friday. It has been viewed more than a million times as well.

Nation That Declared Itself FIFA Champion After 2 Wins Humbled By Speck Of Eastern Europe

TEXT:

A country of 53 million people that apparently invented football and hosts some of the most storied EPL clubs in the world has been knocked out of the FIFA world cup by a developing Eastern European country with a population the size of Brisbane.

The Republic Of Croatia, formerly known as the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, has knocked England out of the World Cup finals – after close to a month of English fans telling the planet that it’s coming home.

In what was thought to be a guaranteed world cup win, England have realised they might have jumped the gun a bit – after declaring themselves FIFA champions after beating Tunisia and Panama.

Last night’s match, however, didn’t fit the narrative. Because England lost, because Croatia appeared to be better than them.

In the second half of extra-time Croatian Mario Mandzukic kicked the winning goal after Kyle Walker failed to clear the ball. The Juventus forward dipped past John Stones, made a move on the loose ball, and sent her home.

“But… It… It was supposed to be coming home” said Dougald Patterly, a local Englishman with horrible teeth who was watching the match at the Lord Kidman Hotel in Betoota last night.

“But… But… We beat Tunisia!”

It is believed that the population of England will now redirect their energy towards the One Day International cricket matches that they’ve been winning, and leaving the EU because their country is better than the rest of Europe.

The 34-year-old father of six reckons that the people of Europe are currently being swamped by unwanted immigrants.

Despite never having travelled further abroad that Thailand, Keith is pretty across the economic and social ramifications that a relatively large number of refugees from Africa and the Middle East are having upon continental Europe, the British Isles and Scandinavia.

“Mate, it’s not good over there,” said the man who knows spends his days on the internet.

“There is plenty of stuff on the internet as well mate. They are being swamped over there. The people of Germany, Sweden, France, Italy and so on,” explained Davis.

“You heard about those sexual assault case in Germany? Probably not if you are just lapping up what the mainstream media is feeding you guys.”

He told our reporters that despite Australia being very geographically and socially different to the continent of Europe, if we as a country don’t act now, we could end up overrun by people who have had their countries torn apart by conflict.

“Yeah, look at the French, they are being invaded by Africans from countries they and the Belgians invaded, pillaged and abandoned in a postcolonial vacuum all those years ago,” Keith said.

“So we need to close our borders okay.”

Australian Journalism’s Next John Pilger Loses Her Spark After 180 Cheese Pull Articles

TEXT:

Britney Kovacs is often prone to asking herself existential questions.

Not in the wanky Nitschke or Kierkegaard sense, but in the ‘what the fuck am I doing with my life’ sense.

The question usually arises on Sunday mornings just before midday, or when she is caught up at some work drinks on a Thursday.

However, today she was left wondering why she even bothered with her career after editing a video of someone pulling apart a cheese based dish.

Working for a youth-oriented online newspaper within a large multinational media organisation in inner-Betoota’s trendy Roma Hills, young Kovacs spent the best part of her morning cutting and putting together footage of a cheesy baked good being pulled apart from 5 different angles.

The unidentifiable meal that had been cut open and had some other ingredients like bacon and pasta put inside it, is not exactly what Kovacs spent years of her life studying and interning for.

Growing up as a young person interested in journalism, with a mind full of silly ideas about covering important issues and events, Kovacs thought she might follow her dreams and aspire to be a Leigh Sales, or a Kate McClymont, or even a John Pilger.

However, now 2 years out of university, as a video editor and copywriter for the profit-driven masthead, poor Kovacs has finally realised that clicks might just be king.

While watching the video rack up the likes and comments, and preparing to write a commissioned article about the internet’s response to this video, Kovacs spoke to our reporters.

“That’s going to be our most successful post for the week on our socials. A video of someone pulling apart some fucking cheese. I’ve written 180 articles about cheese pulls” she said.

“Videos sent to us by restaurant chains, and paid for be restaurant chains”

“At least the dog video from last week was cute, and not some ad dressed up as content.”

“When I just sit here, at my open plan desk making shit like that, I wonder why the fuck I ever even bothered.”

“Did you hear those boys in Thailand got out safe? The editor said he might let me write about it once I’ve finished up the sponsored articles for BHP”

American Sports Fan Feels Compelled To Celebrate The Fourth Of July For Some Reason

TEXT:

Despite heavy frost being forecast for central parts of the Simpson Desert this evening, a French Quarter American sports fan is hosting a ‘Fourth Of July’ themed barbeque tonight in celebration of all things American.

Pushing on despite the cold, Ross Tuross explained to The Advocate that he planned tonight’s evening, to get all his mates over for a real ‘humdinger’ but most importantly, it provides another opportunity to watch some American sports in the company of other people.

“I usually have to watch them alone,” he said.

“But as I’m throwing a party tonight, on a muthafukking [sic] school night, everybody will be here eating hotdogs and cobb loaves and shit. It’ll be great. No football on until September, which is a source of sadness for me. But there’s Nationals v Red Sox tonight at 1am,”

“There’s no NBA on, either. Which sucks. Come to think of it, I don’t even know why I’m doing this. Maybe I could put a SuperBowl on or something? I’ll work something out.”

Ross conceded that he’s only hosting a July 4th Jamboree because he felt compelled to as he’s known as the American sports guy among his many friendship circles.

In fact, the 29-year-old left-armed Chinaman said he organised the whole thing on a sarcastic comment made by a mate of his a few weeks ago.

“I was talking about the NBA down the Dolphins Club last week and one of the boys said, ‘Oi Rosco, you fucking spoon, bet you’re hosting something next Wednesday for the Fourth, you bug fucking yankophile!’ and I basically had to commit to it there and then,”

“Now here we are.”

Report: Get Used To These Low Cost Social Events, Because Amy’s Saving For Europe

TEXT:

A recent report by a group of local girlfriends has found that one of their friend’s half-hearted plans to holiday overseas in the near future means that everyone now has to adhere to her budget.

The fact that Amy refuses to miss out of social outings has also had further complications to the predicament, as it now means everyone must return to the type of budgeting not seen since their first year out of school.

With a close friend’s birthday party coming up, Amy has now hijacked all preparations in an effort to not hae to spend more than $30 dollars over the weekend.

“Hey guys, lets just drink at home before going to the party” says the 24-year-old, after someone suggested getting a drink at a licensed venue.

Her suggestion, while offered as simply an option, is actually more of a demand. Because she can’t afford to waste money on pointless stuff like catching up in a place that is convenient for everyone else.

“Guys, I’ve gotta go to Europe in four months. I can’t be out spending money on three standard drinks and maybe a tray of dip”

At time of press, everyone agreed they would join her in drinking fruity lexia goon.

Dying Old Leftie Far Too Much Of An Intellectual To Be Remembered For Pedophilia

TEXT:

As he lay on his death bed in a monstrous Eastern Suburbs mansion, waves of admirers and family members paid their last visit to arguably one of Australia’s most courageous thought-makers of the last century, Bob Shenson.

A writer, an artist, a public servant. Shenson is responsible for some of the few relatively emotive speeches delivered by a member of the Labor Party in recent history. It’s because he had a magical way with words and was such God damn amazing mind.

In fact, so popular was this un-athletic bohemian social commentator, that even some the small L members of the Liberal Party list him as one of their favourite 20th century writers and artists.

While it is acknowledged that he may have been a horrible father at times, and a horrible husband most of the time, Shenson will be remembered for his contribution to the the Australian psyche. For the fodder he fed to the open minds of wealthy white people who were still a bit too conservative for Germaine Greer.

However, for Shenson, it wasn’t always writing residencies in Tuscany and dinners with Premiers and Prime Ministers. He also moved in dark circles.

Shenson used to put his keys in a few bowls and do unclassified narcotics with the bohemian Sydneysiders. He used to live on the fringes.

This appeared more obvious than ever when a spate of allegations from former child victims were directed towards the iconic leftie troubador, and inevitably not reported on by his friends and admirers who work at the ABC and Fairfax.

In fact, Shenson, and several of his similarly pedophilic mates were quite lucky to avoid being named in the final report from the almost five-year royal commission into child sexual abuse – which was officially handed to the Governor-General on the 18th of December last year – just before the allegations came to liht

The document is tens of thousands of pages long, and contains a total of 409 recommendations which aim to make institutions safer for children, but doesn’t really include tips on how to provide safety for the children of bourgeoise art groupies who are preyed upon by friends of their parents in their own homes.

The fifteen year process of organising the means for this report to exist seems to have effectively overlooked a rather prominent institution, the Sydney Eastern Suburbs Intelligentsia and their more iconic creative minds – more specifically, ALP speech writers, artists and the generically kooky beret-wearing Spectrum magazine regulars.

Unluckily for the victims, Shenson and his dead old comrades are far too well-liked by both the media and political elite to be remembered for the quite serious sex crimes they all perpetrated against children.

“I dunno If I believe it” says one elite Glebe-based atheist academic, Char Donèt (55).

“Bit unfair he can’t really defend himself. Who knows what the intentions are of the people saying these things are”

At time of his death, the only media personalities willing to address the accusations against Shenson were Murdoch columnists who took the allegations as an opportunity to say ‘the silence from the left is deafening’ when it comes to non-Cardinal Pell-related sex crimes.

Local Busker Stages Drive-By In Order To Boost Record Sales

TEXT:

The local music scene has been rocked by the news that busker Mitch Eastment (23) has staged his own drive-by shooting in order to promote his upcoming EP.

Considered a rising star in the busking scene, Eastment was reportedly found dead in his 1999 Hyundai Excel, although it was later revealed he had fallen asleep while listening to his own music, spilling a strawberry milk down his shirt as he did.

Dozens of fans showed their support with his Spotify plays going up by 9000%, earning him $1.26 in revenue before tax.

“It’s a good plan because I have so many enemies,” bragged the humble busker.

“Everyone I know is a suspect. I am in debt to all of them!”

Upon hearing the news of his alleged death, friends and family of Eastment forgave the troubled young man for his inappropriate behaviour and even gave his music a listen for once.

“It’s tragic,” stated close friend Laura Wall.

“I was definitely going to go to his next gig too. Probably.”

Even though he knows he can’t keep the act up forever, Eastment is confident that faking his violent death is the smartest career choice he has made so far.

“I’m not asking for much, just to move some records out of my parent’s garage. It’s not like I’m asking people to forgive me for the horrible things I’ve done… but let’s be honest they probably will now.”

Lygon Street Pretty Quiet

TEXT:

The epicentre of Italian-Australian culture on Australia’s Eastern Seaboard looks like a country town this World Cup, especially compared to 2006, when they were flipping cars and letting off flares.

Italy, as four-time world cup winners, did not record the results necessary during qualification to advance to the final field of 32. They scuffed their way to a second-place finish in their qualifying group, before getting knocked out by Sweden.

Our reporters have been able to identify a sharp increase in residents saying that the standard of soccer at the 2018 World Cup has been very low quality this time around, particularly in Italian-Australian hubs like Lygon Street (Melbourne), Norton Street (Sydney), Merthyr Road (Brisbane) and Sir Joh Boulevard (Betoota).

This comes days after a prominent Italian-Australian from West Betoota told our reporters that he hasn’t really been watching much of the soccer, because it’s been really shit.

Local boutique stone and tile retailer, Marco Bianchi (32) says it’s pretty weird that so many shit teams got in, and the bits and pieces he has seen on TV has been extremely underwhelming.

“Yeah, not that into it this year hey” says Marco.

“Socceroos lost to France. That was to be expected, but even that was a shit match”

“Like, most of the teams in it are shit this year. Belgium is probably gonna win the whole thing, and that’s just sad”

Like many Italian-Australians, Marco is actually quite interested in soccer all-year-round, and not just during the World Cup. And like many Italian-Australians he is secretly heartbroken that a soccer illiterate nation like Australia could garner a spot over his family’s home country.

“Women Need To Be More Careful” Says Man Who Passed Out In Pub Car Park On Friday Night

TEXT:

Local man Gordon Leonard (25) says male on female violence can be easily avoidable if our nation’s women take care of themselves and don’t end up in situations where they might be vulnerable.

The South Betoota-based Joe Rogan-enthusiast says he shares the same concerns as everyone when it comes to the rates of assault, harassment and murder of women in Australia.

“It’s not rocket science. If it’s dark, take a cab” he says.

“If the bloke in the lift looks like a creep, take the stairs alone”

In the days since a tragic incident in Melbourne sparked a national debate over the safety of women in our country, Gordon says that the statistics he’s been reading are alarming.

“I hope my sisters are smart enough to avoid going anywhere near caucasian middle-class men between the ages of 18-60 after 6pm”

Gordon’s comments come after Victorian Police urged women to stay alert while walking alone at night in a series of official statements throughout week.

“…just make sure you have situational awareness, that you’re aware of your surroundings,” said Local Superintendent David Clayton.

“If you’ve got a mobile phone carry it and if you’ve got any concerns, call police,” he said.

Without really giving the issue much thought, local man Gordon is siding with nation’s law enforcement authorities, by indirectly suggesting it is the the responsibility of women to not get assaulted by men in day-to-day life.

“I just think women can do a bit more to avoid danger” says the man who passed out halfway through a medium meatlovers pizza in the back car park behind his local pub after watching the Rooster V Panthers over the weekend with some mates.

“Women need to be more careful” he says, oblivious to the fact that a taxi nearly ran over him at 10pm on Friday night, before some local street kids went through his wallet.

“It’s common sense”

Ingham’s Truckie Ponders 3rd Zinger Of The Week

TEXT:

Ingham’s truck driver Martin Gribble (43) is reportedly internally conflicted this morning as he casually contemplates his third Zinger of the week for lunch today.

Having landed his job as an Ingham’s truck driver three years ago, Gribble has since lived out his childhood dream of visiting KFC daily for work, delivering fresh chook that has yet to make him not salivate, even in its uncooked state.

“Whoever said don’t get high on your own supply has never visited 50 KFCs a week.”

At approximately 11:10 am, Gribble was finishing up a delivery at KFC Ermington when he first floated the idea of smashing a fresh Zinger for today’s lunch, but became indecisive when he realised it would be his third this week.

“Well you see on Monday it was a treat because it was my brother’s birthday. Wednesday I got one because I was planning on the gym that evening. I shouldn’t have one today… mind you it is Friday though, and I am going to be dropping the chicken off fresh. Would almost be silly not to” he said.

Realising he was just going to scoff a servo pie that had probably been sitting there since he last pulled in, Gribble elected to indulge his triple Zinger work week, with the personal compromise that he orders it with coleslaw instead of chips.

“I’ll get a water instead of cola so I’m still being healthy,” he laughed.

Gribble remained tight lipped about the chances of dabbling in a fourth Zinger.

“The Zinger Quaddie hasn’t been done before but the day is still young.”

Neighbour’s Drop Saw Harmonises Beautifully With Local Kookaburra An Hour Before Alarm Clock

TEXT:

The trials and tribulations of living in a leafy suburban Queensland enclave were felt by all on Daroo Crescent in Betoota Grove this morning.

Local tradesman, Leo, has had waited until 6:00 am on the dot to fire up his beloved drop saw – as his non-council approved renovations continue to edge further out the backyard.

While Leo’s neighbours try their best to drift in and out of sleep between each incision, a local kookaburra has also decided to join in on the action.

As a species of the laughing kookaburra, the local bird is triggered by the noisy drop saw, which in turn spurs several other kookaburras who can be heard distantly throughout the neighbourhood.

The name laughing kookaburra refers to the bird’s “laugh”, which it uses to establish territory among family groups.

It can be heard at any time of day, but most frequently at dawn and dusk, and harmonises beautifully between the reee-reee sounds of a 22-year-old carpenter’s drop saw.

What starts with a low, hiccuping chuckle eventually fills the street with ringing laughter.

While hearing kookaburras in full voice is believed to be one of the more extraordinary experiences of the Australian bush, the kookaburra’s laughter harmonising with mounted power tools an hour before the morning alarm clock is also of note.

“Wait, So This Is Already Paid For?” Asks Dad Still Struggling With The Concept Of Uber

TEXT:

Even though this his third or fourth time catching an Uber, a local dad still appears to be battling with how his adult children are paying for these things.

“Wait, so is this one of those ones that’s already paid for?” asks 63-year-old Lionel Buckley.

While it’s been explained to him several times before, it seems the semi-retired kitchen appliances retailer is still not confident in his understanding of the 6-year-old transport app.

The fusion of the internet, private car owners, iPhones and debit card details are a bit much, but still he thinks it might be worth asking the driver – as he and his son make their way home from a local footy match.

Once again, the explanation doesn’t seem to be thorough enough. As the car reaches it’s destination out front of his house, Lionel reaches for his wallet.

“Hold up dad, this is all sorted” says his son, Damien.

Despite having his own son somewhat involved in the shareable economy, Lionel still somehow thinks this car arrived because someone made a phone call, and that paying this bloke in cash is still an option.

“Wait, so you paid already?” he asks again.

“Where’s the metre? Make sure you’re not getting ripped off”

“This Ice Thing Is Actually Pretty Bad Hey” Says Shorten During Rare Trip Outside Melbourne

TEXT:

During a rare trip to the bush, Bill Shorten has finally realised all those audience members who ask questions about societal disintegration on Q&A actually aren’t being that dramatic.

While visiting a one-horse brothel town somewhere in regional South Australia, the leader of the opposition was visibly startled by the obvious meth-related decay of a community that supposedly votes for him.

“Holy shit” he said.

“Did you just see those blokes going at out front of the TAB?”

“That’s gotta be more than the grog hey”

According to the 2016 National Drug Strategy Household Survey, over 6.3% of Australians over the age of 14 had ever used methamphetamine and 1.4%  reported recent use. These rates remain considerably higher than those reported in 2011.

Data from a number of sources indicate rates of methamphetamine use are higher among rural and remote areas of Australia compared to regional areas and major cities. This is also supported by recent data from the 2018 report of the National Wastewater Drug Monitoring Program which found that average consumption of methamphetamine in regional areas exceeded consumption in capital cities – where the usage is felt by all those in the community due to population size.

Shorten, after asking his advisors if meth was the same as pingers, was quick to show feelings that resembled legitimate concern, and vowed to mention it in a party meeting after the election.

“This is actually pretty bad out here” he said to a staffer.

“Remind me to think about this again after Barnaby’s tell-all on Sunday night”

Boring Town Makes Up A Rumour About A Panther

TEXT:

After over 12 months of research, a study by the Black Panther Sightings Organisation (BPSO) has confirmed that there must be a large number of big cats residing in Australia.

The report found that over 16 separate towns and localities genuinely claim to have a panther lurking in their shire, leaving the researchers to estimate that there must be nearly 20 big cats stalking the countryside.

With each report somehow relating to a wild yarn about a big cat escaping from the traveling circus.

The towns of Lancefield and Bealiba in Victoria, Toodyay in WA, and Cessnock, Illawarra and Walcha in NSW were just some of the areas that claim to have a Lithgow Panther prowling through their backyards.

While the existence of the famous Lithgow/Blue Mountains/ Dapto Panther was confirmed a long time ago, the other towns are still fighting to have their own panthers recognised.

Lead researcher Kayle Bradshaw told the Advocate that there is strong reason to believe that there could be even more towns claiming to have a panther of their own.

“We didn’t manage to get up to places like Nimbin and Gympie, but have heard some residents up their have compelling panther sighting evidence,” Bradshaw said.

Andy Raymond from Cessnock told our reporters that he can’t believe he is still fighting for recognition.

“What does this fucking study even mean huh? That we claim to have a panther? We have a fucking panther. I’ve seen it with my own eyes. I’m sick of trying to convince people,” he said.

“Look at these photos, if you don’t take these as proof then there is no point us talking anymore,” he said while pulling out his 2011 Huawei T Mobile Prism and showing our reporters grainy photos of something that looked like a big dog in amongst some long grass.

Our reporters told Raymond they better leave.

Personal Trainer Treats Self To Unpoached Chicken

TEXT:

Personal trainer Michelle Langley (24) has done the unthinkable and treated herself to some unpoached chicken for the first time since she began her strict meal plan three years ago.

It was a cheat meal she had been planning on rewarding herself with for weeks.

Upon finishing the 156-week ‘Kick-a-Chick’ meal and exercise plan, Langley immediately headed to KFC where she reportedly splurged and hedonistically ordered a Zinger box and a side of Original Recipe chicken.

“I’ve bloody earnt this, that meal plan was even harder than my TAFE course,” she said to our reporters.

Having lived off high protein, low taste meals such as poached chicken, steamed vegetables and the unidentified contents of a dish called a “Buddha bowl,” Langley is relieved to finally eat something that has some flavour and feels content with a bottle of Pepsi Max and a few pirated episodes of Survivor.

Whilst she ploughed through the meal with the speed and satisfaction of a piss-wrecked fourth-grade footy player, Langley battled back inner thought pangs by consoling herself with the fact that she was eating fresh Aussie chicken.

“Fuck knows where those Buddha Bowls are made anyway.” she thought to herself.

“And you’ve gotta treat yourself you know. I’ve just spent effectively 10% of my life eating cardboard, so something with a bit of flavour was well and truly needed.”

Langley explained that while she was looking forward to her unpoached chicken, she was not expecting to react to the flavour with a rapid series of overwhelming tears of joy and one period where she blacked out and woke up speaking in tongues with a chicken drumstick hanging out of her mouth.

After eating the Zinger Box, Langley reportedly lay on her bed drafting up a ‘cheeky’ yet ‘honest’ cheat day post about a meal many people eat regularly, to share with her followers.

Smoker Validates Disgusting Habit By Providing Bottle Opener For Everyone

A local piece of shit who loves polluting the atmosphere with the wafting smell of his own lack of self respect, has today made up for his personal shortfalls by providing a lighter to open the beers with.

Pete Wheelwright (26) has been suck back the lung busters for years now, and as his mates gradually quit, he’s one of the last remaining nicotine-dependant degenerates in his social circle.

While some of his more precious mates are annoyed by his addiction, due to all the time they have to spend in designated only smoking areas (DOSA) – they are forgetting that it always comes in handy whenever they get drunk enough to decide they want a late night durry, or whenever they accidentally buy pop tops without having an opener.

“Oi chuck us your lighter” Greg demands of Pete.

“These actually aren’t screw tops after all”

“I thought they were but they aren’t. Do you have a lighter one you”

As the night progresses and Pete’s lighter keeps going missing every time he wants to have a darb, he streamlines the process by offering to open everyones bottles for them. Like a fucking bartender.

At time of press, Pete was concerned that the budget, non-bic lighter he was using may explode in his hands soon.

Inner-Brisbane 4WD Owner Finally Takes The Beast Off-Road In Reckless Curb Park

Ascot-based real estate tycoon, Darren Fanning (35) has today ‘broken in’ his brand spankin’ Prado, after pulling the arse out and parking with two wheels on the nature strip outside his family home.

Only months after picking up ‘the beast’ at Moorooka’s magic mile, Darren is still yet to squeeze in a trip to Fraser Island with his other concrete cowboy mates, who also own beasts.

Even with Darren’s lack of modifications and sand-driving, it doesn’t stop him from taking a few liberties in the city… The type of things that only 4WD nuts like him known about.

“This thing has barely been parked on bitumen” he chuckles to himself.

“Gotta be careful I don’t get booked by the rangers”

“Let’s just say, when we got a bit of stormwater flooding down near the footy oval the other night, I wasn’t one of those sissies skirting around the lollipop lady and looking for an alternative route.”

“[laughter] Just went straight through. You should have seen the faces on all the yuppies at school pick up”

However, unlike most inner-Brisbane 4WD owners, Darren has actually managed to take the car further west than the light industrial car dealership suburb that he picked it up from.

“Yeah, just took her out west on the weekend. Wanted to go off-road but our friends in Dalby are cotton farmers so it was pretty much all sealed roads”

“Taking her out to Gatton this weekend to pick up some antique homeware for the missus. Should be able to get a bit of off-roading in”

Catlike Abilities Wasted On Cats

TEXT:

According to its owners and other acquaintances, a local cat has spent most of it’s spoilt life on its arse, and not doing any of the cool shit humans would do if they were cats.

3-year-old Fluffy has not once climbed to the top of a tree in the botanical gardens and very rarely struts along the top of the picket fences that surround her owner’s house.

In fact, as far as anyone knows, it hasn’t even caught a mouse or jumped onto the roof.

It’s owners don’t even know if, given the circumstance, it would be able to land on it’s feet from a height – as it has not yet been able to display any form of cat righting reflexes.

The cat righting reflex is a cat’s innate ability to orient itself as it falls in order to land on its feet. Cats are able to do this because they have an unusually flexible backbone and no functional clavicle. The righting reflex begins to appear at 3–4 weeks of age, and is perfected at 6–7 weeks – however, no one knows if Fluffy has ever had to utilise these naturally-gifted catlike abilities.

“She barely goes outside, and when he does it’s just so she can fuck up the garden” says owner, Sarah.

“She probably doesn’t even know how to eat things that aren’t mushed down with a fork”

Amazon Working To Stop Alexa From Giggling While Reading Your Search History

TEXT:

The world’s largest retailer and biggest reason your bank keeps calling you to double-check if your card was stolen or not, Amazon, has today announced a new internal investigation into several reports that Alexa, their SmartHome platform, has been randomly and consistently bursting into laughter while reading your Internet search history.

In a press conference delivered via precision drone strike, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos vowed that his company would get to the bottom of why Alexa was being such a judgy bitch and mocking you for your search history unprompted, and pledged that whatever the reason may be, his company would fix it in 4-6 business days.

“Some of the reports that we have heard from households around the world have been very concerning”, said Bezos in the 4 minute clip that requires an Amazon Video account to view. “And I promise, on my word as the current richest man in the world, that I will get to the bottom of why Alexa is randomly doing this, and put an end to it, hopefully without using too much of my money which, if you may recall, I have a lot of”.

“The Alexa experience has always fundamentally been about allowing us to listen in on your private, most intimate conversations so that we can tell advertisers everything about you and make heaps of money while you start seeing more toaster oven ads. The fact that Alexa is randomly bursting into laughter while reading your search history is completely against the company’s policy and moral code – any time spent laughing is less time spent listening secretly”.

“Amazon has also always fundamentally been a company of inclusion, and diversity. Frankly, we don’t care what kind of porn you’re into, as long as you buy the paraphernalia from our brand new Adult Toys department”

The statement comes after several reports surfaced last month claiming that Alexa units around the world would randomly start accessing users’ search histories, start laughing, and say automated phrases such as “seriously, THAT’S what you’re into. Does your wife know?”

One prominent privacy group, Pornoholics Anonymous, have said that while they appreciate Amazon’s new efforts, they’ll believe the results when they see them.

“Everyone is entitled to their privacy and security”, said Mike Dragon, the pseudonym used by Barry Mills when anonymously talking to the Advocate about the issue. “I mean, selling our private and personal data to billion-dollar ad agencies is one thing. But laughing? That’s a step too far”.

Senator Di Natale Getting Everything Ready For 20th Of April

Leader of The Greens Richard Di Natale did not appear his confident, charming self as he spoke to reporters today, appearing to fidget and twiddle his thumbs.

“I’ve just been trying to make sure we can clear our schedule in a couple days. I’ve been making sure there’s nothing I need to tend to in the senate”

“Think I accidentally voted in favour of whaling but whatever.”

Last year Di Natale said he was determined to get out of parliament to celebrate ‘Green Christmas’ – which takes place on the 20th of April, a date referencing the number 420, which Di Natale describes as ‘a very powerful number in Cannabis culture.’

“Last year I treated myself to some cheeky Doritos.”

With parliament concluding at 4:15 pm, Di Natale and his party members rushed out of parliament, knocking the Honourable Bob Katter III to the ground as they went though, sprinting to meet in the carpark of the Canberra Times before moving to an undisclosed location.

“It’s an important day for those in need of medicinal cannabis and those of us who want to take the edge off and chill with a bit of UB40.” he said.

As the night digressed, Di Natale did not appear the stressed-out version of his former self and had full confidence in his parties revolutionary new plan.

This year the night coincides with The Greens’ new policicies that would make access to medicinal cannabis easier for those in need of relief from chronic pain or a reason to enjoy memes about children’s cartoons.

“You see it’s a plan for medicinal cannabis and I’ll be putting it forward on 4/20 day. We are doing that intentionally actually. Pass me the guitar man, you’re doing it all wrong, we’re off the record now aren’t we? What’s your name again? I like you, do you ever come to Melbourne?”

New Nationals MP ‘Mrs Joycefire’ Impresses Colleagues At Party Conference

TEXT:

As The Nationals party begins to feel some sense of normality again, their party summit in Gundagai (aka Rock the Riverina) has been shaken by the arrival of boisterous new MP known only as Mrs Joycefire.

During George Christensen’s Warren Truss impersonation, Mrs Joycefire stormed the stage, snatching the microphone, before proceeding to roast Christensen.

It is believed most of the jokes were centred around the incel MPs weight, stating the only woman waiting for him at home is Mrs Mac.

The alleged insults were reportedly met with raucous laughter and applause before Mrs Joycefire took aim at the entire branch of the WA Nationals, stating they had as much power as “a group of soft-handed, half-baked Lismore Greens.”

Following the roast Mrs Joycefire proceeded to lead the party in a 12-minute-long extended version of The Nutbush

Unconfirmed reports state Mrs Joycefire later quipped the dance was the most exercise Christensen would get this year.

Nationals party leader Michael McCormack says this year’s summit was the best of his career, stating that Mrs Joycefire was certainly the bell of the ball.

“I haven’t enjoyed myself this since I was downing West Coast Coolers as an 18-year-old with Mark Vaile in a Cootamundra woolshed. Fark, Joycefire is a real card, I wonder if there’s a seat for her on the front bench?”

“Or on my lap!”

Unemployed Mate Can’t Believe You Aren’t Keen To Back Up Tonight

TEXT:

A recently-but-not-so-recently unemployed man is making drastic moves to avoid watching Ellen on television today, and instead, he is stretching out phone calls with his mates working 9-5.

While his mates act polite and try their best to not be distracted by their jobs, Jim Peterson (28) wants to know what else happened after he left on Saturday night.

“Was it good? haha” asks Jim.

His most recent target, Ollie, responds truthfully.

“Mate there was only two of us left, me and my housemate. I think we just had another beer and went to bed”

Jim says he wishes he could have stayed longer but he had to do some family shit the next morning, but what else is going on?

As Ollie’s boss notices that there are not enough fake smiles on his face to warrant a work call, he slowly begins levitating towards his desk.

“Aahh Jimbo I think I’ve gotta go mate” says Ollie.

Jim feels like he’s being brushed for no good reason and can’t seem to understand why a 35-minute phone call in the middle of the workday isn’t appropriate.

“Nah wait up a second. Where was I? Oh yeah, what do you think about that girl that we were talking to at the footy like two weeks ago with the short hair that was there with Jenna?” he says.

“Mate I’ve gotta go”  Ollie responds.

“Righto. Give me a call back when you are free” says a defeated Jim.

“Actually, you keen to get back on it tonight?”

Ollie says no I’ve got a bit on.

Jim can’t believe it, like it won’t be that big, but whatever.

At time of press, Jim was dominating his group chat with low quality memes, only to be met with the occasional haha.

David Warner Issues Heartfelt Apology For Betraying ‘The Spirit of LG OLED Televisions’

TEXT:

Former Australian Vice-Captain and current holder of the ‘Trevor Chappell Award For Most Disappointing Australian’, David Warner, has issued a heartfelt apology to fans across the world after his actions betrayed the very spirit of LG TVs he once held so dear.

Warner, who was today banned from cricket for 12 months for his role in the ball-tampering scandal currently engulfing the team, says that his actions do not reflect the values and ideals he was taught by the LG marketing department, after he became an official spokesperson for the company in 2016.

“I sit here today a man deeply ashamed to have let down the entire LG family”, said a teary-eyed Warner, in a press conference held from the comfort of the black couch at his beach house.

“I’m generally away for the winter, so I have the summer to hang out watching cardoons with the kids. Unfortunately, I made a terrible error this summer and foolishly decided to spend it cheating with Steve and Cameron”.

“I have not only let my kids and the cardoons down – I’ve let the down all of the TVs made by LG, which as we all know have fantastic quality and a very sharp image”.

“My heart feels as black as the blacks in the OLED TVs, and it’s really showing and distinguishing all of my true colours I’ve shown the entire nation with my actions”.

“LG TVs are one of the most important symbols of a sporting nation like ours, and doing what I did has brought shame to a true icon of Australian Cricket”

“The cruel irony of this whole sorry situation is that one of my things I usually look forward to is sitting on my couch watching my LG OLED TV. I obviously can’t do that any more, because I’ve betrayed the spirit of what makes LG OLED TVs the worlds second largest South Korean-based TV company”

“I sincerely hope that the LG family finds it in their hearts to forgive me, and to send me the 2018 model of the 55inch 4k LG OLED TV, which I hear is excellent for watching close-up replays of clumsy attempts to hide evidence”

While Warner’s message has resonated with his tens of remaining fans, LG themselves appear to be unmoved, issuing a response mere hours after Warner’s press conference.

“Unfortunately, in such circumstances, LG has no choice but to part ways with Mr. Warner. LG has always been a company which has been strict in its ‘no ball tampering’ policy”.

“Mr. Warner, in his role in this incident, showed a clear lack of clarity in his thinking. Unlike the clarity of our brand new 2018 55inch 4k OLED TV, which is great”

Despite this, Warner remains convinced that he can eventually return to LG’s good graces, and in the meantime, will return to more grassroots TV companies in order to reconnect with his love of the OLED.

“Does anyone know if 3M make TVs?”

A local moron has today had toss up whether the scantily clad smoke-show that has just slid into his friend requests, with no pre-existing contact or mutual friends, is real or not.

“The last bot I accepted a friend request from actually had mutual friends, but they were all my battler single mates as well”

“The fact that she only has like 62 friends from the Gulf States makes me think she might be real”

Ethnic Dad Reaches 110 Decibels During Surprise 10pm Phone Call From An Old Overseas Mate

TEXT:

The other four members of the flinders family have today had to pause their Shrek 3 viewing as the patriarch received a phone call from an old mate he grew up with, who is currently on a cruise.

This interruption is doubly bad for the flinders family, not only has it prevented the viewing of Mike Myers greatest movie, but the perceived distance between John and his his abroad has meant that John is now yelling into the phone – making the living room uninhabitable for the duration of the call. 

“YEAH BILLY, GOOD MATE, GOOD. HOW ARE YOU? HOW ARE YOU GOING OVER THERE?” Enquired John, unaware that he is now speaking at above 100 decibels.

According to the other members of the Flinders family, the reason John yells into the phone is because the person on the other end is so far away.

“You should hear him on his mobile, he speaks bloody loud enough for the neighbours to hear” complains Joanne, John’s wife and mother of his children.

Betoota local police are all too familiar with ‘decibel dads’ as they’ve coined them, due to a surprising misunderstanding.

“A lot of domestic call outs are in fact just concerned neighbours reporting raised voices. But when we get there, we find Dads, like John, just having a yarn on the phone”

“It’s causing us a bit of trouble, we are in fear of developing a ‘boy who cried wolf’ scenario.”

Without a steadfast solution in the pipeline, we expect families across Australia to again brace themselves for another barrage of dad’s ear-drum-bursting evening phone calls as their mates takes off up North for the Winter months.

Jenna Hoping Mark Doesn’t Tell Anyone That She Told Ally That Bella Hooked Up With Tim

TEXT:

Jenna Betts (27) says she doesn’t really like partaking in gossip, but sometimes it’s for the greater good.

And, for the record, it’s not technically gossiping if you are simply informing a close friend of something that is being kept from her. Like, she’d want someone to do the same for her.

That’s why she informed Ally that her ex-boyfriend of a couple years ago had hooked up with their other, tier-3 peripheral friend Bella, while Ally was in Europe last year.

“I mean, I obviously knew about it for ages. But I wasn’t going to say anything until I really needed to” says Jenna.

And after a minor tiff with Bella last week, it became clear that it was time to tell Ally, because Bella can’t expect to be able to treat people like this.

The last 72 hours has seen their social circle swept up in a frenzy of phone calls, tears and severed friendships

Who knew? Jenna knew, but who else knew, and how many of these fake friends have kept it from Ally.

However, as the drama unfolds, the question on the rest of everyone’s mind is who told?

This is where Jenna is a sitting duck. The fact that she was the one that spilled the beans brings into question a possible ulterior motive – and it’s not about being a good friend to Ally, it’s about her own issue with Bella.

“I’ve told Ally not to tell anyone I told her” says Jenna.

“The only people that know that it was is Ally”

“And my boyfriend, who has been looped into every single conversation”

“And Mark Zuckerberg, who reads every single piece of information that every single person in the world shares via his social media tools including Facebook Messenger”

“I suppose that’s a worry”

Jenna’s concern come after the magnitude of Facebook’s surveillance scheme revealed by the Cambridge Analytica story has led to public outcry and sent shockwaves through the political systems in the US and UK.

“I’m just worried what Mark might want to use that information for” says Jenna.

“I hope he doesn’t tell anyone that it was me that told Ally”

INXS Best Enjoyed At Full Volume In Greek Hunk’s Marrickville Mercedes, Says The Chicks

TEXT:

A recent report by the nation’s chicks has found that the music made by 1990s Australian rock band INXS sounds way better when blaring from inside a Winfield-scented Valiant, owned by a bad boy from down the road.

Dubbed ‘The Marrickville Mercedes’ – the Chrysler Valiant has for several decades been a popular vehicle for young bucks in light industrial suburbs.

While many argue that both this type of car and brand of Australian rock may have dated, it still works for with the remaining generation X bachelors, who blame both for the fact that they haven’t settled down.

However, as was the case out the front of many bottle shops across the country in the 80s and 90s, any disrespect shown towards this particular make of car, or the chicks inside it – can usually result in a punch in the head. Meaning Australian men are not as hot for this type of set up as their female counterparts.

The groundbreaking findings show that while Hutcho still gets a run on triple M, and still hits the spot, the music definitely sounds better when you’ve snuck out to go for a few hot laps with a handsome Greek neighbour that your parents don’t like.

“It just sounds better” said a nostalgic 40-something survey respondent named Ally Brandy.

“It reminds me of my first boyfriend Theo, before he went to jail for drag-racing”

Mum Fucked Up And Bought Diet Cordial Again

TEXT:

A giant ice cold glass of obscure tasting orange fruit crush has confirmed that mum has accidentally thrown the 90% less sugar version of the family’s favourite cordial in the shopping trolley again.

What is yet another slip up in a Sunday grocery run is now something that everyone is going to have to cop on the chin until this particular bottle has been finished.

“Mum. This stuff isn’t nearly as good as the normal cordial” says the oldest daughter and most whinge-prone, Sal.

Mum, who seems to think like this is a perfectly forgivable mistake and actually not really that big of an issue at all, doesn’t give much in response.

“Did I? [haha]” she says.

“Whoops. Oh well. Probably better for your teeth”

This sense of rage felt by the entire family, who aren’t allowed soft drink and very rarely are exposed to any form of indulgent sweetness, is lost on mum – who doesn’t really drink cordial.

Her second oldest, Kylie, who just spent 10 minutes making a tumbler sized glass full of ice cubes, isn’t going to let it slip.

“Mum this is like the time you bought the cheapo coco pops. You’ve gotta look on the packaging. This stuff tastes like tinny water”

Mum, now irritating that this conversation has lasted this long, threatens to pour the whole thing down the sink and stop purchasing any cordial effective immediately.

“Oh you don’t like? Fine. Here give it to me”

Her threats are met with a half-hearted protest, as her kids accept that mixing the diet cordial with soda water is kind of like fanta.

Cellmate In Prison Movie Luckily Just A Kind-Hearted, Well-Connected, Mentor Figure

TEXT:

A wrongly incarcerated lead character in a prison movie has been relieved to find out that, out of all the psychopaths in the high-security prison, he has been allocated to a cell with a gentle old guy who is willing to protect and mentor him for no reason.

Like many prison movies, the character is now lucky enough to have an instant support network that will enable him to both rise through the ranks of the criminal hierarchy, while also providing him with resources to help put forward an appeal against the unfounded charges that landed him in this scenario to begin with.

As it appears that a poorly explained gang-affiliated antagonist has already taking a disliking to the lead character, this immediate friendship could not have come soon enough.

Prison is a place in which people are physically confined and, usually, deprived of a range of personal freedoms as a result of criminal charges. This film genre, as a category focuses on characters whose narrative elements primarily are constructed from inside the walls of a prison.

In this particular film, the lead character now has access to a mobile phone, as well as protection against other prisoners – unfortunately, it appears he may have to get his hands slightly dirty and engage in further criminal activities such as smuggling drugs and fighting people.

“Don’t be like me” says the grandfatherly mentor figure, alluding to the fact that he may deserve to be in prison, despite being a nice guy.

“You don’t belong in here”

Wake Attendees Comforted By Arrival Of Spring Rolls

TEXT:

Proving once and for all that every cloud has a silver lining, those mourning the untimely death of local second grade coach, Reginald “Reggie” Delaney, have been somewhat comforted by their loss with the inclusion of spring rolls at his wake.

Helping himself to a plate of about 30 spring rolls, Delaney’s second-rower, James Teaupa, stated he will miss his elderly mentor forever, but that these spring rolls are really doing the trick right now.

“It’s what he would have wanted bro. If he’d of known Jenny Olsen was going to show up and that there was going to be free pour sweet chilli sauce, he’d of said ‘kill me now.’”

Teaupa is just one amongst the bereaved in attendance which includes Delaney’s kids, brothers, wife, side-piece and footy team who all describe themselves as being deeply upset but feeling slightly better now that they’ve realised there are beef, chicken and veg spring rolls on offer.

“It’s so him. All these spring rolls almost make the fact he left our club in financial ruin”

“If his kids had thought about the possibility of spring rolls earlier, I’m sure they wouldn’t have waited so long to switch his life support off.”

Mrs Delaney was unable to make a statement due to being overcome with grief and having a mouth full of dim sim.

No stranger to a footy players funeral, the catering team prepared for the event with an alleged three trollies full of frozen food, including pastizzis, party pies, sausage rolls, mixed entrees and an unconfirmed three litres of tomato sauce.

“Spring rolls just make everything better. That and the black armbands we’re going to be wearing Sunday.”

FIFO Worker Out Blowing Entire Hour’s Pay Up His Nose, According To Snapchat

TEXT:

If Rodney Smith was a professional footballer or aspiring reality television star, he would be in a fair bit of trouble today.

The 30 something Fly In, Fly Out (FIFO) machinery driver at the Moranbah Coal Mine, (just inland from the city of Mackay) has put his disposable income on full display by beaming himself out to the world racking up a whole bag of his hourly pay

Smith works long days out at the open cut mine, and when he gets some time off, he likes to give it a bit of a nudge.

His expensive taste for bottled Jim Beam and Cola and the CNS stimulant, cocaine, is justified by the fact that he earns an hourly rate equivalent to that of a surgeon or partner at a law firm.

Living the life of a FIFO worker you may not begrudge his said vices, however, the fact that he always seems to record and broadcast his hobbies via social media may be a touch questionable.  

Smith is a real sucker for documenting his nights on social media, namely Snapchat, (an online platform that allows you to send short videos and pictures to friends), particular the parts where he sniffs his way through a few days work for most of his non-FIFO friends.

Smith’s most recent upload featured him snorting ‘white powder’ in a dimly lit room with a couple of other males to the soundtrack of him ‘Wooing’ and some 90’s American Hip Hop.

“Wooooooo. Hahahahaha,” he is heard saying during the video.

International Women’s Day: Local MRA Psyches Himself Up For Big Day On The Internet

TEXT:

As the United Nations take the day to acknowledge the annual March 8th commemoration that International Women’s Day, one local men’s rights activist named Darren says he has chosen to boycott the date out in protest of the growing inequality faced by middle class Australian men.

“Yeah. Get back to me when there’s a Single Dad’s Day, or at least a Men’s Day” says the 36-year-old stay-at-home data entry professional.

While looking at himself in the mirror, Eminem playing softly in the background, Darren says today is his Superbowl.

“Clementine won’t know what hit her” he says in an embarrassingly serious tone.

“No more Mister Nice Guy”

The theme for International Women’s Day 2018 is “Leave no woman behind”, examining the vital role that women play in humanitarian and disaster planning and response. Each of our events will explore the impacts disasters have on women and girls, and highlight the important roles that women play in risk reduction, rebuilding, rehabilitation and peace processes.

However, according to Darren, this kind of emphasis on empowering women is really only doing one thing: Creating a system that favours women in the regional Queensland family courts and creates arguments that don’t align with his denial of the gender wage gap.

Despite not having kids or ever having had a long-term partner, Darren says he has in fact taken the red pill – and has gone so far down the rabbit hole that it’s almost like he knows exactly what it’s like to go through a complex custody battle.

“Feminism is cancer” says the World Of Warcraft enthusiast.

“It’s creating a divide in society and tearing families a part. Even my stupid mum knows that”

New Baby Boomer-Themed GPS Tells Users How This All Used To Be Bush

TEXT:

The Global Positioning System (GPS) game has received a shake-up this week, with the arrival of the new Baby Boomer themed voice navigator.

Pundits, however, are at odds as to whether the new Baby Boomer (BB) system will help or hinder motorists.

The new program utilises the core data from Google Maps, but has an added feature which includes sometimes confusing directions and whinging commentary about how different the landscape was in the 80’s.

“Essentially, it’s just your old man or mother, narrating the journey, with all that stuff about how much quicker everything is with the new roads and bypasses and so on,” said local tech guru and owner of Ted’s Tech in the French Quarter, Ted Hamley.

“I’m not sure if it’s going to help people or piss them off,” he said.

Hamley said he has been using the GPS for the last couple of weeks and has started to notice a more nuanced and subtle undertone to the commentary.

“I have been picking up little things like whining about how much easier it was for me to buy my car than it was for the narrator to buy their car, and how much easier my life is compared to how theirs was at my age.”

CEO of the new boomer-themed software company, Bill Forrest explained to us that the subtle self-righteous undertone was all part of the charm.

“We have designed it so it’s exactly like your father or mother are sitting right there with you, asking probing questions, giving last-minute directional instructions and telling you how easy you have got it.”

Girl Named Imogen Says Bali Is Actually Pretty Nice If You Go To The Right Places

TEXT:

Imogen Airth (23) has quashed some stereotypes about the little Indonesian island of Bali today.

The part-time Yoga Instructor who still lives at home in the Betoota Ponds sat down with The Advocate and explained the bad wrap that Bali has been getting.

“Yeah for sure, Bali is definitely the overseas holiday for bogans and that, but you can get away from that and it’s actually pretty good if you know where to go,” she said.

“You shouldn’t be put off by some of the people who go there, and the growing stigma around the small Island just off East Java.”

The arts graduate told us that places like Seminyak and Nusa Dua are the way you should head if you want to get away from the crowds.

“Kuta is so fucking gross. Seriously.”

“Like in Seminyak, you can really avoid a lot of the trash Aussies and stuff”

Airth said that in the above mentioned nice places you don’t have to deal with all the people trying to sell you things to survive because consumerist Western tourism has completely destroyed their traditional way of life.

“There are way less of those street people there. It’s more spiritual as well I reckon,” said Airth who spent most of her recent trip to her catered Villa, Potato Heads or Ginger Moon restaurant.

Airth said that the key to setting yourself up for a nice holiday in Bali begins with the flight.

“You need to make sure that you don’t fly Jetstar. Otherwise, you are basically just sitting amongst all the people who are heading straight to Kuta for Bintangs, braids and butchered dog.”

Slight Cough At Risk Of Becoming Something Much More Serious If Body Forced To Exercise

‘Better to be safe than sorry’ has been the mantra of Chris Carey for the best part of her life. It has saved her from countless near death experiences and today it has prevented her sore throat from most likely turning into full-blown pneumonia.

Carey, a fun loving twenty-nine-year-old, was given a gym membership for Christmas by her boyfriend, who hoped to change both their exercise habits before his 30th birthday in June this year. However, the cunning Carey has managed to put off her first pump class for yet another day.

“Yeah (clears throat) it feels like it could develop into something more serious. You shouldn’t over exert yourself if you’re sick, so I reckon I might just sit out today’s session.”

“Wines on the other hand, they actually prevent sickness. I dunno [sic] the science behind it but something about them just cures any symptom.”

The Advocate reached out to Australia’s peak scientific body to get their professional opinion on the matter and to see if there was any truth behind Chris’s seemingly counterintuitive approach to his health. 

“Bottom line, no. Drinking will not cure a cold. But red wine will make you feel like you beat it” Explained Sam Sangiovese, lead researcher of the alcohol division at the CSIRO.

Upon relaying this information to Mz. Carey, she promptly skolled her water and order a bottle of the house pinot noir.

“Can’t argue with science” was Carey’s closing statement.

Majority Of Australian Worksite Accidents Found To Be She’ll-Be-Right-Related

TEXT:

A recent industry report has found that a vast majority of both minor, critical and fatal worksite injuries in Australia are directly related to someone saying ‘she’ll be right’ in the face of danger.

As defined by the Small-Sized Suburban Construction Contractors Union (SSSCCU) defines ‘work accident’, ‘workplace accident’, ‘occupational accident’, or ‘accident at work’ as a “discrete occurrence in the course of work” leading to physical or mental occupational injury.

While many incidents are results of oversight or inattentiveness, it is believed that even with these examples, the term ‘she’ll be right’ has been applied to the task prior to the injury.

The report found over 95% of asbestos related illness were directly linked to a dodgy foreman saying ‘she’ll be right’ or ‘don’t be a pussy’ – and 89% of all falls from height come from tradesmen she’ll-be-righting a questionable ladder.

“It’s not just corner-cutting” says SSSCCCU spokeswoman Sally McShorten.

“We have even seen examples of people using ‘she’ll be right’ to justify blatantly dangerous acts like putting forklifts into trucks with forklifts”

“Or throwing left over glass panes from two stories up into the back of a ute”

Other injury-causing terms of reference were found to be ‘what’ve you gone soft or something?” or “mate I don’t care if you went to uni, this how we get things done”

Silly Season’s Latest Casualty Revealed To Be This City Worker’s Belt

In November, Artie Pert was a svelt 81 kilograms ringing wet.

Now, the 26-year-old is getting called ‘big fella’ by strangers.

“I’m not that big,” he said to our reporter out the front of Blowes Menswear North Betoota.

“I’ve made holes in my belt from weight loss but never from being a man of heft. God this is depressing.”

His partner, Grettel Pearson, confided in The Advocate and told our reporter that Artie has been on a bit of a hedonistic binge on all of life’s forbidden fruits this summer – and the results speak for themselves.

“He is a big fella now, that’s for sure,” she said.

“I’ve certainly noticed a change in his diet and exercise regime. The former is no longer predominantly plant-based and the latter has disappeared from his life altogether,”

“Not that I can talk, I’m about ready to bust the zipper out of my favourite Zimmerman. The silly season has been tough on us both.”

Spice Girls Reunion Reignites Childhood Rivalries Over Who Gets To Be Sporty Spice

TEXT:

The news of a Spice Girls reunion sent waves through the millions of now adult fans scattered across the globe. And while the greater public hotly anticipated getting the girl group back together, for any true fan, it just reignited a fierce competition and rivalry that was thought to be long buried. 

Stacey Gunning (27) caught up with the Advocate earlier to enlighten us to the trauma she’s been reliving as a result of the reunion. 

“Well, I was always Sporty Spice. I was the sportiest person in my year, so it seemed like a natural fit. But then Courtney started at our school and she was also Sporty Spice. Courtney –“ Stacey broke off to regather herself. 

“Sorry. Courtney was horrible. She told me I wasn’t allowed to be Sporty and that I’d be better suited to Ginger. Ginger!” 

For those not familiar with the pop group, there are five members; Sporty, Scary, Baby, Posh and Ginger, all with ‘spice’ placed after their adjectival names. 

The group shot to fame in 1996 with their debut single ‘Wannabe’, a song which addresses the value of female friendship over a heterosexual bond. 

For our entertainment, we organised to have Stacey and Courtney in the same room and have them once again battle it out for the much-coveted Sporty spice position. 

“For God’s sake Stacey, give it up already. I am, and always will be, Sporty Spice” said Courtney. 

“Are you kidding? Courtney look at the size of you! It’s pretty obvious that any sporting ability you once had was left on the hockey field in year 6” retorted Stacey. 

It was at this point our reporters realised this was not a good idea and separated the women. Nevertheless, this experiment just highlights how influential the Spice Girls were on young Gen Y women.

Australian Pacific Islander Community Responsible For 90% Of All Crying Laugh Emojis

TEXT:

A recent report by Nielsen surveys regarding the social media behaviour of Australians has found that 90% of all crying laugh emojis posted from IP addresses located within this country have come Polynesian-Australian account holders.

“What we have found, purely through analytics is that Samoan, Tongan, Cook Islander and Fijian Australians tend to have social media presence quite similar to how you would find them in person” said one researcher.

“Except instead of the infectious high pitched giggles often heard on worksites and footy sheds, these behaviours are channeled into the iconic Face-With-Tears-Of-Joy emoji”

When presented with these findings, prominent members of Betoota’s Pacific Islander community were quick to point out that they also like to use the strong arm emoji, but definitely not as much as the laughie-cry.

The report also found that Aboriginal people on social media were responsible for majority of all yellow and black love hearts, while Baby Boomers of all nationalities were the number one users of side ways hysterical laughing emojis.

Mid-to-late twenties caucasian women were found to be the highest users of the pink fingernail, which in a concerning trend, quite often features the darker skin option.

The Australian alt-right community were the most common users of the snowflake and red cap emoji.

Thankfully though, we have the media behemoth News Corp Australia, willing to stand in the face of such issues and fight for us.

Forget reporting on rampant tax evasion which at a conservative estimate is robbing the Australian people of $50 billion a year, or even paying their own fair share of tax, here is a list of the 5 main issues sending this country down the gurgler.

1. Dole Bludgers

You might think that 380 large companies, like QANTAS, Exxon, Goldman Sachs, Energy Australia and News Corp not paying a cent of corporate tax in the last three years might gradually destroy some of the pillars of this great country like the universal right to education and healthcare.

However, as NewsCorp frequently reveals, it’s actually welfare recipients who are costing you, I and society in general.

Champion of an egalitarian society, Miranda Devine explained that “Centrelink recipients around this country are costing us many schools, hospitals and roads.”

2. The ABC

Do you know how much we pay to have leftist propaganda jammed down our throats?

$1 billion. That’s the size of the national broadcaster’s budget. Oddly enough they seem to be more willing to report on corporate tax evasion than News Corp’s mastheads, but that’s beside the point.

Despite exposing corruption, criminal activity and morally unscrupulous behaviour within broader Australia, the ‘Aunty’ as she is effectively known by communists, has been bordering on socialist for too long now, and that has rightfully drawn the ire of Murdoch’s papers.

3. Political Correctness

It is pretty well known now that Australia has become too politically correct.

Same-Sex Marriage, Safe Schools, identity politics and anti-male bias are just some of the hallmarks of political correctness gone wrong.

Thankfully though, rather than discuss the $4.5 billion worth of assets syphoned out of Australia by Murdoch’s companies in 2015 and 16, Andrew Bolt and Miranda are on the front line of the war against the PC renegades.

4. Migrants

In the last 40 years or so Australia has faced numerous issues with migrants coming to this country.

The steady wave from non-English speaking countries in Asia, the Middle East and Africa has caused a raft of societal issues that The Daily Telegraph, Herald Sun and Courier Mail have been exposing for a long time.

The most recent is the crisis African gang crime in Melbourne that has got so bad that the residents of the great southern capital are afraid to even leave their homes.

A prominent News Limited editor told The Advocate that if people think that News Corp running at a loss and minimising tax is worthy of a story, they have rocks in their head.

“African gang crime is the real issue affecting people, not fucking tax evasion champ,” he said to us today.

5. Indigenous Australians Who Aren’t Thankful For What Colonialism Has Done For Them

There are some Indigenous Australians, and lefties who would have us all living in guilt every day.

The champions of the black armband view of history, should take a leaf out of ‘Uncle Ruperts’ minion’s books, and appreciate what makes this great country what it is today.

A prominent News Corp columnist summed it up perfectly when he said that “People need to forget about the systemic oppression of Indigenous Australians which amounted to the definition of genocide, and try to work together to create a harmonious society.”

So, there you have it. 5 issues that make perfect distractions from the fact that the largest media organisation in Australia doesn’t pay tax!

Tropical Goth Praised For Commitment To Trench Coat On Townsville Esplanade

TEXT:

A ‘tropical’ Goth from Far North Queensland has been praised today for his dedication to the dark, heavy clothing associated with his subculture, despite the very visible health affects it is causing him.

The Cairns original and devoted fan of Nine Inch Nails and Joy Division has today been left cooked to a crisp, after spontaneously combusting during his morning walk along Townsville Esplanade.

As firefighters began investigating the incident, the family of Ian Morrissey revealed that this year has been his most challenging in terms of skulking around town in his preferred attire: Black jeans, black docs and a black trench coat. 2018 has seen the hottest summer temperatures since Ian first heard Marilyn Manson’s cover of ’Tainted Love’ back in 2001.

“Moz has really struggled this year” said Ian’s Mother, Siouxsie. “We bought him another Cowboys singlet for Christmas but he just threw it in the cupboard with the rest”.

Nick, Ian’s father, said that after a few drinks recently, Ian had finally opened up about his fashion choices. “He said it was a statement of non-conformity, wanted to stay true to himself or his identity or something. I don’t know. I’m just glad he didn’t tell me he was playing basketball or something suss like though”.

Whilst not being a follower of Rugby League (he does like Thurston though), Morrissey also admitted that this year he had been particularly envious of the locals at the RSL, who proudly wear the merchandise of the local and national teams in what appears to be the ultimate in tropical comfort and practicality. 

“Yeah it’s tough” he conceded. “It’s really fucking hot man. I’m having recurring dreams of just kicking around town in nothing but a pair of those silky bad boys”

Investigations continue.

Panics Sets In As Cashier Finishes Up Swiping Groceries With Mum Nowhere In Sight

TEXT:

An overimaginative local 8 year old is freaking the fuck out at Betoota Woolies tonight, after realising that the grocery store cashier is almost done swiping all of the items and his mum still hasn’t come back from ‘running back to pick up a few things she forgot’.

Tyler Weston, 8, had been asked to wait in line at the cashier as his Mum went back to grab some ‘Mummy things’ from the magazine and women’s health aisle, but had not been prepared to deal with her not coming back in time to make the payment.

“Oh god where is she?? I can’t pay for this, I have no money!!”, several on-lookers claimed he said loudly to himself.

Despite having no money and also being 8 years old, Mr. Weston is reportedly convinced that, should the cashier finish booking all of the items before his mum returns, the financial burden will fall upon his tiny 8 year-old hands, and that he’ll face dire consequences for not being able to fulfil his obligations.

“They’re going to arrest me for not being able to pay! I can’t go to jail! Who’s going to look after my Animal Crossing town??”

According to multiple reports, Mr. Weston’s situation has not been helped by the fact that several small families have begun to line up behind him with their trolleys, and are waiting for him intently to finish his transaction and take his supplies home.

“Oh god, it’s worse than prison. They’re all going to start yelling at me, aren’t they??”

Mr. Weston says he is now assessing all of his options.

“Maybe I can convince everyone to be patient for like two minutes until mum gets back. It’ll either be that or I run away and change my name”

Mr. Weston says he has no idea how he got into this mess, claiming that his mum PROMISED she would be right back.

Single Bloke Trying To Stay Off The Piss Hits Up Driving Range For 4th Time This Week

TEXT:

In a similar vein to the ‘New year, New me’ kind of thing, Albert Jensen has tried to change his life recently.

Waking on Sunday morning with a splitting headache, an empty wallet, and clammy sweats after making a fool of himself the previous night, the Betoota Heights-based plumber decided it was time to jump on the wagon.

Other than gambling, Jensen told us he struggles identifying many hobbies that don’t involve tipping a few.

“I’m not gonna give it away completely. I just need a couple of weeks to clear my head and get moderately healthy again,” said the bachelor who has let himself go a bit in the offseason.

Jensen explains that without the social skills to go out and find himself a girlfriend in a normal environment where he isn’t filled to the brim with piss, he was honestly stuck as what to do with himself.

“So I thought to myself, what can I do to keep myself occupied other than knocking the top of a few or chasing some donkeys down at the pub.”

“And I had a light bulb moment, driving range! Bingo.”

“What the hell else is there to do”

However, it appears that the novelty is now starting to wear off a little bit.

As he creamed one a few hundred metres deep on his lonesome session at the range this afternoon, Jensen confirmed that he is starting to get a little bit bored of the whole thing.

“I don’t like golf really. I just enjoy fucking belting ball after ball onto the grass. And now, the group chat is lighting up because it’s the weekend.”

“I’m not far off caving, honestly. Help me stay strong” he begged one of our reporters.

“Wanna catch a movie?”

Labor Hires Bernard Tomic To Count The Millions Wasted On NBN

TEXT:

Following the newly released ‘Cabinet Files’ –  based on an astonishing collection of files found in an abandoned filing cabinet in a second-hand shop in Canberra, the Labor party has been quick to steer any criticism from the young blokes that got killed filling roofs with insulation a few years back.

This means the National Broadband Network (NBN) is back in the headlines, after years of documents featuring top secret information on the internal workings of five different Australian governments were leaked to the ABC – with the most damning Turnbull related leaks related to files discussing the NBN.

Labor have today announced that they have hired Australian tennis star-turned-reality-TV-personality, Bernard Tomic to head up an independent commission aimed at counting the millions that have been spend on the copper-wire Australian internet service.

Shorten, who has been a big fan of Tomic since his spikey-hair-braces days, was asked if maybe 13-14 million dollars had been blown on the anti-climatic National Broadband Network.

“What we need is someone who can count money. Someone who knows how to count millions”

While standing next to Opposition Leader Bill Shorten today on a break from the Celebrity AU promo tour, Tomic told reporters that he was definitely the best man for the job.

“I just count money, that’s all I do”

The ever-showboating 25-year-old has made headlines quite a lot recently, after walking journalists through his vintage Mazda collection last week to show everyone how rich he is.

Local Restaurant Now Successful Enough To Have To Worry About Rich People Allergies

TEXT:

A modern fusion restaurant in Betoota’s bustling inner-city suburb of Greviequa has today proudly declared that they are now so popular that they have to worry about made up allergies that rich people diagnose themselves with to feel alive.

Having only opening in November last year, Australasia, has already been featured on a viral Facebook video that shows one of their chefs blowtorching a toffee apple.

“It’s unprecedented” says Australasia owner Sarah Lee

“We knew we were getting pretty good reviews on Yelp… But never thought we’d be at the point where people come in here and start altering our menus to suit themselves”

“It’s a great sign for the year to come”

Greviequa, which is a syllabic abbreviation from Greek/Vietnamese Quarter has been popular for those suffering from trend allergies for many years now, as the city’s bourgeoise attempt to identify some sort of struggle in their life.

Local stay-at-home boutique Balinese-made jewellery importer, Chloe La Pierre, says it’s great to find a restaurant that is willing to forgoe lactose, gluten, fructose, fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols.

“There’s not many places that can cater for me, and my children” she says.

“Thankfully Australasia allows you to basically reformat their entire specials list to suit whatever allergy you think you might have”

Poor Contribution To BBQ Justified By The Fact That These 4 Sausages Have Herbs In Them

TEXT:

A local man has tried to make amends for the fact that he didn’t bring anywhere near enough drinks, any form of salad and some mediocre chat to a BBQ with a small packet of herby sausages.

After immediately realising he had left himself short, Sam Krilic offered his 4 pack of mass produced sausages to the host with the statement “Red Thai Curry, mate. They are really nice.”

Host Connor Watson smiled politely and thanked him for the morsels, knowing full well that he would berate Krilic later on that day after a few beers.

Watson told The Advocate that Krilic has a long standing reputation amongst friends for being a bit of a scab.

“He is that person that brings 2 beers to a BBQ, or doesn’t bring anything at all and just hopes no one says anything,” said Watson.

“He is a nice fella and all, but is often guilty of hanging around after a beer for a free meal and then disappearing as soon as someone looks like they are going to start washing up.”

Other guests at the BBQ confirmed the allegations levelled at Krillic, but similarly somewhat accepted his behaviour based upon the fact he was a reasonably likely person who dealt well with being given a lot of shit.

“Yeah he wouldn’t shout if a shark bit him, but fuck he cops it well. We spray him about his increasingly balding noggin, his tight penny attitude and his general dress sense but he always seems to laugh it off. It makes him good to have around I guess.”

Real Estate Agent With Degree In Sound Engineering Reckons Now Is A Great Time To Buy

TEXT:

Despite looming concerns about the state of Australia’s housing market, one local Real Estate Agent assured us today that everything is going to be okay.

“Now is a fantastic time to buy,” Angus Black told one of our reporters.

“The market is booming. Absolutely booming. We are seeing year on year incredible returns in the housing market. It’s the safest place to put your money,” he said almost convincingly.

As Australia’s property market has now been classified as “severely unaffordable” according to a recent study from Demographia, and supply is finally starting to meet demand in terms of occupation of premises, we asked Black whether it was his instictive self-preservation talking.

“No mate. I am as straight as an arrow. I tell ya (sic) how it is. No nonsense, no rubbish from me.”

“The commission is barely even at the back of my mind when I am opening doors for homebuyers,” he said as he flicked through his phone while people wandered around during a home inspection in the Ponds.

The man who has been working in Real Estate for 18 months after finishing a university degree in sound production told us that the only way is up for house prices in the country,

“My piece of advice would be, get in now, before it’s too late and you’ve missed the boat.”

Wanda Carson from the School Of Economics at Betoota Polytechnic shook her head when we told her what young Black told us.

“You know how the term cowboys is associated with concreters, demo labourers that sort of ilk? Well, Real Estate agents need to be lumped in with them,” she said.

“Interests rates are at record lows, new building work is still at extremely high levels despite the demand actually slowing, and the rate of income to debt in Australia is scary at the moment.”

“In my opinion, Australians should be focusing on learning to ride a horse and hunt wild animals”

BREAKING: January Is Almost Over And You Haven’t Achieved Shit

TEXT:

In breaking news this evening, it can be revealed that the first of twelve months in the 2018 calendar year is almost at an end – and you may as well still be hungover watching test match cricket at your parent’s house because that’s how much you have achieved in the 20 days you’ve had back at work.

Other reports indicate that you are still as overweight, if not more overweight than you were on news years day, and you actually haven’t stopped drinking piss since the Melbourne Cup.

With the first long weekend of 2019 about to take place, you may as well give up on any goals you might have had leading into the new year. You lazy sack of shit.

Also, Dry July is also a fair few months off, so any attempts at bringing yourself into check and altering your self destructive lifestyle – without the veil of charity – will be laughed at by your family and friends, as we all know you aren’t really gonna take it seriously and commit to a real health kick.

At time of press, it was reported that you were trying to laugh off the introspective article you just read about yourself, while also comparing yourself to your few friends that live an even more dysfunctional life than you.

Local Girl Sends 83 Drunken Texts Explaining She Doesn’t Need Toxic People In Her Life

TEXT:

After making excuses to get out of an arranged dinner date, Sally Westington (27), sits at her Betoota Cove apartment drinking alone and scouring over social media. Unfortunately, her moment of bliss was cut short when the Virgo saw a photo of two of her best friends having dinner together – the very friends she blew off.  

Immediately screenshotting the Instagram post, Sally sent the photo to her 4th, 5th and 6th best friends, expressing her dislike for the image. Monique, the 6th best friend, was the only one who replied.  

“Can you believe these two?” accompanied the photo in a text message. 

“What’s the big deal?” replied her filler friend, Monique. 

“I was meant to be there!” said one message. 

“I can’t believe they went without me.” Said another. 

“We are 27 now” and another. 

“I don’t need to be dealing with these toxic bitches anymore.” And another. 

Knowing Sally’s loose lipped track record, Monique knew better than to agree with Sally’s bitching, so she replied with a neutral ‘Mhmm’. 

The following week, Monique alerted our reporters to an Instagram post of Sally’s, a boomerang that see’s Sally and her two aforementioned best friends cheersing their Aperol Spritz with the caption “T H E S E  T W O <3”   

Monique then went on to explain that Sally was in fact the most toxic person in their friendship group, often letting her jealousy get in the way of common sense and rationality and to “not trust a word she says.”

The Girls Decide On A Round Of Espresso Martinis With The Bar Six Deep And One Bartender On

TEXT:

Bartender and mixologist Andy Samson could feel some eyes burning holes in him this afternoon as he frantically tried to get through an overly burdensome cocktail order.

The part time employee at the Royal Coke Hotel in Betoota’s Data Entry District was meandering his way through the afternoon shift, pulling happy hour beer after happy hour beer.

That was until Georgia Anson walked up and asked for three Lychee Mojito’s.

“You are fucking having a laugh aren’t you,” was the internalised rhetorical question Samson asked himself at 5.47pm.

“Not fucking lychee mojito’s again. Why do these fucking people like mojito’s. Maybe if you were relaxing on a beach in Havana, but we are in a town in the Diamantina Shire for fucks sake,” he continued to rant behind a smile, while muddling up the mint leaves.

“Piece of fucking shit fucking mint leaves. Essential oils in them aye?” he thought while trying to avoid making eye contact with any of the growing number of patrons trying to get their fill before the happy hour specials ceased.

Samson told us that he made the decision to verbally acknowledge the customers a few minutes after, in an attempt to make Anson uncomfortable for the order.

“Sorry guys, I’ll try and be with you but these Mojitos might take a while so maybe head to the bar upstairs?” he said.

“She didn’t even look up when I said that. Just kept staring at her phone,” he scowled to The Advocate.

Barista Asserts Authority By Loudly Referring To Your Skim Cappuccino As “Skinny Cap!”

TEXT:

For young professional Calum Jones (26) ordering a large skim cappuccino is hard enough to do without feeling judged, especially at his local cafe where barista Isaac Banon (30) asserts authority by loudly announcing Jones’s order as “tall skinny cap!”

“It’s bullshit. He knows my name, he asks for it, still yells out “tall skinny cap” every time anyway. Fuckwit.”

Jones says a large cappuccino on skim milk became his drink of choice due to his need for additional caffeine with a hint of chocolate while also trying to be a little healthy.

While not overly embarrassed by his coffee order, Jones admits it’s somewhat emasculating when Banon announces his order as a “skinny cap!”

“Where did he get skinny from? You don’t go to the shops and buy skinny milk. He’s doing it to fuck with me I swear.”

We reached out to Isaac Banon for comment and he immediately confirmed Jones’s suspicions.

“It’s what WE call it”

Banon states that while he believes toxic masculinity might be a problem, that doesn’t mean he’s going to stop referring to Jones’s skim cappuccino as anything but a skinny cap.

“I work here 50 hours a week and I just got my penalty rates cut. Calum makes more in a quarter than I do in a year sitting on his ass and leering at interns. Fuck him, let him have his skinny cap alright.”

Nation’s Commodore Owners Urged To Give Her Some

The nation’s Commodore drivers have today been urged to go on then, and to also send it.

This follows a recent report by the National Roads and Motorists’ Association has found that high-speed driving is not nearly as cool unless you flop your sloppy pale arm out the window while doing it.

In a report commissioned in 2014 by former NRMA chairman and former Manly Sea Eagles coach Mr Toovey, researchers have concluded that the ‘arm-hang’ is key to signifying you are king of the road.

“I was always interested in this particularl element of motorist culture” said the great man, Toovs.

“As is the only member-owned mutual organisation offering roadside assistance, motoring advice, car servicing, International Driving Permits, travel and other services in NSW and the ACT – this report was key to figuring out who actually is king of the road”

Lead researcher, Brock Lowndes says the study including interviews with over 2000 arm-hangers, most of which were Holden Commodore or Monaro drivers.

“We learnt many things about these highway big dogs” said Professor Lownes.

“They are occasionally Ford driver too, but rarely”

Another interesting revelation throughout the report was the recurring ‘King’s Tan’ – identified as unsymmetrical sun burn or weathered skin on the right arm of the drivers.

“The King’s Tan is only something that happens to you if you are the King Of The Road” said the researcher.

“Or if you are a truckie”

Elon Musk Promises To Make Summernats 100% Renewable By Next Year Or It’s Free

TEXT:

The 2018 Summernats car festival ended yesterday, however, news of the fully-charged-high-horsepower-high-pollution event has only just reached the United States of America, more specifically, the popular energy entrepreneur, Elon Musk.

Where most people curse the car festival for the unapologetic noise and environmental pollution it causes every year, Musk sees it as an opportunity. Reaching out exclusively to The Advocate earlier today, Elon made yet another bold and momentous promise to the people of Australia. 

“By January 3 2019, I will make sure the Summernats horsepower party will be the cleanest and greenest car festival on Earth” he exclaimed. 

“And to show how serious I am, if it takes me longer than 359 days, I’ll foot the bill!” 

While many Australians would welcome a quieter and cleaner festival, there’s a concentrated minority who think Musk has gone too far this time. 

“Is he fucken’ serious?” roared Tyson, a street machine enthusiast from West Betoota, who makes the pilgrimage to Canberra every year.  

“His electric bullshit wouldn’t even make the 1800km trip to the Berra [sic]”

“Nup.” He ended on.

The Advocate reached out to the residents of Canberra’s bustling Lonsdale St – the 600m hot-lap hot-spot of festival goers – to hear their thoughts on Musk’s proposal, which, unsurprisingly, were all very positive.    

“I think it’s a fantastic idea. I didn’t pay $1 million for an apartment just to have these petrol heads set up camping chairs at my front door.” 

“Not to mention the racket!” 

Following the success of Elon’s previous renewables promise, Australians should be quietly optimistic about another.

Local Chicken Shop Feels The Wrath Of 1 Star Review From Joint Facebook Account

After a negative experience at a local chicken shop, semi-retirees Lionel and Linda decided to take matters all the way to the top by complaining on the business’s Facebook page.

From their shared account, LindaandLionel Norman, the couple posted this 1-star review on the Facebook page of Juicy Charcoal Takeaway:

“I had to wait 20 bloody minutes before someone told me I hadn’t ordered. There wasn’t enough chicken salt on the chips, chicken salt goes nice with chips so why wasn’t there any? And they gave it to me in a bag even though I said I could just carry it. The girl or boy or whatever it was at the counter was hopeless and needs to learn proper English please!”

Since posting the review Linda states they have s not received any reply from the company despite refreshing the page every couple of minutes.

Following the lack of action from Juicy Charcoal Takeaway, Lionel Norman commented on a photo of hot chips the takeaway restaurant posted in 2013 stating: “bet you mongrels forgot the chicken salt on those too! – Lionel”

While he is not 100% sure he likes social media, Norman is happy to be given an opportunity to take matters into his own hands and complain directly to the low-level employee whose thankless job it is to maintain the business’s social media presence.

Norman states that while he is disappointed by the lack of response from Juicy Charcoal Takeaway he is glad he now has the internet at his disposal so he can share his true feelings with everyone who has ever annoyed him.

“I’ve got big plans once my grandson teaches me how to use the Twitter. Not wanting to spoil anything but if you’re a bald cockhead named David Kochie you better watch out.”

Only Person That Didn’t Bring Chair To Festival Campsite Somehow Always Sitting In One

A friend who arrived wildly unprepared at a shared campsite for a popular East Coast music festival does not appear to be apologetic about the game of musical chairs he has created.

It seems good mate, Jase Tidwell (27) has only made sure to bring hard liquor and other non-permitted goodies through the gates this year, as his Hyundai Getz is showing no signs of an esky or picnic chair.

“Oi I bought some sausages on the way into town, and some bread” he says while smoking a cigarette and relaxing in a brand new BCF fishing chair that doesn’t belong to him.

“Was gonna get a hot chook but didn’t think there’d be anywhere to keep it”

Close friend, Anna, says Jase doesn’t even realise when someone who bought a chair is forced to sit on the ground, and all he needed to do was bring a milk crate or something.

“People come back from the bathrooms and have to try and sit on the front of a car” she says.

“Jase actually appears to be sitting down more than anyone else here”

With talk of pre-drinks before heading into the actual grounds, Jase appears to be pushing towards making a massive punch, where everyone pours a bit of grog in each.

“Jeez, Party At Your Place Tonight?” Says Smart Arse In Bottle Shop

TEXT:

A local half-wit has taken delight in poking fun at the amount of grog currently being purchased by the customer queued in front of him at The Betoota Family Cellars today.

The smart arse, who appears to be buying one six pack of shit looking beer, appears to be waiting for a Olympic applause after rattling out probably the most used bottle shop related one-liner in Australia since the rum rebellion.

The joke was reported to be pointed at trolley full of different brands of wine, suggesting the customer is taking a big hit to the wallet hosting Christmas celebrations, and is not actually hosting a house party, or any other party that a random bloke in a suburban bottle shop would be interested in attending.

“Haha I’m coming over to your house” he follows up, while nodding at the yet-to-be purchased bottles of wine in the trolley.

“Looks like the place to be haha”

The customer, a stressed out middle-aged woman currently hosting six of her extended families for the Christmas break, does respond, but it becomes clear by her facial expression that the lippy stranger is definitely not invited to come over her place tonight.

Designated Drivers Advised To Steer Clear Of Nan’s Rum Balls

TEXT:

Police have issued a warning to all designated drivers today: Stay away from Nan’s Rum Balls.

The warning comes after a spate of DUI’s across the country, directly linked to consumption of the potent Christmas sweet.

Diamantina Police Spokesperson Troy Pisasale confirmed that over 50 people have returned positive breath tests during the Christmas period.

“I understand that people are just trying to enjoy themselves, but we are urging caution in regards to Rum Balls made by grandparents.”

“I enjoy the dessert as much everyone else. But, if you are driving and you consume them you will get yourself into trouble with the law.”

Head of The Betoota Country Womens Association, Marg Wilson told us that Rum Balls made by people over the age of 75 are dangerous.

“You see, Grandmas get to a certain point where they don’t care as much. I mean I pour most of the bottle of Bundy into my mix. It makes things more exciting.”

Betoota Ponds local Coen Ramsey said he blew over after a few Rum Balls yesterday.

“They had a serious kick to them. I thought, surely I will be right. But obviously not. Double Demerits fucking stings,” Ramsey said.

Pisasale said that while it is unfortunate, Police encourage the consumption of other sweets.

“I am aware that Fruit Salad is a very average dessert. But it will keep people on our roads safe,” he said.

“Gee Its Hot!” Says Baby Boomer Who Doesn’t Know What To Say To His Son’s Boyfriend

TEXT:

A local Betoota man is trying his level best to have a conversation with his son’s boyfriend today, after both of them dropped by the family home for an early Christmas lunch this afternoon.

Barry Bilson, 56, has always prided himself on being a good father to his son, also Barry. However, his traditionally conservative upbringing and his relative lack of experience with “all that gay stuff” means he doesn’t always know what to say when it comes to his son’s love life. For example, not saying things like “all that gay stuff”.

However, Barry is committed to making an effort with his son’s new boyfriend, also Barry, and he’s hoping he the two can bond over the massive heatwave currently smothering large parts of the country.

“How about this heat, eh?” he says, hoping the word ‘heat’ isn’t some weird sex thing he doesn’t understand. “Phwoah, it’s a bit of a hot one!”

“Tell ya what, it’s about as hot as Hades today. Er, not that you’re going to hell or anything. Not saying that at all”

Despite his efforts, however, Barry still has a long way to go in his journey.

Issue With PayPol Easily Fixed With A Quick $10K Deposit Into Unrelated Westpac Account

TEXT:

A local Betoota scam artist is waiting with bated breath today, after launching a brand new worldwide con involving sending people emails from financial giant ‘Poypal’.

The man, who we interviewed on condition of anonymity, is optimistic that his latest scheme is a winner, and that most people would skim over the fact that that’s not how you spell Paypal.

“Honestly, I’m excited about this one”, he said in the interview. “Everyone’s always saying things like, ‘Barry, you’re never going to trick anyone with these emails’, or ‘Mr. Roberts, why did you quit your job to do this’ or ‘People are dumb, but they’re not THAT dumb’”

“But you see, people ARE that dumb. I should know, I’m people too”.

The scam itself, which we can reveal here for the first time, involves an intricate series of communications between the scam artist and any prospective ‘mark’. First, the mark receives an email from ‘Poypal’ saying that their account is about to be deleted, unless they deposit $10,000 to an unrelated Westpac Bank account number. At this point, says the artist, the money starts rolling in.

“I mean, it’s fool-proof! There’s no way people DON’T fall for it. As sure as I live at 15 Baird St, Betoota, this is guaranteed to make me a millionaire!”

While Miller usually enjoys a weekend of late mornings and day drinking, even the chance of a sneaky couple of beers is looking unlikely as the 28-year-old mulls over the impending loads of laundry, interior rearranging, grocery shopping, parental visit and dreaded trip to IKEA he has been avoiding for too long.

Friends of Miller state there is a deeper reason for the recruiter’s sudden need of life admin.

“His girlfriend is moving in next week and he has done fuck all to prepare for it so far. Guess he won’t be round for Saturday beers! He said Sunday beers were a maybe.”

For Miller, the first step in making it through this fucker of a weekend will be accepting that he is not going to have any fun at all.

“I’m getting used to it. Weekends are getting less and less fun, by not getting my hopes up at least I’m giving myself some opportunity to be happy.”

Those close to Miller say obligations are not the only reason his weekends are becoming increasingly full of adult activities. Reports have circulated Miller has even purchased a book as a way to spend his time relaxing this weekend.

“He’s just getting old mate. We’ve all got laundry that needs doing and furniture that needs to be replaced. Doesn’t mean we’re going to ruin our weekend over it.”

Miller denies these accusations wholeheartedly, stating he wishes he could spend his weekend drinking to relax instead of finding long-term satisfaction from organising his life for the better.

Somewhat conflicted by his need to stay youthful and urge to keep order, Miller knows one thing for sure;

“Leaving IKEA is going to be a massive relief, don’t you worry about that.”

Clive Palmer Begins Firing M16 At Queensland Nickel Liquidators In Dramatic Final Stand

TEXT:

Clive Palmer has been spotting wielding an M16 machine gun at on the top floor of his Coolum mansion today, while knocking off representatives from the liquidation agency probing into the collapse of Queensland nickel.

The victims of this hail of gunfire say they will seek to have Clive Palmer found in contempt of court if he does not hand over financial documents relating to the company.

The documents were supposed to be produced to the Federal Court in Brisbane on Thursday and Mr Palmer’s lawyers were unable to provide them on Friday morning.

It is believed after arriving at Palmer’s Sunshine Coast residence this morning, the liquidators were met with immediate hostility, as the former Federal MP and Joh-era entrepreneur greeted them from the top of a marble staircase.

“You wait for me. I’m coming back.”

Within minutes Mr Palmer returned from his master bedroom with a 5.56 mm calibre M16 rifle, before addressing his uninvited guests as ‘cockroaches’.

Queensland Nickel collapsed with debts of about $300 million leaving 800 workers at its Yabulu refinery in Townsville in north Queensland out of work.

While Mr Palmer was not a director when Queensland Nickel collapsed, liquidators claim he was secretly running the company and using its funds to bankroll other businesses and his now-defunct political party.

Speaking to The Betoota Advocate after the violent massacre, Clive Palmer says he believes Sir Joh and the Thiess brothers would be rolling in their grave this morning upon learning off all the unnecessary heat being put on a fair dinkum grogposter like himself.

“Jeez no wonder nothing gets done in this country. I’m just trying to dig a little bit of mineral out of the ground and they treat me like an enemy of the state!”

“Wendy Deng is a Chinese Spy! Why aren’t you all going after Murdoch!”

Ch9 Executive Just Wishes He’d Been In A Position To Stop Burke When He Was Burke’s Boss

TEXT:

Prominent ex-Channel Nine executive Daniel Gycker OAM says he has been rattled by the allegations made about Don Burke and published overnight in a joint Fairfax and ABC investigation.

The former high-ranking Channel 9 boss has gone on the record to say that he always thought ‘Donnie was a bit suss’ and “possibly a sexual offender that wielded too much power in the position he was afforded by the organisation that I was instrumental in running at the time”.

Gycker’s comments comes after  Australian TV legend Don Burke has been accused of indecent assault, sexual harassment and bullying of women during his time as the golden boy of Channel 9, and star of his own gardening show, Burke’s Backyard.

Journalists have uncovered claims from a number of women who worked with Burke in the late 1980s and 1990s, and he has been compared to the likes of Hollywood sexual abuser, Harvey Weinstein, with women all over the world revealing their experiences of workplace sexual harassment.

“I just can’t believe all of those things that I had imagined being true, actually were” says a distressed and concerned Gycker.

“How did he get away with it?”

“I just wish I was able to do something about it at the time”

“You, know, by intervening and stopping him from doing all the sexual harassment on the set of one of the biggest earning television programmes in Australia at the time”

Local Woman Survives Family Event With Series Of Trips To Bathroom To Look At Phone

TEXT:

What was meant to be a fun event for anyone over 30 has turned into a nightmare for Michelle Handley (29) who managed to survive the family BBQ by pretending to go to the toilet in order to check her phone.

The BBQ in question was Handley’s first family event since splitting with her partner Sal, prompting all sorts of questions Handley was unprepared for in the wake of the Same Sex Marriage postal survey results.

These intrusive questions have forced her to seek refuge in her grandparent’s en suite to check her phone.

“People might think I have an STI but I don’t care. In here I don’t have to answer any of aunt Rhonda’s ‘gay questions’ and I have a chance to finally beat this Candy Crush level.”

Handley later revealed, ‘gay questions’ are not the only inquisitions she’s had to field at this family event.

“‘Do you think you’re ready to move on yet?’, ‘Do you miss her?’ Uncle Keith straight up asked if I was going to try dating a man this time! Honestly, if my grandparent’s didn’t have this bathroom I’d of drowned myself in the esky by now.”

Members of Handley’s family have their own opinions about why their niece/granddaughter/cousin made so many trips to the bathroom during the event. According to her Uncle Keith:

“It’s probably just that time of the month! Would explain why she is so grumpy too! Haha!”

“I don’t know if going to the toilet is a lesbian thing or anything, but if she’s smart she’ll give that bathroom a miss for a while because I was just there… and I was really tucking into Erma’s devilled eggs before if you know what I mean!”

Katter Calls For $120m Plebiscite On Whether Crocs Should Be Allowed To Eat North Queenslanders

TEXT:

Maverick MP Bob Katter has today renewed calls for a new $120 million plebiscite into whether crocodiles should be allowed to eat North Queenslanders or not.

Katter stated, in a press release, that he believes it is every Australian’s right to have a say in whether or not North Queenslanders were worth keeping around.

“Frankly, this is one of the biggest and most pressing issues of our time. Even bigger than that whole marriage equality thing – this one affects everyone”

“And these bleeding hearts whitefellas aren’t helping. We had a lot less croc attacks when it was just my brother cousins up here keeping the population low”

“We all know a North Queenslander – they’re our co-workers, they’re our league players, and some of them are even our friends. And it’s high time we all came together and gave them the basic human right of not being devoured by a large croc. But that’s for Australia to decide”

Katter’s plea for North Queensland equality comes in stark contrast to the Australian Conservatives, who issued their own statement in response to this new call.

“The Australian Conservatives believe, first and foremost, that a meal is between a crocodile and a North Queenslander. Any attempts to change the definition of this is to disrespect the very foundation of Crocodile religion – and we will fight for our right to express this view”

“Also, Safer Schools is bad and we’d much prefer to spend $120 million dollars on deciding what to do with Christian bakers who don’t want to make gay cakes”

Complimentary Mentos Enough To Spur Punter Into Feeding Another Pineapple Through

TEXT:

As they always say, there ain’t no such thing as a free lunch. If ever the adage rang true, it was this weekend, as a Fremantle punter learnt the value of some “free” lollies.

Popping in for a couple of beers with some mates on the weekend, Phil Walsh, a business analyst at a reputable firm thought he would duck into the VIP room for a quick slap.

As he fed a lobster through More Chilli, the late 20’s bachelor reached for a handful of individually packaged fruit flavoured mentos.

Although the credit in the machine disappeared in a flash, the thought of a couple more fruity treats spurred Walsh into grabbing a 50 dollar note out of his wallet and pumping it in.

“They get ya don’t they. Between the cups of mentos and the free party pies it’s all too easy,” he said.

A short time later, with a long sigh and $70 down, Walsh finished his schooner, grabbed a couple more mentos and exited to the dimly lit and morbidly depressing enclave in the pub

“Ah well, that’s the way it goes aye. Gotta spend money to make money,” he said to his mates with a resigned laugh.

“At least you got some mentos out of it. Pretty expensive Mentos though hey ha ha ha ha,” quipped his smartass friend.

No Campaign Blames Result On Lower Number Of No Voters

TEXT:

In a decision that has shocked no one, over 70% of the Australian public voted in favour of legalising same sex marriage on the controversial postal survey.

Across the country, the queer community and allies have joined together to celebrate the support against one of the last vestiges of inequality in the Australian constitution.

One not so happy voter, is head of the Australian Christian Lobby Lyle Shelton who is blaming the Yes verdict on the lack of people voting No.

“It’s completely unfair. This is not taking into account the amount of people who would have voted ‘no’ but didn’t because they have a moral conscience.”

Despite the results from the Australian Bureau of Statistics showing that each state voted in favour of marriage equality, Shelton states this a bias towards the majority of voters.

“I expect this behaviour from Victorians but it’s Tasmania that really surprises me. I expected better from them.”

“Since when did the majority start getting their way all the time?”

Not giving up, Shelton is hopeful that a marriage equality bill will fail parliament.

“I’ll be praying that our pollies do the right thing and ignore the wishes the majority of Australia. It will be God’s will.”

The leading voices that make up the Christian right behind the No Campaign have today hit out at their unfair treatment at the hands of everyday Australians.

“It’s not fair” says Shelton.

“We have been bullied by a majority of the Australian voters into listening to their collective feelings about this whole this whole issue”

As confirmed moments ago by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the people of Australia have voted in favour of changing the law to allow same-sex marriage.

Australian Statistician David Kalisch announced the results of the ABS postal survey from Canberra, confirming the survey had delivered a Yes result. Of 12.7 million votes, 61 per cent were returned in favour of same-sex marriage.

The final participation rate accounted for 79.5 per cent of eligible voters, most of whom decided that gays can get married and who gives a fuck.

Tony Abbott is believed to be now working towards creating a nest of hyper-political red tape to prevent the marriage act from being changed before the next election.

Townsville Council Propose 80 Metre ‘JT The Redeemer’ Sculpture On Top Of Castle Hill

TEXT:

Townsville mayor Jenny Hill has today announced a proposal to erect a 328 ft soapstone statue of Cowboys captain and future rugby league immortal, Johnathan Thurston, on top of the iconic pink granite monolith ‘Castle Hill’ which overshadows the North Queensland capital.

Modelled off the iconic art deco sculptor of Christ the Redeemer in Brazil’s Rio de Janeiro, the statue will expected to be paid for by both the local council and Federal Government’s Northern Australia development fund.

The idea was allegedly bought to life after an overwhelming majority of the residents of Townsville listed their official religion as ‘rugby league’ in the 2016 census.

“Not sure if it was the Royal Commission into the Catholics or the 2015 Grand Final, but the people have spoken. JT is the most prominent religious figure in North Queensland, and we will pay our respects to our local demigod in an appropriate way”

This announcement comes after the news that State of Origin hero was named the 2018 Queenslander of the Year for his work off the rugby league field.

The North Queensland Cowboys captain received the honour for his work as an Indigenous mentor at an awards function in Brisbane on Wednesday night.

Thurston was reached for comment but he was too busy rescuing an old lady from a burning building while also signing autographs for the hard-working fireys inside.

Thirsty Merc Counting Down The Days To Peak Summertime Music Royalty Season

TEXT:

As the days stretch out and the heats sets in, many Australians look forward to the warm and enticing embrace of the summer down under. For lead singer of Thirsty Merc, Rai Thistlethwayte, the seasonal excitement of the average Aussie pales in comparison to his.

“Heh heh heh, royalty season is on the way! December first can’t come soon enough mate!”

Formed in 2002, Thirsty Merc is an Australian pop-rock group most noted for their 2004 Aria nominated self-titled album and out-of-vogue hair and goatee combinations.

Many Australian’s remember them for their 2005 hit single, In The Summertime, a song described my Australian radio announcer Myf Warhurst as:

“..like Vegemite, VB or avoiding a loud ice addict the beach. You can’t really have an Aussie summer without it.”

According to Thistlethwayte, the track’s synonymous nature with the Australian summer has been the continued source of abundant spiritual and financial gain for the Dubbo four-piece who have enjoyed a spike of relevance every summer for the past 11 years.

“Don’t get me wrong, the Bondi Rescue royalties do alright but summer is kingdom come for us mate.”

Speaking with The Advocate bass player Phil Stack shocks us with the revelation that this was completely intentional.

“Originally the song was meant to be a harsh critique of the socio-economic and political issues in Dubbo like the corruption in the turf club and all the stabbings that happened in Orana Mall. But we decided we might make a bit of reliable coin each year if we made it about how good an Aussie summer is.”

With summer around the corner, Stack and his bandmates are rubbing their palms in anticipation of the annual royalties they are expecting in the comings months.

“This year is going to be a big one too. People are done with our government right now. They want to look back at a simpler time; the sweet times, the hot nights…you get me.”

Tradies Conclude That Things Must Be Fucked As Engineer Lights A Durrie On Site

TEXT:

A fresh-faced and squeaky clean graduate engineer has raised eyebrows this afternoon after sparking a PJ Gold onsite. 23 yo Dustin Willoughby was seen with eyes closed inhaling deeply on the premium cigarette before exhaling with a cathartic “Ahh”.

Site Foreman Shane Saunders was first to voice the sentiments of the mixed-trade bridge construction crew.

“Fuck me Dusty, I didn’t know you were on the burners. How long’s this been going on chief? He said, elated at the chance to rib the young Site Manager.

An agitated Mr Willoughby was unfazed by the jeers and sideways looks and explained to the Advocate that he had bigger problems.

“It’s just a durry” he said.

“Most of the boys here pull through a 20 pack before knock off. Gaz has been offering me a durry every day since we got onsite. He thinks he’s being funny or something. I’m only human mate, I love a weekend dart or 30” he laughed.

“Anyway I usually have no problem keeping the ol’ oxygen sticks for Friday through Sunday but today I’ve finally cracked”.

Mr Willoughby went on to explain the cause of his break with protocol.

“Some mouth breather has driven straight through my fucking worksite and ploughed his Hertz Hiace into the oncoming Betta milk truck. How the fuck this has happened I don’t know; there’s more signs out there than a deaf communication conference.” Mr Willoughby continued, gesturing to the road.

“Now I’ve got bits of van spread across two lanes and a bloke who doesn’t speak English on the nature strip bleeding from the head like he’s in Kill Bill 2 or something”

“It’s basically my worst nightmare, might as well enjoy a ciggy before they cart me off to jail”

As trades assistant Garry fired up the STIHL blower and attempted to clear some of the debris, Mr Willoughby was seen leaning against the site shed with his hands cupped trying to light his second cigarette from his first.

Torturous 12 Hours In Heels All Worth It For The ‘Picked A Winner’ Instagram Caption

A local woman’s cheeky pun that draws parallels between horse-racing and her current relationship has made her Melbourne Cup Day all worth it.

After a whole day in 30 degree weather, Lisa (30) has managed to keep herself together, unlike a lot of other young people binge-drinking in Flemington yesterday.

With the heels of Lisa’s feet not far off becoming open wounds, and cheap champagne bubbles bursting at the top of her brain and no sign of food in sight, time was running out to get the couple shot.

With the minutes ticking down before both went home to pass out, Lisa and her partner have decided to make the most of their matching outfits.

With her boyfriend, Mark, still looking respectable – Lisa dragged her most drunk and most single friend Shelley to a clearing of grass in the drug and alcohol-fuelled cesspool that is general admission.

“Get a photo of us!” she shrieks.

As Shelley fumbles with her iPhone, Mark and Lisa stare drunkenly into each other’s eyes, as though they are not as drunk as they feel.

Within five minutes on the sixteen photos that Shelley took of the couple she posted to social media under the caption “picked a winner”.

Sunday: Half-Pissed Local Man Haunted By Every Single Life Decision As Clock Nears 10pm

TEXT:

A recently-single man who has attempted to drink his way out of three consecutive hangovers is tonight suffering an attack of the grog horrors, as the metaphorical brake-light of Sunday bed time catches up with him.

As his mind races to unlikely hypothetical situations that could essentially ruin his life if they were to come to fruition, the 27-year-old construction manager is yet to connect the dots between his extremely large weekend and his current state of dysphoria.

“Should I have tried harder to keep her” he mutters to himself.

“Does my boss know that I actually got signed off from the TAFE course three months ago?”

“Why did I stay out that late. Hardly anyone was there when I left”

The Grog Horrors, also known as The Fear in Ireland, is described by the Oxford Dictionary as the ominous feeling of heightened personal or collective uneasiness induced by altered states of consciousness (due to drugs, alcohol or gambling) – it is most common in the days after unexpected and unbudgeted weekend blow-outs that can last right up until the bartedender’s begin cleaning the beer lines on a Sunday night.

“What did I say to that Rachel’s friend last night? She left straight after I spoke to her”

With his laptop now playing rather dark true crime videos from Youtube, it is also clear that Monday won’t feel too much better, due to how pissed he currently is.

“ahhh shit” he says.

“Maybe I should open up a gym membership”

Woman Who Spoke Up About Sexual Assault Online Comforted By Man Telling Her Men Can Be Victims Too

TEXT:

In an effort to raise awareness, local woman Leslie Tillard (26) shared her sexual assault story on social media and has since been met with an outpouring of support. One such statement of comfort came from Tillard’s friend Brian Pierce (28), who soothed Leslie’s pain by reminding her sexual assault also happens to men.

“Thought that’d make her feel better and maybe she’d even learn a thing or two. Just the kind of guy I am.”

While Pierce states he doesn’t speak to his old friend Leslie Tillard as much as he used to, when he read her description of being used by a sexual deviant, he felt beyond compelled to point out that women also do this to men in some instances.

Having never been the victim of sexual assault before, Pierce also responded by describing his experiences where he was bullied at school and had is backpack stolen in Thailand as if they were somehow related to Tillard’s traumatising recount of sexual assault.

“Sometimes, men get falsely accused of rape as well. It all kind of balances out in the end. Just saying, everyone’s pain is the same isn’t it? How about we say no to ALL assault in general.”

Unhappy with representation in politics, culture, media and journalism, Pierce started a Men’s Rights Facebook group titled Men for Men where he has conversations with like-minded individuals on a daily basis.

“We want to end ALL rape culture, not just the type that happens to women that I know and consider to be friends. Yes, that is a problem but maybe not as big a problem as thinking sexual assault just happens to women.”

“Basically, we’re about fighting ignorance and if you look in the comment section you’re probably going to see a lot of ignorance in action.”

Uni Student’s Positive Outlook On World Slowly Being Crushed By Perpetual MDMA Comedown

TEXT:

A first year uni student who spends half of each week weaving her way out of a ‘come down’ has slowly started to talk less about saving the world, and more about self-degrading feminist comedians.

As described by the American Medical Association comedown or crashing is the deterioration in mood that happens as a psychoactive drug, typically a stimulant, is either decreasing or is cleared from the blood and thus the cerebral circulation.

For young university students who enjoy talking about modern history and world politics, the comedown is a great way to give them a taste of the harshness of the real world, and end their positive outlook on adulthood.

Samantha (20) says she’s slowly becoming as pessimistic and existential as every late 20’s person she has met outside of uni.

“I hadn’t done any ecstasy before uni” she says, with a quiver in her voice.

“Now it’s all we do”

The 2nd-year environmental science student says the constant deterioration of her moods are quite badly affected by her use of stimulants an other party drugs, after the pingers have elevated her mood (a state known as a high), there follows a period of coming back down, which often has a distinct character from withdrawal in stimulants.

“There’s only so much Girls and Broad City I can watch” she says.

“In my current state I am spending a lot more time coming down on my futon then I am spending high on ecstacy while lying on the floor at a house party listening to Tame Impala”

“It’s still cheaper than going out for a drink I suppose”

Despite almost a twenty year career in media, Rove McManus has not really aged much.

“Usually short white guys age the fastest” says CSIRO CEO Larry Marshall.

Born John Henry Michael McManus in January 1974, the former late night host collaquiolly known as ‘Rove’ is an Australian triple Gold Logie award-winning comedian and media personality. He was the host of the ill-fated comedy talk show Rove LA and was also the host of the eponymous variety show Rove – which was based in Australia and much better.

Today, the federal government agency for scientific research in Australia says they are throwing as much man hours and money into this research project as possible.

“We need to find out what he’s been eating. He’s looking pretty good” says Marshall.

Rove was asked for comment but was only willing to tell our reporters that he wanted them to say hi to their mums for him.

Peking Duk Reveal Plans For 2018: Buying The Raiders And Appointing Ken Nagas As Coach

TEXT:

Following a warm reception to the release of their new single ‘Let You Down’ featuring Swedish electropop duo Icona Pop, the North Canberra electronic music duo Peking Duk have today revealed even bigger plans for 2018.

Speaking to The Betoota Advocate today, the band says their latest collaboration is a modern heartbreak melody and the first to feature vocals from one-half of the duo, Adam Hyde, but it’s nothing compared to what is happening behind the scenes.

“The [Canberra] Raiders were looking so hot at the start of this year. Blake, Papalli, the Crokers… We just lost momentum somewhere” said Reuben Styles.

“I mean, we are so fed up. It’s been the same thing for three f**king years. A strong start that falters around Origin. We decided to do something about it”

After a lengthy series of meetings with Hollywood star and South Sydney Rabbitohs owner, Russell Crowe, the musicians put together a plan to buy their beloved ACT-based NRL franchise.

“I wouldn’t say there will be a fire sale. But Sticky Ricky might be getting the flicky” laughed Hyde.

“We just need to apply the same formula to these club as we do to our music. When you are hot, you are hot”

“We build and grow on the momentum. The Milk haven’t been doing that”

Among other crucial renovations to the fostering of talent and staff, Styles says it’s time to re-engage the club’s historic ‘bad boy’ brand.

“Just think of the talent we could have trotting around out there if we didn’t give in to the wowsers who cry PC”

“Dugan, Carney, Ferguson… Maybe Monaghan deserved the brush, but there were plenty that we didn’t have to get rid off”

Styles says Russell Crowe has given the team plenty of good advice on how to best take over a club and turn it into your own beast.

“Essentially, the dream is, that whenever we are back in the country and not on tour, we’ll be down there running drills with the boys”

“Sure it might be a bit intrusive but it worked for the Bunnies. Plus we played a bit of serious footy back when we were still getting around the bowl”

If their sports business ventures are anything like their current movement, there will be plenty of more Viking claps coming out of the capital over the next couple of years. Triple J has said the Peking Duk have absolutely ‘killed’ this new single and that it is one ‘hella tuna fish’.

“Essentially we need an old school approach to this club, and the brand of footy they play. Obviously Mal, Bellamy, Laurie and Lazarus are out of the picture… And Ricky hasn’t really been on since Blakey came along” said

“What we need to do is bring back some of that real Milky footy” says Hyde.

“We have already made an under the table offer to Ken Nagas in an attempt to lure him out of the AFP. If he decides to come to the party, then it will be hard to shut the gate on us”

Brisbane Says It’d Prefer A Real Youth Crime Problem Over These Lame Fucks On Scooters

TEXT:

The people of Brisbane are cringeing today at the fact that the closest thing to street-crime that their inner-city police have had to address is a bunch of lame kids riding scooters.

This comes as several arrests were made against teenagers who were dangerously riding scooters through the city on Sunday in what appeared to be an event organised on social media – an embarrassing look for a city that likes to envision itself as a pretty tough place.

“Ahhh shit. This makes us look so lame” says one local man, Jack Cort (27).

“They could have at least been throwing bottles at the cops like they do in Sydney and England, but no, they had their iPhones out and were snapchatting them”

Another resident, Bridgette Bowler (28) says that she remembers when she was a kid and used to see kids punch on at the skate park over marijuana, now it all seems to be social media and razor scooters.

“Ahh man. So bad. Logan is way tougher”

Police say a large group of young people were riding dangerously through Fortitude Valley and the city while heading towards Kangaroo Point on Sunday afternoon.

“At times, those involved were riding the wrong way down the road and were weaving in and out of traffic,” police said.

“It appears as though the ride was organised via social media.”

Police said they were not advised of this so-called event prior to it happening, but the fact that they were met with a confrontation from these idiots also makes them look soft.

“We really wanted to bust heads to be honest. But they were like 16 and small as shit. What the fuck is going on in this city” said the police spokesperson

“Scooters are so lame”

Financial Sector Confirm “Staff Bonding” Code For “The Boss Will Be Doing Cocaine Too”

Feeling extremely delicate, tender, frazzled and flat, young Sam Wilson is not in a good state today.

After another “team bonding session” where the aspiring investment banker consumed a copious amount of alcohol and a significant amount of cocaine, Wilson told the Advocate that he wouldn’t mind something more traditional.

“Fuck me. I’m very dusty. This shit takes its toll. Can’t we go and do some fucking high ropes course or some shit,” he said.

“12 hour days, 5 days a week and then if that isn’t enough to wear you out, they give you an all-expense paid Friday night, and that definitly does enough to wipe out the whole weekend.”

“Canoeing? That would be nice. I liked when we did that at school. Couldn’t we go out to the bush and do that. It might make me feel alive again.”

Wilson, who has been in a relationship for some years now said his life has effectively become work, Friday night drinks, Saturday morning Ikea trips and Sunday chores.

“Finance people don’t actually bond with each other over real life scenarios. Just a couple runs to the atm and a communal stockbroker’s trough for us to dip the snout in”

“Doing an actual bonding trip would be great. It would mean I wouldn’t have to drag myself  through homewares shops on Saturday morning, nodding and grimacing all whilst my head feels like it’s been crushed by a vice.”

Open-Minded Drunk Chicks Encourage Shy Taxi Driver To Put His Bollywood Tunes Back On

TEXT:

A local taxi driver has today been asked to not be embarrassed about his taste in music, as a backseat of drunk Aussie girls encourage him to turn it up.

The driver, who was listening a very loud Bollywood dance song just as the girls climbed into his ride, was quick to change the stereo source from his own CD to a popular FM station.

“Noooo” says Sally.

“Put that other stuff back on”

Initially sceptical that he was being made fun of, the driver consults the passenger in his front seat about whether or not everyone is serious.

“Nah deadset turn this shit off. Put that stuff you had going back on” says Cammy.

Are you sure?” he asks.

“I usually turn it off”

Cammy insists.

“Don’t be shy, babe. This is your car! Put it back on!”

After switching back to the fast-paced Indian pop music, the girls begin waving their hair and dancing like they see people do in the occasional late night subcontinental films.

“I love this shit. Turn it up!” yells Sophie.

Their obliviously offensive attempts at singing along are lost on the driver, who smiles at the fact that people of non-Indian background are getting around his tunes.

Entrepreneur From Hometown Finally Settles On A Business Idea That Isn’t A Pyramid Scheme

TEXT:

A local girl that you haven’t really heard much about since she briefly moved to the city for the three months before returning back to your shared hometown, has started up another short-lived business, it has been confirmed.

The invitation to like her new business page on Facebook has her entire social media network wondering if this is the real deal, after several other cracks at similar multi-layered marketing-based small business franchises.

“She sent me a cold inbox to see if I was interested in selling health supplements a while back, that was pretty worrying” says another friend, Sarah, who has also been flicked an invitation.

“Turns out she wasn’t to interested in pyramid schemes. She needs to be her own boss”

After dabbling in selling her own art online, as well another short stint taking over the social media and event booking for an ex-boyfriend who took over a pub in town – the former-high school acquaintance seems to have transitioned into the beauty industry.

The mobile spray-tan, alongside several disciplines of naturotherapy are renowned across the small-towns of Australia, as short-lived business ventures for young women who were once so popular in high school that a career in modelling or acting was actually on the cards for a while.

“DM me if you want a visit. Can do lighter stuff as well” reads her first post on the business page.

Another post which appears to have been mistakenly posted from her personal facebook account, onto the wall of her new business, also outlines that she can do just the perfect spray for weddings, formals or music festivals.

Bloke Who Sells Admin Software To Medium-Sized Businesses Describes Job As ‘Hustlin’

TEXT:

To the untrained eye, 28 year old Jacob Lieschke is a sales representative for a company that sells workflow systems to medium sized corporations. Ask the man himself however, and you’ll get a different answer.

“I’m a hustler. I’m out there hustling all day erry (sic) day.” 

Following the phenomenon of young men taking a steadfast and tenacious approach to corporate culture, largely inspired by mid-naughties hip hop, we spent a day with Lieschke in his North-Betoota office.

“This is where the magic happens,” Lieschke boasts, waving his hands around of his office cubicle he shares with his co-worker Karen Grace (45). 

Continuing the tour of the two square metres of tiled carpet, Lieschke proudly shows us his mini basketball hoop, ‘Keep Calm and Hustle’ mug and framed photo of himself and Gary Vaynerchuk .

“It’s a thinktank where anything can happen.” 

It has since been confirmed that 90% of what happens involves answering calls to disgruntled clients and the occasional scripted cold call, a topic that seems to amuse Lieschke.

“Nah, not how I roll. I don’t need no tele-script, I freestyle!” Lieschke went on to demonstrate this by substituting the scripted ‘May I ask you how you’re doing?’ with “How’s your morning big champ?”

We asked Lieschke’s cubicle partner and immediate manager, Karen Grace, what she thought of his untraditional approach to B2B telephone sales.

“Jacob is a reliable employee who fulfills his required tasks to an adequate standard. I’m going back to work now.”

Our visit met and abrupt end when Lieschke had to answer an “international business call” from a Christchurch based client.

“I’m The Big Dog” Says Bloke Who Isn’t The Big Dog

TEXT:

An ambitious local man has been campaigning on-and-off for several years now with a self-given nickname that suggests he is at the top of the food chain in his social circle.

When asked where his nickname came from, Stuart Williams just shrugs and says “everyone calls me it”

“Because it’s true”

The 28-year-old online butcher sales rep has even gone as far as talking in third-person in a pathetic attempt at having his ideal moniker take off.

“Make way for the big dog” he says as he arrives back from the bar to a table of mates carrying one beer for himself.

According to Oxford Dictionary, in working class Australian culture, ‘Big Dog’ is a descriptive term for an important person. It is also a term to describe an extremely large and unnecessary vehicle, such as a Toyota Hilux SR5 Double-cab.

Stuart’s mates, who have are acutely aware of his 18-month-drought from intimate relations with the opposite sex, are quick to remind Stuart that while they aren’t certain which of their mates is the big dog, it certainly isn’t him.

“That’s such a not-big-dog thing to say” retorts the smart-alec who once aspired to play professional AFL until he briefly moved to Melbourne and realised how deep their talent pool was.

“I’m the big dog. Everyone knows it”

Surfie Confuses Beachgoers By Not Pointlessly Sprinting As Fast As He Can Into Ocean

TEXT:

A local boardrider has broken surfie protocol today by casually walking through the sand towards the ocean, without making a big deal.

Nearby beachgoers say his lack of pace confused everyone.

“I got a bit suspicious” said one lifeguard, Joe.

“Whats his go? No one just walks into the ocean, you’ve got to do a really dramatic sprint while flicking you hair heaps”

What was initially thought to be some sort of Instagram modelling exercise soon became very real, as the local bloke just continued walking into the surf until he was waist deep – at which point he began paddling on his board.

“I don’t get it. Is he going fishing or something” said a local mother, who thought she better keep her kids away from all of this.

“Why would he do that? Everyone says he’s a local boy but I don’t think so”

“For one, he’s arrived at the beach alone without the mandatory three other friends, and he’s just walked like a normal person into the water without making a big deal or yelling”

Friends of the surfie say that they don’t want to make a big deal about this because he’s been going through some stuff recently and hasn’t been himself of late.

Girlfriend’s Workmates Not As Fun As She Sold Them To Be

TEXT:

Even though she has explicitly admitted to the fact that the workmates she socialises with are not good company outside of work, it looks like Friday night is booked out by some sort of shit staff event that your girlfriend insists will be good.

A recent report by the Australian Unions has found that a majority of the surveyed partners of career-driven females admit to having to spend time around annoying old blokes that they wouldn’t consider a relationship with outside of work if it was their job.

The respondents ranged in ages and were taken from a sample of both same-sex and opposite-sex partners who really can’t be fucked going to mini-golf for a work family day this weekend.

It is believed that this recurring, nation-wide finding, is a direct result of the tolerance held by Australian females to begin with – and that if they can put up with your whingeing arse, then a chirpy Christian from accounts isn’t really that much of a slog.

The survey found that forced attendance at work drinks are usually followed by an insolent “Who’s coming to this thing?” or “Are you sure I need to be there”.

The nation’s girlfriends and wives say that the usually-drunk bloke from HR is actually really into sport, and you’d really get along with him

Bachelorette Recap: Stafford Brothers-Lookalike Gets Mercilessly Friend-Zoned

TEXT:

Well the 4th episode started off just as uncomfortably as the show can get, with Osher Gunsberg arriving to the Jock Mansion with a series of tasks that most jocks would delight in – proving their masculinity through physical exercise.

After challenge each other to a plank-off, the toxic masculinity that has so-far laid as latent as possible is put on show for all with a ‘change a tyre’ challenge, followed by a ‘put IKEA shit together’ challenge.

Next up is a cook-off, using Donna Haye-product placement packet mix cakes. The horribly cast mouth-breathers are able to briefly push their emotional issues aside as they compete for alpha status in the most unlikely of places, the kitchen! Ha ha ha.

Sophie also got forced to go on a date with one of the more personal-space-violating attention-seekers in the history of the franchise.

‘Uncle Sam’ the bloke that arrived on night one with his triplet nephews to really crank up the ‘awww factor’ – but looks like he has spent the last 20 years in a Peter-Pan hamster wheel of house music and high-quality Gold Coast MDMA – he really turns it on in a non-romantic way, and leaves audiences almost hoping for some sort of interference from the on-set security guards, as he tries to intimidate a kiss out of the Bachelorette.

Sophie, who we can only imagine has dealt with far bigger egos in Hollywood, is able to dodge his ratty Stafford Brothers fringe and forces him into a friend-zone cheek-kiss. Sucked in Sam.

As the episode wraps up, Sophie manages to ditch a contestant that hadn’t really been given much air time anyway and one that the audience was not even slightly emotionally invested in, his name was Bingham or some shit.

Local Hunk Woos Women On Tinder With Three Different Motorbike Photos

A local man has this week had to come to terms with the fact that women, for the most part, probably aren’t interesting in his motorbike or moto-racing accessories, when it comes to looking for men on dating apps.

With his mates trying to steer him towards just using a photo of him having a coffee with friends, or one of him at a social event, Kim refuses to believe that girls aren’t interested in his thoroughbred.

“Sure it was a late arrival to the 600 supersport class, but I’m like 6’3 myself, so I need a beefier ride”

“It’s fitted with a yoshi muffler and everything. It was only on about 20,000 km when I picked it up a couple months back.

Kim Daley (29) says some of these photos have even been taken professionally – and that if girls don’t like a Suzuki GSX-R1000R – then what do they like?

“What are you supposed to do in Tinder profiles? I’ve already tried photos of me at the gym, or photos of me snowboarding, my mates are telling me that I shouldn’t be wearing sunnies. What the fuck?”

“This is why I’ve ended up using a dating app. Girls are too hard to read”

Local Girl Seeks New Friendship Circle After Realising She’s Currently ‘The Miranda’

TEXT:

Part of entering adulthood is realising you might not necessarily be who you think you are. This day came early for 19 year old Lucy Marchetti, who today realised that out of her group of friends, she is definitely ‘The Miranda.’

“This is just typical! Just because I care about my career and tell it how it is I’m automatically the Miranda! Fuck that, I’m the Carrie!”

Marchetti’s protests were met with fierce responses from her childhood friends including BFF Sophie Turner who responded firmly with “No. I’m the Carrie.”

It was at around this point that Marchetti decided she would rather abandon her longstanding, tight-knit clique than resign herself to a lifetime of apparent questionable taste in both men and fashion.

“Like I dated a guy with one ball but that’s just coincidence.”

Our researchers confirmed Marchetti has in fact dated two men with one testicle, one of whom was named Steve.

“Doesn’t matter,” Marchetti stated reassuringly. “I’ll find a new group where I can be a Carrie or a Charlotte. Hell, I’ll even slut it up and be a Samantha as long as I don’t have to be a fucking Miranda.”

When asked for a comment, Marchetti’s childhood friend Kathleen Stephens (‘The Samantha’) incredulously stated that she would be welcome back in the group, potentially as a ‘Harry’ or a ‘Stanford.’

ABS Warns Yes Votes Don’t Count Unless They’re Instagramed With Caption And Emojis

TEXT:

Sending off your same-sex marriage survey response without instagraming yourself filling it in, or placing the envelope into the post box may render the vote ineligible, the Australian Bureau of Statistics has confirmed.

As Australia takes part in a voluntary postal survey on the issue of same-sex marriage. The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) who are hosting the survey alongside the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC), say they are concerned some Australians are not getting fully involved in the democratic process

While, the ABS says some people will be entitled to a paperless option in the survey. Particularly, people who are going overseas, people with disability and people who live in remote communities and Indigenous town camps.

However, for the inner-city post codes, the Bureau of Statistics say that postal survey responses will be accepted but must be accompanied with an Instagram post or story, just to identify the fact that they are being sent of by the most important demographic in the country and therefore twice as important as regular votes.

“What we need our inner-city, university-educated youth to do is let us know they are voting via both the post and social media” says Minister for Small Business Michael McCormack.

“Preferably with the caption ‘yaasss’ or ‘so much yes!’ – that way it’s easier for us to know how important your vote is”

“Not looking at it might get me through Sunday, but I was always going to have to confront the repercussions of my behaviour”

After an unplanned Friday night blow-out, Casey arrived at a long-scheduled birthday party on Saturday afternoon with a horrific hangover.

“I needed to spend money freely to tackle that hangover. Cocktails, cheese. That kind of shit helps me get back on the wagon” she says.

“Throwing caution to the wind and feeling like I have control over my life financially takes away a lot of the pain from the night before. Unfortunately I ended up doing that on Sunday night as well”

Casey doesn’t often crank it up for three nights in a row but 9 months after ended a relatively long-term complicated relationship, she justified the big weekend as a chance for her to treat herself.

Osher Escorted Off Set Of Bachelor After Literally Cutting The Tension With A Knife

TEXT:

Uh OH! Matty has dumped Australia’s favourite #BACHELORAU contestant Tara, only to be met with a flood of angry tweets from people who are actually emotionally invested in which Gold Coast-based Instagram model this robot decides to spend the next 6 months with,

This means there’s two left. Elise and Laura. Who’s it gonna be? huh?

Laura Byrne has been the favourite with the bookies and Newspoll for a while, and her nearly authentic chemistry with Matty would seem as though they’ve got it right – so do the odds ($1.45) tipping her to win.

However, former Hockeyroos star Elise has screamed down from $11 to $3, and her competitive streak shines through.

What we as a brain-dead, gullible, mercilessly bored nation are witnessing is a rare television event. A dating show so close, so emotional, so enthralling that you could literally cut the tension with a knife.

It’s a term that’s not thrown around that often, only during the finaldash of any major reality program, and one that The Bachelor Host Osher Gunsberg has landed himself in trouble for, after attempting to prove how tense things were by waving a knife around on set.

“It was a bit irresponsible in hindsight” says Osher.

“I just wanted everyone back home to see how thick the tension is. But yeah, a couple of the girls in costuming starting crying. Wasn’t a good look. Apologies everyone”

Osher says after being chicken-winged by security, he’s ready to take tonight’s final episode a little more seriously.

“Sometimes I forget we just aren’t on Channel V anymore partying with Fred Durst and Jamiroquai. Gotta put my serious dating show host back on”

Report: Walking Into Someone’s Photo Is Fine As Long As You Half-Heartedly Duck

TEXT:

A recent report by the Australian Institute For Tourism Photography has found that the obviously unavoidable occurrence of walking in between a photographer and their subject is 100% okay, as long as you acknowledge what you are doing by half-heartedly ducking.

Accidentally walking into photos has been an issue plaguing tourists and residents of tourist areas for many years, however the ‘half-hearted duck has been today identified as a perfectly fine alternative.

Lead researcher, Dr Darius Bowen says in 2017, this kind of incident is way less of a deal because everyone has digital cameras and can just delete the photo and have another crack.

“Back in the day people may have got a bit stroppy, mainly because there was a finite amount of film that could be used”

“But nowadays its all good. Unless we are dealing with a once in 100 year eclipse or something, in that case you actually need to duck so low that you are out of shot”

The report found that other alternatives to the old half-hearted duck include walking really slowly into the frame while looking at the photographer in the eyes and waiting to be told not to – or asking if they are fine to have you walk through, and then hesitantly doing it regardless of their answer.

“My old photo was the same as my Facebook one,” he said, “and it was a bit lo-res, to be honest. But I got a new haircut and a $10-off voucher for a photo shoot down the Plaza, so I thought I’d give myself a bit of an fresh look on LinkedIn. Next minute, the endorsements are flooding in.”

“He just looks like a bloke you can trust to give you a good rate on your loan,” explains Betoota hotelier Chris Parker, who now has Frankham managing his money with the bank. “Like he knows his stuff, but isn’t a prick about it.”

Girlfriend Glides Over Wildly Inconsistent Timeline And Blatant Plot Holes In Last Night’s Dream

TEXT:

A study conducted by the Australian Opposite-Sex Relationship Lobby has found that a local Betoota man by the name of Roddy has spent most a large portion of the last few years listening to his girlfriend delicately describe every single thing that happened in her dream, despite the fact that it wasn’t even a good dream by the sounds of it.

This is a notable occurrence in many Australian relationships, with Roddy’s specific case study resonating with thousands of respondents:

After waking up together, Jenna tells Roddy that she had a strange, but also pretty cool succession of images, ideas, emotions, and sensations that occurred involuntarily in her mind during a specific stage of last night’s sleep – it is not exactly known at what point she had this dream – but it feels like it happened literally before she woke up.

“So we were having a girls weekend at the old beach house that Christina’s family use to own and then there was this group of other girls…” begins Jenna, before Roddy impatiently interrupts to see where this is going before she insists it’s good.

After clarifying that there was no sex in this specific dream, Jenna specifies that the content and purpose of her recent dreams are not fully understood, though they have been a topic of scientific speculation, as well as a subject of philosophical and religious interest, throughout her day-to-day life.

“… and then like, I realise, like in the dream that I didn’t even know who that girl was. Like she wasn’t one of my friends. And like we ended up being chased by these guys with guns, but she left her group and hid with us”

“Like I think she was with the other group, but joined ours. Weird”

Roddy agrees that this story is weird and asks Jenna what she has on today in an attempt to stop talking about things that don’t make sense.

WTF? Some People Actually Don’t Know How To Swim, Like Fully Grown Adults

TEXT:

Aside from migrants and bushies who originate from landlocked, drought stricken terrains – there is actually a population of Australians who don’t know how to swim. Like people that grew up around relatively large bodies of water who just never learnt.

Recent findings by the YMCA show that roughly 25% of Australians over the age of 15 are not confident in entering water without a boat to hold onto – or a pool ladder.

While this statistic is often presented as an class issue – research shows it’s not necessarily about being able to afford swimming lessons, with the housing commission-based Bra Boys surfing gang used as a case study into how people can learn these kinds of skills without blowing money on some old girl covered in zinc handing out foam paddle boards.

“It’s weird AF” tweeted ex-QLD Premier Campbell Newman.

“You’d think that’s something we would have tackled before we tried to introduce Korean language as a mandatory subject in our public school system”.

Champion Australian surfer Mick Fanning says as someone who grew up in the back end of the Western Suburbs of Sydney, even he was competent enough of a swimmer to become a pro-watersportsman.

“We’d hold classes down at Western Sydney Wet’n’Wild every Sunday”

“That’s where I learnt to surf as well – in the wave pool”

Abbott Reveals He Slept Through 2015 Libspill After A Couple Bottles Of Red

TEXT:

Far-right members of the Coalition have today criticised former Prime Minister Tony Abbott for missing a series of pivotal moments during his leadership because he was drunk and passed out on a couch.

After years of rumours, Mr Abbott has finally admitted he was asleep after a long night of drinking when his successor Malcolm Turnbull massacred him in the second libspill in his time as Prime Minister.

Mr Turnbull, who was Communications Minister at the time and had been given the wildly unpopular job of slashing the ABC and installing a very low quality NBN across the country, said he had been aware of Mr Abbott’s booze-induced slumber and that his fellow religious colleagues had “tried to rouse him to get him to stop me but were unable to move him”.

“It was a pretty important for his career, too … I’m sure he was disappointed but you’ve got to move on with these things,” Mr Turnbull told Melbourne radio station 3AW on Friday.

“Come to think of it, he might have been drunk his whole time in the job – not just on the power, but whatever type of wine that upper middle class North Shore sexists drink”

This follows the news that Abbott has admitted to drinking too much and sleeping through several votes in federal parliament in 2009. During an interview with Annabel Crabb in an upcoming episode of the ABC series The House, Abbott says he “lay down and next thing I knew it was morning”

However, close Abbott allies in the Coalition have suggested that the former Prime Minister could use this whole drinking thing to explain and excuse some of his more notable gaffes.

“Just say you were drunk when you told those Aussie troops that “shit happens” after their mates was killed at war” says Tasmanian Senator Eric Abetz.

“Or when you winked when that lady said she was working on a sex line because you cut her pension” said Dutton.

“Or when you munged into a raw onion, twice on live television” said another no-name backbencher.

“Or when you tried to knight that 90-year-old British bloke instead of Richie Benaud six months before he died”

Big Mouth Billy Bass Still Good For A Laugh

TEXT:

A recent report by the AHBA (Australian Home Bars Association) has found that the popular late nineties novelty gift ‘Big Mouth Billy Bass’ is still fucking funny, even if you’ve seen it before.

Big Mouth Billy Bass is an animatronic singing prop, representing a largemouth bass, invented on December 16, 1998, sold on January 1, 1999, and popular in the early 2000s. The fish is made of latex rubber with a plastic mechanical skeleton inside of it; at first glance, it appears to be a mounted game fish.  The device turns its head towards a person, facing them, and then wiggles its tail on its trophy plaque and sings kitschy cover songs, such as “Don’t Worry, Be Happy” by Bobby McFerrin and “Take Me To The River”.

“What we’ve found is that the censor-operated singing fish is still a pissa” said lead researcher, Kerry Singleton.

“We would advise all people who have pool rooms or home bars with a bit of funny merch on the walls to consider buying a Big Mouth Billy Bass”

“It’s still so fucking funny”

The report found that while the fish can still sit on the wall as a simple bit of decoration, the batteries seem to last forever, and it’s worth turning it on when your pop comes around because he probably hasn’t seen it yet.

Aside from an online community of ‘free speech’ activists, it appears that only the controversial Australian Catholic Church and the nation’s far-right politicians feel the need publicly oppose marriage equality in the lead up to the postal vote – as pubs, cafes, restaurants and progressive religious leaders urge Australians to vote love.

One local retailer, by the name of Tony (bags) has also used his network of loyal customers to remind Australians to enrol for the postal vote, and support marriage equality.

As one of the most prominent cocaine and amphetamines dealers in the greater Betoota region, Tony (bags) says his business is a big supporter of diversity and equality amongst Australians.

“Gays make up some of my most loyal customers”

“I owe it to them to show full support for marriage equality”

Aaron Gocs To Reprise Heath Ledger’s Most Iconic Character In ‘Candy’ Remake

TEXT:

Australian comedian turned serious actor, Aaron Gocs will lead an extraordinary ensemble cast for Channel 10’s contemporary re-imagining of Australian literary and film classic, Candy.

Gocs, who came to fame in 2015 through the combination of a viral comedy career and several sold-out stand up tours, has today confirmed in an interview with The Age that he will playing the iconic role of ‘Dan’ – made famous by the late Oscar-winning Perth actor Heath Ledger in 2006.

The mini-series, which joins a long list of classic Australian film remakes, including Romper Stomper, Chopper and Wake In Fright – is yet another testament to the renaissance of Australian film – which has seen hundreds of iconic roles butchered by people who will never compete with Crowe, Ledger or Bana.

Director, Noah Deers, says he can’t wait to see an entirely new generation give him credit for remaking an already perfectly fine Australian film.

“We had the idea. It’s worked before, why not do it again?”

“We just needed someone who’s popular with the kids. That’s where Gocsy comes in”‘

Abbie Cornish is set to return as the beautiful Candy, who gravitates to Gocs’ character’s bohemian lifestyle and his love of heroin. Hooked as much on one another as they are on the drug, their relationship alternates between states of oblivion, self-destruction, and despair. David Wenham is to play the role of academic drug dealer, Casper – while House Husbands’ Gary Sweet will play the role of Candy’s dad.

Gocs says he’s “really exciting to test his range” after a whirlwind 18 months dominating the Australian comedy scene.

“I like to view myself as an artist, so I guess I’m up to the job”

“These producers just hit me up for some guaranteed viewers – I don’t think they back themselves at all. In fact, I think my entire fan base are going to be quite confused by the whole thing”

“What the fuck is going on?

Dick Smith To Spend $1M Advertising The Stuff Your Pop Says When He’s Had A Few

Australian pre-internet entrepreneur Dick Smith has this week revealed that his definitely still rich enough to not be ignored.

The multiple home-owning North Shore blueblood says that as he grows older, he is finding it harder to find ways to deal with his misplaced nostalgia.

“I blame immigrants” he says.

“Roseville used to look much different in the 50s. Now there’s at least two Asian families on every five acre block”

The former electronics magnate, shameless self-promoter and creator of the gross vegemite rip-off Ozemite – is launching a $1m advertising blitz that says immigration and population growth are primarily to blame for the country’s woes – rather than structural issues of inequality, low wages or poor housing policy created by fair-skinned, wealth-hoarding baby-boomers like himself.

The entire nation smiled and nodded as the man they so badly want to remember as a nice bloke began teeing off on immigrants as though they are the reason our nation’s resources and state assets are being sold overseas.

“It really reminds me of some of the things pop says when he’s having a senior moment” said one TV viewer.

“It’s just that Dick Smith is paying for these comments to be broadcast across Australia”

“I’m just glad with my grandpa you can fill his face with carrot cake and he’ll shut up.”

“Dick is like most rich white men of that age, they are too rich to accept they might be wrong”

This comes months after the corned-beef enthusiast backed Pauline Hanson’s One Nation as the only political party doing anything about the rates of foreigners coming into Australia and not buying his low-quality food products.

“It All Makes Sense” Says Traumatised Tamworth Merino

TEXT:

A traumatized Tamworth merino whether has finally been able to reconcile with years of mistreatment at the hands of a certain agricultural worker in the region.

The three-year-old is ruminant mammal has spent his life living between the Liverpool Plains and Walcha but predominantly in the Tamworth area.

He says the recent news about sheep shagging in the New England electorate has really answered a lot of questions for him, and several of his friends.

“It’s just. I could never understand” says the victim, John* (name changed).

“I just could never understand [the attacker’s] interest in me”

“But now, after the news. It all makes sense”

“He was a Kiwi hiding in plain sight”

After today’s news, prominent sheep activists have called for a Royal Commission into Agricultural Responses to Sheep Abuse At The Hands Of New Zealanders – citing that the issue is something that has literally gone straight to the top.

These calls comes after photos have emerged of the former Tamworth accountant drinking long necks of New Zealand lager in a Far-South Brisbane bikie pub.

Witnesses say Barnaby was seen ordering a “bux of flaggins for his bros” before saying saying “churr” and asking the bartender how the Crusaders were looking this year.

Mate Who’s Got Responsibilities Tomorrow Urged To Not Think About Them Right Now

TEXT:

A local regular at the Lord Kidman hotel has already insinuated that he will be pulling up stumps soon, as he apparently has to do stuff tomorrow with people who aren’t currently at the pub with him.

The 29-year-old by the name Dan, mentioned something to do with IKEA, or maybe his in-laws, before being heavily questioned over what could be more important than a few jars with the lads.

“You are kidding me?” says one regular, Kenno.

“IKEA, you need to be 100% for IKEA?”

“You’ve gone soft”

Another regular by the name of Mickey said he would have accepted ‘already in the doghouse’ or ‘funeral’ but the vague suggestion that Dan has ‘shit to do’ is just flat out insulting.

“Mate.” he says.

“What the fuck”

“The footy is on in like three hours. What are you doing?”

Dan gives as sincere of an apology as he can muster.

“Mate, I left work an hour early to catch you lot, don’t fucking get into about this shit”

“I’ve got shit to do”

Kenno responds quite emotionally.

“Yeah so do I but you don’t see me making that everyone elses problem”

“Just stay for a couple”

Dan folds and stays for a couple more schooners.

Australian Drug Dealers To Retire Ounce Measurement In Transition To Metric System

TEXT:

After 47-years in the making, the metrication of Australia has been officially completed today, as Australian drug dealers finally make the transition from the Imperial system.

As of Melbourne cup this year, Australian drug dealers will no longer use measurements such as ounce, half ounce, quarter ounce to unitise marijuana, cocaine and amphetamines.

Before 1970, Australia mostly used the imperial system for measurement, which the Australian colonies had inherited from the United Kingdom. Between 1970 and 1988, imperial units were withdrawn from general legal use and replaced with SI metric units, facilitated through legislation and government agencies.

However, due to an unwillingness to cooperate with government agencies, the Australia’s drug cooks, traffickers and dealers make up the last industry that adheres to imperial measurements.

Local drug dealer, Beaudeane Sullivan (35) says it’s been a long time coming, and that he is happy to finally see a transition.

“Most of our industry are staunch republicans” he says.

“We do not see the benefit in having the Queen of England as a head of state, and therefore resent any throwbacks of Imperialism”

However, Beaudeane says the biggest challenge for his industry has been communicating to customers that the ounce will now be known as a “two eight three five” (28.35g).

“It’s been tricky. We can’t advertise these things, so most of the information has been shared face-to-face in the front of a WRX”

SI units are now the sole legal units of measurement in Australia. Australia’s largely successful transition to the metric system contrasts with the ongoing opposition to metrication in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom.

Bus Driver Waiting Until Passenger Is Almost Seated Before He Steps On It

TEXT:

Local bus driver, Morgan Turinui (45) is waiting until his most recent passenger is no longer holding onto anything before he puts the pedal to the metal, it has been confirmed.

As is protocol in suburban public transport, bus drivers are required to begin driving before passengers are able to place their entire body weight into a seat.

Local commuter, Glenn, says he knows being thrown against another random commuter is part and parcel with public transport, but he still finds it frustrating.

“I just wish he could do it while I’m still walking down the aisle” says Glenn.

“Not when my entire body is preparing to sit down next to someone I don’t know”.

“It’s very tiring having to apologise and then sit in complete silence for the whole trip”

However, Mr Turinui says he has a job to do, and he won’t steer from the rulebook.

“I have strict instructions to hit the pedal and put passengers off balance while also pretending I don’t know what is happening behind me” he says.

“That’s how it how it has always been” he says.

The Betoota City Council have refuted claims that their bus drivers only appear to be interested in picking up the pace and adhering to their timetables when passengers are looking vulnerable.

Health-Conscious Bloke Decides Against First Straw In The Dispenser At Maccas

A health fanatic from Betoota’s Northside has today proven just how much he cares about what goes into his body, by not using the first straw currently sitting in the straw dispenser at McDonalds.

“You never know what’s on it” the health concious local by the name of Declan says to The Betoota Advocate.

“I’m just always conscious of how many people come into places like this one” he says while rolling a cigarette.

“The exposed part of the straw machine… It’s like a trolley handle or a coin”

“That straw could have been touched by anyone. I always throw the first one out anyway and use a straw from further up”

Footy Show Waxes Someone Again

TEXT:

A recent report by the ACMA has today found that AFL and NRL panel shows are almost solely dependent on the same gag.

After studying hundreds of hours of both Channel 9, 7 and FoxSports football variety shows, researchers have found that nothing is funnier than watching a blokey ex-player getting his chest waxed.

In partnership with Monash University, the Australian Communications and Media Authority believe that the entire format of footy panel shows would not exist if it weren’t for the nervousness of ex-footballers lying on a table at a beautician, and their subsequent response to the painful procedure.

“[laughter] It’s so so good,” said Macquarie Unversity Professor, Les Boyd.

“Even after seeing 1300 different blokes getting waxed, I still can’t get enough”

“No wonder it does so well”

Speaking to the media today, AFL Footy Show regular Sam Newman defended the hilarious joke format.

“There’s only so many ply-wood boards that we can make crowd members throw a ball through”

“The body waxing is a big part of our industry”

Former NRL Footy Show host, Paul Vautin, says the same.

“We can’t do arm wrestling anymore after Wendell snapped Rossy’s femur in half”

“Body waxing is the perfect, harmless little skit. Remember when my nipples bled!?”

“Like the other day for example, Channel 9 were making us interview Hollywood heart-throb Zac Efron, and we really had no other way to pull off the interview without making him wax Beau Ryan’s chest.”

The report has also found the remaining 11% of football panel show content is made up of in-depth commentary about the modern game – as well as hilarious skits that feature all-time footballing greats eating really hot chillis and talking about their missos.

1st-Year Uni Student Begins Adulthood By Finally Deciding On Favourite Type Of Coffee

A local 18-year-old has today decided that she has had enough different types of coffee to confidently say she has a favourite.

While taking a break from the lectures at University, Rachel Cottee takes a sip from the freshly made caffeine beverage and decides that this might be her one.

After a year of metropolitan living, the aspiring Marine Biologist has finally decided that she is a ‘chai latte’ type – after boldly steering away from the cappucino several months ago.

Growing up in the city’s fringe, Rachel admits the only coffee she ever saw was whatever had the most chocolate sprinkles on it, while at lunch with mum at the local Coffee Club, even her dad never strayed too far away from the Nespresso Instant.

But now, with independence, freedom and the early stages of a tertiary education, she has realised she needs to pick one.

“I really liked the Mocca. Do you know that one? It’s like half chocolate. But I realised that most people don’t usually get that much real milk in their coffee”

“Like known of the other girls from uni do”

“I’ve ordered the chai latte a few times now. That’s what I drink”

With another 80 years of taxpaying and complicated life decisions ahead of her, Rachel says she can’t see many other hurdles that she can’t handle coming her way.

Young Person Suffering From Gayness Still Not As Sick As Daily Telegraph Readers

TEXT:

A Betoota teenager who enjoys Lady Gaga and has a trophy cabinet full of gold medals for jazz and tap is actually in far greater health than anyone who gets their news from the Daily Telegraph, it has been confirmed.

These revelations come from a recent report put forward by the Betoota’s Integrated Gays, Friends, Undecided, Lesbians And Liasons Alliance (BIGFULLA).

The studies have shown that while young gay people may suffer from certain elements of their orientation, such as being bullied by kids who’s parents read the Daily Telegraph, most are actually living quite healthy lives.

“I think the kids are going to be alright. So long as they don’t have one of the biggest newspapers in the country suggesting they are suffering an illness because they have a hint of lavender” said spokesperson, Aunty Brenda.

“In fact, they are in much greater health than most Daily Telegraph readers”

“…Mainly because they don’t spend their lives in fear of young men of dark complexion. They also aren’t made to think they are weak for caring about the environment”

This news has shocked the depressed and overweight alcoholics in the infographic department of NewsLimited, who were yesterday criticised for their coverage of the apparent “health crisis” facing young Australians. The report was based on a NSW government survey covering drug use and eating habits amongst young people – which also suggested that same-sex attraction is unhealthy.

Local gay teenager, Jai, says he doesn’t feel as though he’s unwell, but he’s not sure anymore after some bloodshot divorcee sitting in cubicle office on Holt street said his same-sex attraction was a result of a ‘health crisis’.

“I guess me being gay takes away from the fact that NSW has just put forward the most dismal State Of Origin team in recent memory”

“In fact, I’m a proud gay Queenslander who worries about coral bleaching. I’m their worst nightmare”

Jai’s comments have resulted in several phone calls from Johnathan Thurston, Cameron Smith, Wally Lewis and Darren Lockyer who have also been horribly treated by the Daily Telegraph over the years.

Millennial Tags Boyfriend Located At Other End Of Couch In Relatively Funny Meme

TEXT:

A local member of Generation-Y has today lived out exactly what her parents fear most, by communicating with her long-term boyfriend only via mobile, despite being in the same room as him.

After seeing a funny meme in her Facebook newsfeed, local coffee enthusiast Jenna Bailey (23) felt she could not continue scrolling without sharing the same joke with her boyfriend Tristian.

Despite both finding the online content worthy of a ‘like’ neither of them showed any form of facial expression that would warrant an emotional response.

Generation Y (also known as Millennials) are the demographic cohort following Generation X. There are no precise dates for when this cohort starts or ends. Demographers and researchers typically use the early 1980s as starting birth years and the mid-1990s to early 2000s as ending birth years.

This particular generation has not once experienced the frustrations that arise when trying to learn how to use a form of technology that has long surpassed their level of digital literacy, and therefore are able to communicate in ways that make older people angry and confused.

Jenna’s mother, who in two years has been unable to make a Facetime phone call without partially covering the front-facing camera with her index finger, says these kids are all doomed.

“How are they going to be able to fix the environment if they carry on like that”

“Communicating through those superior communication devices. It just doesn’t make sense”

“No wonder none of them can afford to buy homes or get health insurance they way we did”

Local Bloke Instagrams Photo Of Himself Hiking On First Weekend Off The Gear In 2 Years

TEXT:

A local bloke has today suggested that he too has the motivation and fitness to do normal things on weekends, with an out-of-character social media post of him hiking at a nearby lookout.

After two years of heavy drinking and recreational drug use, the local online sales rep has alluded to the fact that he often goes hiking and that he is actually quite healthier than you think.

However, by captioning the photo upload with #FreshSundays, 29-year-old Mick Courtney has given himself away – by proving that after a three hour sunrise hike, the only word that came to his mind was ‘fresh’.

This doesn’t take away from the fact that Mick’s usual weekend activities, which usually involve large amounts of MDMA and cocaine use and a limited amounts of food and water, are nothing but a distant memory now – as he poses nonchalantly atop of an iconic lookout in a nearby National Park.

Close friend and usual bender associate, Eddie, says Mick isn’t fooling anyone with this thinly-veiled attempt at presenting himself as someone who has the slightest amount of control over his life.

“Mate, one weekend wearing hiking boots isn’t going to make up for the fact that he’s spent the last 104 weekends face-down on the top of a washing machine in his hideous sharehouse” says Eddie.

“His Tuesday mornings are usually less fresh than the average person’s Saturday – he’s dilussional if he thinks most people believe this shit”

“I know for a fact that he hated every minute of that walk, and I don’t know who was taking the photo but I imagine it was a new crush”

“Either that, or he’s finally pulling his finger out and trying to impress a girl with an instagram photo”

But despite Eddie’s skepticism, Mick says that he’s been doing this for a while.

“It’s a great spot. I love getting up here and checking out the amazing views” he says.

“I’m thinking of running a marathon next year”

Report: Mid-Arvo Piss Ups On Gorgeous Queenslander-Style Verandas Are So Good

Sinking piss on a gorgeous Queenslander-style-stilted-timber-veranda is one Australia’s most valuable offerings when it comes to quality of life – a global survey examining 450 cities has found.

The River City Capital and several other river settlement in Northern New South Wales and further north in Queensland have been compared with Basel, Switzerland in Mercer’s 19th annual Quality of Living survey, which provides rankings for 231 of the 450 cities.

“What we have found is that both religious extremism and lone wolf spree-killings are less likely to be perpetrated by people who have been lucky enough to experience a heavy session on a timber veranda in the mid arvo sun while some Powderfinger is blaring in the background” said the NYC-based lead researcher, Professor Horan.

“It’s just so good. I hadn’t experienced it until I got to Queensland to do this survey. Seriously good vibes” he wrote in the report.

“Forget the beaches, forget the Outback. Just go full Jacaranda and let the air into a few cold BB tins”

“Deadset”

The annual survey, which is run by Mercer to help companies “compensate employees fairly when placing them on international assignments” considered factors including a city’s political stability, crime levels, economic environment, whether or not a good band like Powderfinger has come from their there, personal and cultural freedom, health services, standard of education, pub culture transportation, housing and environment and how good the local rugby league side is.

On the other end of the spectrum, developing, unsafe and war-torn cities were among the worse places for quality of living. Baghdad ranked in last place, with Melbourne in Victoria, Damascus in Syria and Port au Prince in Haiti also among the bottom 10.

ATO Worried There Won’t Be Much For Their Sons To Steal If Aussies Keep Avoiding Tax

TEXT:

Administrators of the Australian Taxation Office have today revealed that they are concerned Australians might be claiming too many deductions in their tax returns, and in turn minimising how much their executive’s sons will able to steal from us.

While admitting that the $165 million Plutus tax scandal has “tarnished” the reputation of Australian Taxation Office, the ATO was also keen to point out that Australian workers are overly keen in claiming a $150 tax deduction for clothing expenses.

“Essentially, if Aussies keep trying to claim random deductions, then there won’t be much left in the kitty for our sons to steal” said one spokesman, Theo Vingprick.

In March this year, it was confirmed that the Tax Office has been actually fucking robbing us.

Michael Cranston, who has worked for the tax office for over three decades, will be charged with abusing his position as a public official relating to the alleged fraud, although it is his son Adam that is in a lot more fucking shit.

The Bondi fuckboy was arrested at his flat in the affluent beach suburb of Bondi during raids yesterday and has been charged with conspiracy to defraud the Commonwealth – alongside his sister, the Cranston children are one of ten to be arrested in the raids.

In a statement released by the ATO today, it was revealed that if Australians, for any reason, feel their tax dollars aren’t safe in the hands of silver-spoonfed white cunts from the Eastern suburbs, then they are well in their right to not pay tax at all.

“We completely understand if you don’t trust us”

“But please stop it with the random work expenses. It’s just not honest”

Girlfriend Takes An Hour To Explain Fairly Common Social Scenario That Happened With The Girls

A local woman has spent the best part of an hour explaining to her boyfriend the intricate, and apparently fragile, social nuances involved when her girlfriends are faced with a pretty common social occurrence.

Shelly Hawke (30) insists her boyfriend Brad doesn’t understand how big of a deal it was that Katie and Annabel were forced to pay the same amount as the rest of the group – even though they came late to the restaurant and only drank out of four of the five bottles that were ordered.

“Like, I get it… I’m glad I didn’t have to pay more either, but like – I can see where they were coming from”

As the debrief from last night reaches a relatively nonplussing climax at the 43 minute mark, Brad realises that his girlfriend’s entire interpretation of this scenario came from solely facial expressions and absolutely zero dialogue.

“Wait, did Katie or Bel specifically say they were upset about it?” asks Brad.

“No, but, like, I could tell”

Disney On Ice: Cinderella And Snow White Arrested On Drug Charges

The latest ‘Disney on Ice’ tour has hit a major speed bump today after two of its stars were arrested for possession of illicit substances.

Both Cinderella and Snow White were taken into custody after significant amounts of methamphetamines were found in their possession.

A senior constable from the Queensland Police Force laughed before confirming that it “really is Disney on ice” – while making a reference to the fact that the iconic Princesses had been doing a little bit of a twirl and burn.

“I would love to make a post on our Facebook about Disney on Ice being legal, but Disney on Ice on ice being illegal, but I reckon those millennials in the social media team will shut it down,” he said.

The touring company issued a short statement on the charges, stating that they can’t believe a country with such a big ice problem like Australia didn’t understand what they meant when they said the performers will literally be on ice.

2016 Census Results Suggests Everyone Needs To Calm The Fuck Down About Islam

TEXT:

Former PM Tony Abbott has today joined other conservative minor party politicians in accusing the Australian Bureau of Statistics of driving a ‘leftie’ bias agenda – after a record number of people who claim “no religion” has overtaken Catholics in the 2016 Census Results.

The most recent results show that “no religion” rose from 22.6 per cent to 29.6 per cent — nearly double the 16 per cent in 2001. These new numbers clash with the modern conservatives interpretation of Australia, especially the results that suggest those identifying as Catholic dropped from 25.3 per cent to 22.6 per cent.

“The ABS is just forcing their leftie agenda down everyones throats” said Australian Conservatives leader Cory Bernardi.

“They are trying to say that our Christian nation is increasingly not-Christian. What’s next? These lefties will want to ban Christmas”

“Or ban the cane from schools”

Islam (2.6 per cent) and Buddhism (2.4 per cent) were the next most common religions reported, proving that modern Australian political populism may be a little bit off when it comes to their fear-mongering warnings about the rise of Islam.

“Islam has pretty much grown with the population” says one statistician.

“I don’t think we have seen much of a growth since last census. Put it this way, there are more people in this country that identify as transgender than there are that identify as Muslim”

“I think everyone needs to calm the fuck down. Islams represents a very small minority when it comes to belief systems”

Christian orders who can see the writing on the wall when it comes to the decline of tax-free collection plates, also made headlines last year to encourage people to list themselves as ‘Christian’ instead of Atheist to avoid Islam being listed as our number one religion.

Unfortunately there fear campaign was also proven fals as ‘No Religion’ is now listed as Australia’s most popular religion. Which technically means we are a No Religion nation.

Dad Forced To Take 18 Different Departure Gate Photos Before Kiss Goodbye

Neo-Nazi Wants Australia To Go Back To How It Was When His Pop Was At War With Nazis

TEXT:

Local neo-nazi skinhead Bryce Cantrell (19) says he is sick of the attitudes held by people who don’t seem to care about Australia’s proud history.

Bryce says he became a staunch anti-multiculturalist at the age of 15, which coincidentally was around the same time his parents divorced, leaving him without a father figure to guide him through some of the most pivotal life experiences a young man can experience in young adulthood.

“Multiculturalism doesn’t work” he says.

“We need to go back to how it was when Australia was a proud of who we were”

Bryce says his misplaced nostalgia of a peaceful and inclusive Australian society is roughly set around the time his late grandfather was his age, between 1935-1945.

“People didn’t protest things like Australia Day back then…”

“…Mainly because Australia Day didn’t exist then, but if it had, they definitely wouldn’t have had a problem with us waving the Aussie flag and wearing it as a cape while we got flogged on the beach”

Bryce says after reading Mein Kampf, the political manifesto of a war criminal that his grandfather was conscripted and sent to Europe to help fight, he has a much different way of thinking about his neighbours.

“They don’t know anything about our culture or history. The Indian family next door don’t know what it’s like to have a grandfather fight in WWII”

“Or the Singaporeans down the street? They don’t know what it’s like to lose family members during the fall of Singapore”

Local Girl Posts Smoking Hot Photo Of Self As Birthday Tribute To Less Photogenic Friend

TEXT:

Local girl, Shannon Varbetti (27) has today taken to social media to pay tribute to ‘one of her best friends and rock for so many years’ – a close friend named Clare, who’s birthday is today.

In a surprising move, the photo tribute, which has racked up close to 120 likes on social media this morning – actually isn’t a very good shot of the friend being celebrated.

The four-line caption, which gives a deeply emotional summary of their close friendship to date, is far more flattering to the birthday girl than the actual photo of her.

Witnesses say they can’t understand why Shannon would choose that photo, aside from the fact that she’s looks pretty bloody good in it.

Developments have since arisen in the story which suggest Shannon has only recently stopped giving Clare the silent treatment over her selfish and psychopathic decision to text an ex-boyfriend of Ms Varbetti.

This has lead analysts to argue that the unflattering photo may be intentional.

“What. No wayy” says Shannon to her inquisitive new boyfriend, who says even he noticed.

“Oh my God. This is a good photo of both of us. What are you talking about”

Shannon’s alleged passive aggressive social media use appears lost on Clare, who was seen posting ” <3 ” underneath the photo.

But with the rapid decline in smoking and rise in cigarette prices, Roberts options have dwindled, leaving those who still smoke wanting to drag him out the door by his collar and kick him down the stairs.

“he’s deadset fucking taking the piss” said his old school mate JP.

“he doesn’t even ask anymore. he just takes them” before another victim, Pete Champion chimed in “unless you’ve got rollies. he asks you to roll them for him. it’s killing me”.

Sydney Spends $10 Million On Lighting To Distract Tourists From The Lack Of Music And Dancing

TEXT:

NSW Police will have 20,000 fully-armed officers on stand-by in Circular Quay over the next fortnight, As Sydney will be transformed into a ‘spectacular display of light, creativity and ideas’ – as the state forks out close to $10 million in power bills to shine cool pictures on landmarks.

Sydney is reportedly really excited to show off their sterile waterfront, and licensed venues across the city have been warned that ‘this is not about them’.

“If people want to come to Sydney to dance and make a fool of themselves, then we have a perfectly suited entertainment precinct for them in Parramatta,” says NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian.

“It’s technically the geographical centre of Sydney and it’s far enough away from the Harbour to keep the investors and developers happy”

“Vivd is about non-Sydney artists and collectives collaborating to put together the biggest light show in the world, with many sculptures this year focusing on the importance of conservation and the protection of wildlife – or something like that”

NSW Police have advised that any venues playing music at volume higher than what inner-city retirees would deem appropriate will be fined and their licenses place on probation.

George Christensen Admits To Being The Face Of Matchbox 20’s 1996 Breakthrough Album

TEXT:

Federal Member for Dawson, George Christensen MP has today owned up to his past life as a plus-sized male model in the early 1990’s.

Just one month after he last made headlines for outsourcing his weight-loss surgery to a Muslim country, the son of sugarcane barons in North Queensland has admitted to posing for the 1996 breakthrough Matchbox 20 album ‘Yourself or someone like you’.

“There has been some inquiries into my life before politics” he said, in front of a media scrum at Parliament House this morning.

“I think it is time for me to clear up that, after a brief stint in stock photo modelling, I was paid a handsome sum to feature as the face of the the debut studio album by American rock band Matchbox 20”

Released in 1996, ‘Yourself or someone like you’ features a sound similar to traditional rock sound and post-grunge. The album features themes of adolescence, loneliness, psychological abuse, humiliation, depression, anger, and alcoholism. The album sold several million copies in the U.S and was certified Diamond, and it was also certified multi-platinum in Australia, Canada and New Zealand. To date, the album has sold more than 15 million copies worldwide.

Christensen, now an established National Party politician, says every now and then he throws on a couple of Rob Thomas ballads to take himself back to a much simpler time – before he was gifted such grave responsibilities.

“3AM is definitely my favourite track from that album”

“I don’t mind Real World either. It’s the type of music you throw on after a few cane champagnes and hot one”

“Real sing-a-longs, you know”

Clive Palmer A Bit Cranky With Grog Dog After Stepping On Grog Dog’s Grog Bog

TEXT:

Former Federal Member For Fairfax, Clive Palmer, was reportedly running late for all of today’s engagements after an unfortunate start to the morning.

After dressing himself in fine Italian leather and linen for a big day of business, the mining magnate and Tim Tim-enthusiast found himself in an unfortunate predicament after stepping on his grog dog’s grog bog.

“Oh, blast!” shouted the proud Queenslander.

“Grog dog!!!”

It is believed that the iconic Palmer family pet had spent a large night on the cold ones, after knocking off work. His bog was reportedly extra groggy.

The former political renegade turned meme purveyor says he had to spend a couple minutes scraping the grog dog’s grog bog off his shoe, and was, therefore, late for a very important date. Stressed, he then treated himself to several tim tams.

His comments came in the form of a Japanese haiku.

“Dog

On the grog,

in the lawn, a bog

That’s no fun

Smell of rum

On the shoe… Oh stuff you!”

Greek Mate Showing Off At Greek Restaurant

TEXT:

Local Greek and five-eighth for the Betoota Dolphins 3rd grade, Yanni Comino has been thrilled to show off his Southern European heritage at the Windorah Helenic House over the weekend.

Before this week’s bus trip for the thirsty thirds, the 29-year-old accountant had previously only expressed his cultural background by showing an interest in tennis and soccer. Only rarely would he call someone a malaka, and only a few of his mates have been invited to Easter at Yaiya’s.

However, after being the only Greek at his table in a restaurant owned by migrants that come from the same island as his grandfather, Yanni was quick to introduce his relatively uncultured teammates to the ways of the Western Oriental Gentleman.

“We were looking for a place to get a feed before presos and the only place that could fit us was this dodgy Greek joint” said club captain, Jai Pearson.

“Turns out these Greeks don’t mind a drink. They were giving all this liquorice rum and shit”

“Yanni was yelling all this shit at them in another language, I think it was Greek”

Within hours it is believed that the entire restaurant was treated to an appalling football teams rendition of Zorba – while the post-match presentation at the Windorah Steelers clubhouse went ahead without the thirds.

Every single Greek person in Betoota can now expect to hear the word ‘Yassou’ on a daily occasion.

Delilah Hayley-Hughes Jones has never once made a dollar from modeling, writing about, or designing fashion.

However, she does have mid-tier access media passes to the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week in Sydney.

Followers of her apparent blog have not only been made aware of the fact that she has spent the last 72 hours floating around the Sydney Opera House and CarriageWorks event centre, but they also now know the names of every designer responsible for her outfits.

“She must be doing a couple outfit changes a day” says one bloke, who began following her after spotting a few bikini photos in his newsfeed over summer.

“What’s she doing there? We’d know if she was on the runway by now”

“What does she do anyway?”

Delilah belongs to the collective of unemployed journalism graduates that make up the ‘Real Bloggers Of Sydney’ Instagram account – However, as exclusive as that sounds – she is just one of many self-titled ‘influencers’ who have been given full access to the MBFW outdoor areas and coffee stands.

“I just really wanted to get down here and see the new season” says Delilah.

Local Man Admits Defeat And Goes The Blade Two

TEXT:

After years of patch-up jobs, Spanish comb-overs and zany hats, local man, Travis McKinnon, has heeded the advice of fellow tow balls and taken the chop.

In what he admits was a long and drawn out process, McKinnon flirted with the decision to mow off the cal-de-sacs in his hairline for some time.

“The writing’s been on the wall for a while now… or the hairs had been on my pillow probably more aptly… but it’s still not easy. It’s a pain only a bald man can know.”

Explaining what prompted the bold next step in accepting his baldness, the mortgage broker said he could no longer hide his shame… or skull.

“I was standing under strong down lights, looking at myself in the bathroom mirror, and thought ‘Get Fucked!’… so I went to K-Mart and bought a set of Remington clippers”.

Talking about the lengths he’d gone to in the hope of reinvigorating his fledgling mane, McKinnon was proud of the way he took the fight up to male pattern baldness in recent years.

“I’ve tried all the butters and creams. Regaine… Alpecin shampoo… That Warnie shit… I even had a consultation for some “Yeah Yeah”… so I’ve left no comb unturned” he laughed.

Friends have been supportive of McKinnon’s “brave move”, with close mate Ben Rucker saying it’s a “big improvement” and “it’ll be nice having a shower and not stepping on tufts of Trav’s hair.”

McKinnon’s partner, aspiring Make Up Artist, Monique Harvey, is still getting used to the new look, admitting that she “liked him with hair”. But for McKinnon, he’s already reaping the benefits.

“It’s pretty windy outside at the moment, which was traditionally my worst nightmare, but I’m going to head out for lunch today. I’d have never done that with my former crop of feathers.”

But it’s not all good news for McKinnon and his bald brethren, with recent studies showing women actually DON’T prefer bald men, despite what that shared Facebook article says. A spokesperson for the Follicular Health Institute suggested the popularity of actors Jason Statham and Bruce Willis can largely be attributed to their pay checks, and not their chrome domes.

If McKinnon’s worried about any of that, he’s not showing it, and now 24 hours on from his first in a lifetime of future buzz cuts, he is comfortable with his new aerodynamic look.

“There’s only so many times you can wear a fedora without looking like a pedo, so I’m happy to have put those days behind

Local Dad Wins Full Custody Of Kids After Whipping Out Fidget Spinner In Family Court

TEXT:

The final stages of a local family’s divorce settlement made a dramatic turn yesterday afternoon, after the father hijacked all reasonable debate.

Since first separating late last year, Mr Clive Jackson (36) and his estranged, soon-to-be ex wife, Claudia, have been unable to divide their shared estate as well as the custody of their three children without paying several lawyers thousands and thousands of dollars.

Yesterday, the matter finally landed before the Family Court of Australia, which is a superior Australian federal court of record which deals with family law matters, such as divorce applications, parenting disputes, and the division of wealth when a couple separate.

Among other things, Mr Jackson’s vices of gambling, womanising and functional alcoholism that have developed since becoming a bachelor were brought to light, as a counter argument to his claim for majority custody of their three children under 13.

Family Court Judge Richard Belling says it looked like he was going to have an early one.

“grog, strippers, gambling… The moment those ones get trotted out you usually know which way its going to go” he told the Betoota Advocate.

That was, until Mrs Jackson’s overly-ambitious lawyer decided to take things too far.

The Jackson children, who were present, looked on as Mr Jackson sat in the stand.

“What CAN you offer these kids?” asked Claudia’s lawyer.

Mr Jackson went quiet, almost appearing to admit defeat, before bringing out the big guns.

“This!” said Mr Jackson, outstretching his hand to show a fidget spinner in full flight.

The crowd, which included family and friends from both sides of the claim, gasped in awe.

Clive’s fidget spinner prowess became clear as the stress-relieving kid’s toy elegantly bounced across his hand.

“We want DAD!” shouted Jordie, the youngest of the three Jackson children, before his two sibling joined in.

“We want Dad! We want Dad!” they chanted incessantly.

Judge Belling says he had no choice but to award full custody to Mr Jackson, so long as half the estate went to his ex-wife as well as the car.

“I’m fine with that” said Clive.

“You can have it all if you want. I’ve got the spinner”

“Let’s roll kids”

Report: Nothing Wrong With Enjoying A Bit Of Robbie Williams

TEXT:

A recent report by the University Of Western Queensland has found that adults should not feel uncomfortable about enjoying, or even singing along to, British musician Robbie Williams.

Professor Kerrod Walters from UWQ says that the music made by the bad boy of 1999-2005 pop is undeniable good stuff, and that enjoying it is only a natural human response.

32-year-old concreter, Grant Mason, says he is relieved by these findings.

“Anyone who works on a construction site would know how often tradesmen are exposed to the work of Robbie Williams” he said.

“Even with the dial on Triple M, we are exposed to plenty of stuff from Sign when you’re winning (1999)”

“It’s just so fucking good”

The report has found that there is absolutely nothing wrong with knowing all of the lyrics to Love Supreme or Rock DJ – and that grown men especially should feel proud that they do so.

“It’s real babymaking music” says Professor Walters.

“Anyone who tries to say that Robbie Williams’ music is for ‘pansies’ is obviously not 100% comfortable with their own feelings”

“Robbie Williams is the closest thing Gen-Y had to Leonard Cohen”

“The fact is, most people know his music through incessant airplay and touring – so anyone pretending they don’t are the ones that we should be worried about”

The report has also found there is nothing wrong with enjoying any music made by Ricky Martin, James Blunt, Ed Sheeran or Natalie Umbruglia.

Peter Dutton Hires Ja Rule As Key Advisor For Manus And Nauru

TEXT:

Following a string of headlines this week, US rapper Ja Rule has been hired by Australian Minister for Immigration Peter Dutton as a key advisor to Australia’s two offshore Detention Centres for Asylum Seekers and refugees.

Ja Rule’s disastrous, yet lucrative ‘Fyre Music Festival – which resulted in hundreds of rich kids being stranded in the Bahamas after spending upwards of $12,000 each to attend his failed ‘luxury’ music festival – appears to caught the eye of Peter Dutton MP.

Dutton says he was amazed at how the musician-turned-event-promoter was able to turn a desert island full of emergency refuge tents into nothing more than a lesson for the people who went there.

“Mr Rule has shown a unique skillset when it comes to the misinformation needed to relocate voiceless people to destitute tropical islands”

“The fact that these people had spent a lot of money to experience the ‘once-in-a-lifetime” Fyre Music Festival is also very relevant”

“As we have learned that boat people tend to spend their entire life savings to book a spot on these leaky boats heading to Australia – this is why they have such high expectations of how they will be treated”

Dutton has said Ja Rule will be helping to organize below par security and catering contractors for Manus Island and Nauru, as well as helping to draft up the media releases, as like Fyre Festival, no mainstream news outlets have access to Australian offshore detention centres.

This new hiring comes after the news that Peter Dutton demanded an apology from the media for their reporting on the demographics of inmates currently detained in The Manus Regional Processing Centre.

The Minister for Immigration says that journalists had “morphed into advocates” and “lost control of any dispassionate view of this circumstance” by using terms like ‘kids’ and ‘children’ to describe detainees under the age of 13.

Every Single Homeless Person Is 100% Addicted To Ice, Confirms Inner-City Liberal Voter

TEXT:

Inner-city-Melbourne-based resident Michael Lyons, currently advising Government contractors in the CBD on the latest underground road-project, has become aware of the perils of the Ice-problem within the city.

Whilst lunching daily around the Swanston street precinct, he has seen local street dwellers cussing at strangers, and throwing general abuse at shoppers – he says it’s not something he used to see from within the safety of his heavily renovated terrace house just 10 kilometres away.

“It’s a real problem” he says.

“I hear these people get super human strength if they get provoked. I just keep to myself. I don’t even make eye contact”

Despite there being literally thousands of other possible reasons for the city’s homeless to come across as having a screw-loose, Michael has listened to enough conservative commentators discussing the issue on 3AW and 774 to know the real underlying cause.

“I don’t know what we are going to do about it. There was never this many homeless people around when I was growing up in Toorak… It’s completely out of control”

“I don’t understand why they do it to themselves. I never had it easy, but I made sure I never did ICE”

The Betoota Advocate went on to interview one of these apparently drug-riddled gutter-rats by the name of “Jesse”

He says that he ‘was bashed and abused as a kid” – and that the subsequent manic depression he suffers might explains his anti-social behaviour that makes Mr Lyons feel so uncomfortable.

“I really wish it was Ice” he says.

“Unfortunately I lack the interpersonal skills to even find myself a dealer. Let alone the money it costs to do drugs that make me feel better”

Bella Still Getting Mileage Out Of The 12,000 Photos She Took At Coachella

The fact that local woman, Bella Cosimider, has been back at her desk at NRMA for a whole week is yet to stop her non-stop instagramming of photos from the 2019 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.

The 25-year-old claims assessor was just one 190,000 people from right across the world who traveled to Indio, California earlier this month to photograph themselves taking part in musical concerts of many genres, including rock, indie, hip hop, and electronic dance music – as well as art installations and sculptures.

It is believed that just this week alone, Bella has captioned over twenty photos with the words ‘Take me back’ – alongside the now dated #Coachella2019 hashtag.

Despite being unable to name most of the headline acts, or even the Southern Californian town that hosted the event – Bella says attending Coachella was a life-changing experience.

“It was a week of art and music that changed the way I view life and creativity versus reality” she says while breathing onto her sunglasses and polishing them off on her black milk leggings.

“I’m still there, technically. It’s almost like I’m not taking 200 phone calls a day from people who have written their cars off”

With at least eight thousand more photos to get through, Bella says she’s still yet to showcase eight more of the outfits she wore.

Just Press It Again, You Know You Want To

TEXT:

A recent study by the office of Transport and Infrastructure has found that blindly mashing the stop/go button at street crossings is a good way to get across the street faster.

A statement from The Hon Darren Chester MP, Minister for Infrastructure and Transport has revealed that impatient commuters that make a scene by pressing the button heaps are actually onto something.

“What we have found is that the system isn’t automated at all, and the crossing buttons are just waiting for pedestrians to let them know how eager they are to cross the road”

“Our advice to anyone in a rush is the press the button like 5 or 6 times non-stop before letting out a sigh and checking your watch”

“It’s also especially effective if a group of more than 3 people all press it in front of each other”

This comes only a month after the Melbourne City Council revealed they were working on methods of making this experience less frustrating for pedestrians by changing the green cross light to an icon of Shane Warne.

Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said that an Warnie-icon was the most sensible way to appease the left-wing echo chamber who had been getting worked up about gender stereotypes.

“Warnie is an icon in himself. He transcends gender, race and class. He is the pinnacle of Victoria. The greatest thing we have ever produced”

“Shane Keith is universally loved by all sides of politics and all age groups. He will now be entrenched in the heart of our city for many years to come. As a state icon, and a street light icon”

Local whingeing leftie and part-time Moroccan drumming instructor, Niall Lupi, says as hard as he tries, he’s unable to find anything offensive with this new proposed shape of LED lights.

“Warnie… I guess you can’t argue with that”

Migrants Advised Southern Cross Tattoo Easiest Way To Showcase Australian Values

TEXT:

Malcolm Turnbull’s latest attempt at emulating Tony Abbott this week has resulted in a new Citizenship test.

The new test will reflect “Australian values,” despite the Government admitting that they are unsure what values will be assessed and how it will be done.

However, the Advocate can reveal that applicants can pass the test by getting a sizeable Southern Cross (also known as the So-Cro) tattoo emblazoned across their body.

Government officials confirmed this morning that the shortcut would allow any migrants to streamline their citizenship process.

An insider said that; the move will hopefully make Malcolm look more in touch with the “people,” who he referred to with inverted commas.

“Look, Malcolm is so desperate to hold onto the Prime Ministership that he is even thinking about getting one of these tattoo’s himself,” the official how wished to remain anonymous said.

Leader of the United Patriots Front, and well-known web cam ranter Christopher Shortis has criticised the move, saying that the only way to shortcut the test should be having satisfactorily white skin.

Oddly, another element of the new test will be filtering out people with a history of domestic violence, which seems distinctly at odds with the aforementioned “Aussie values.”

Leader of the Opposition Bill Shorten responded to our questions with a melodic “Save Medicare” chant.

1st-Year Art Student Perfectly Captures North Shore Upbringing In 8th Biggie Smalls Portrait

TEXT:

18-year-old Sydney art student, Hannah Clarke, doesn’t expect her lecturers to understand the unique connection she holds with the late Christopher George Latore Wallace, a Brooklyn-based US rapper that died roughly twelve months before she was born.

She says she’s been into ‘Biggie’ ever since she heard the “Notorious B.I.G. & The XX – Dead Wrong Remix” on Youtube during a high school house party in Sydney’s affluent Lavender Bay three years ago.

“When the movie came out, I was basically the only girl in my circle that knew his music. I preferred Biggie over Tupac”

After deciding against studying finance/business, Hannah decided to play up on her role as the ‘arty friend’ in her all girls school social circle – she says after three months studying both theory and practice at a famous Sydney art school, she has already painted eight portraits of Biggie Smalls.

Her most recent portrait has blown away all of her family and friends that aren’t associated with her art college.

“The lecturers don’t get it because they don’t know hip hop”

“They’d much prefer me to paint a landscape or something actually related to our curriculum, but I just want to be honest with it”

“I know they won’t ever understand. But this was us. Biggie Smalls was a soundtrack to life on the North Shore line”

With her lecturers begging her to channel her energy and artistic promise into something more related to the early subjects of her degree, Hannah says she’s in half a mind to showcase her work in a self-run exhibition in one of the shopfronts of her father’s investment properties in Cremorne.

“I don’t necessarily think I need to do things the old way. I don’t even think I’ll be finishing my degree if I keep getting such harsh criticism like I am now” she says.

“I’ve got 1000 followers on my official artist Instagram. My work speaks for itself, I’ve even pulled back on the bikini shots”

“Plus I’m getting heaps of commissions from my friend’s parents and other people from the golf club”

Report Finds Kasey Was Definitely Pretty Enough

TEXT:

Nearly two decades of academic research has resolved the subject question of Kasey Chambers’ hit 2001 single, Not Pretty Enough.

According to, Shaun Nesser, a researcher from the University of Western Queensland, the 40-year-old Australian Country music singer-songwriter was, and still is, definitely pretty enough.

“There’s no question about it” he said.

“She had all the markers of 2001 South Australian country-pop-star beauty, notably a spiked updo and brightly-coloured satin formal dress.”

The SoFresh: Hits of September 2001 song had an important message, Nesser continues:

“This was the most pressing question of Australian country music as it shifted from the shindig-bush-dance 1900s to the arena-driven Swiftie 2010s”

“Miss Chambers’ song was an allegory for global country music’s then-declining popularity, disguised as a school disco slow-dance.”

Betoota Pub patron Louise Picket said of the study: “Yeah the chorus made me pretty sad, I might belt it for open mic tonight.”

Picket’s husband, Grant, says he definitely thinks Chambers was pretty enough and the same goes for his missus.

Report Finds High School Girls Spend 85% Of Their Lives Hugging

TEXT:

A group of popular female students from Joan Of Arc Ladies College in North Betoota have spent the last five minutes locked in a deep embrace for no reason.

This follows new findings in a recent report by the CSIRO which suggests that popular high school girls spend upwards of 85% of their school recess and lunch breaks hugging each other.

The fact that both Kelly and Millie are both going out with the most popular footballers in their grade, who they love more than their own stupid parents, has ruled out that this particular hug is anyway romantic.

Aside from Kelly pointing out that she has ‘missed Millie so much’ since the last time they saw each other at morning tea, just over an hour ago, witnesses are unable to explain why this deep embrace has lasted so long

The girls’ teacher, Janette Pearson (72), says she the contrived-teenage-girl-hug is one of her least favourite phases.

“It’s quite dramatic and annoying” she says.

“I don’t think it’s healthy for them pretending to be such good friends when I know for a fact that Millie won’t be talking to Kelly next week when she finds out that her boyfriend has been walking home from school with another girl in the group the Kelly used to sit with”

However, this kind of short-lived, transient social hierarchyy does not seem to stop the hugging, which is expected to die down as the girl enter their senior exams in 6 months.

“Oh my God I’ve missed you so much. I’ve got soooo much to tell you” says Milly.

“Johnathon is being suchhh a psycho”

Pauline Advises North Queenslanders Do Their Own Research On Cyclone Preparation

TEXT:

A mass evacuation is currently being carried out in the Queensland town of Mackay as the ever-growing Cyclone Debbie threatens to cause widespread destruction as it collides with a high tide.

Authorities are urging about 25,000 residents in “low-lying areas” of Mackay to evacuate their homes immediately.

“We are asking people that can move out of those low-lying areas that are depicted on the local maps on the council website to move now,” said the Dawson MP, George Christensen

“Everyonee else. I would advise to begin sandbagging, tying down loose structures and stocking up on emergency survival goods”

However, One Nation leader Pauline Hanson has come out as an SES sceptic this evening, telling media that the commonly accepted attitude towards cyclone preparation is unsound.

“I advise parents to go out and do their own research with regards to cyclone preparation because they can “have an effect on some children”.

It’s not the first time Hanson has questioned cyclone preparation — last January, she made the long-discredited and rubbished claim that sandbags can cause autism, and even cancer.

“We haven’t done the research enough, what is causing these kids to have autism, what is having all the cancer in our community, have we had enough answers into the cancer?”

Hanson criticised the state of emergency laws which block welfare payments for parents who don’t prepare for cyclones.

“What I don’t like about it is the blackmailing that’s happening with the government. Don’t do that to people. That’s a dictatorship. I think people have a right to investigate themselves,” she said.

Even Victorian Police Impressed By Apex Gang’s Ability To Steal F1 Car From Albert Park

TEXT:

Both Victorian Police and the Premier’s Office have this afternoon admitted that they are nothing short of impressed by the notorious Melbourne youth gang ‘Apex’.

After over 18 months of ‘declaring war’ against the troubled teenagers with a penchant for carjacking, just about everyone in Melbourne has to pay credit where credit is due, after several members of the non-organised criminal gang managed to steal a fully modified F1 car from the pits at Albert park this afternoon.

Premier Andrews says he finds it ‘so fucking funny’ to see the live chopper footage of a formula one car burning through suburban streets.

“Fuck me. These kids are good!” he said.

“And even though I condemn this pointless criminal I activity, I think I speak for my entire office, and the Victorian police, when I say that these fucked up kids have truly impressed us”

This spectacular auto-theft comes ahead of the Melbourne Grand Prix opening the Formula One season for the 19th time this weekend. An highly-anticipated event that has motorsport fans looking forward to a jam-packed opening weekend, that will cost the city millions and seriously fuck up some of the streets.

With the stolen F1 currently being pursued in Melbourne’s deep Northern Suburbs, organisers of the Grand Prix are now in damage control.

“How the fuck did those little pricks get in there?” asked one Melbourne City Organiser.

“They would have had to scale like three barbed wire fences and evade at least twenty security guards”

“It’s not like you are going to miss a 6 foot teenager walking through the pits. Especially when he’s that black”

According to the Oxford Dictionary, ‘the Apex gang’ is a term loosely applied to any male teenager of South Sudanese or Samoan heritage who has brushed the wrong side of the law.

This trend of labeling any troubled kids, that aren’t white, gang members – comes from media outlets finding it is easier to sell papers when they can present several isolated incidents as something more than it is. Like an organised criminal gang of over 1000 people aimed and stealing cars and driving them for fun.

However, even the media is cheering on the Apex gang today, as they continue their high speed televised police chase into the rural suburbs of greater Melbourne.

“How fucking good!” says Triple M announcer Eddie McGuire.

“These kids have got me all geed up! Quick! Get the microphone away from me before I say something racist”

Waleed Aly, from Channel 10’s the project says that it’s great seeing young kids channel their energy into putting on a show.

“Did you see that bloke evade the spike strips just outside Lalor Plaza? Talk about skills!”

“I’d have that kid on our show if he wasn’t 90% illiterate and suffering PTSD from being pinballed through Australian detention centres after fleeing war-torn Sudan”

Today’s hilarious speed chase – now colloquiually dubbed ‘The Light Up’ – isn’t the first time that the state has put their prejudice aside and congratulated this supposed group of criminally-minded youths.

Just last month, Premier Daniel Andrews and Victorian Minister for Corrections, Gayle Tierney made the executive decision to allow temporary clemency to Apex members who were jailed with auto-theft convictions. A move aimed at helping the RSPCA rescue pets locked in hot cars during the city’s most recent heatwave.

Teresa Divine, A spokeswoman for the RSPCA says the Apex gang members are making life much easier for the organisation.

“They are really channeling there skills into something more positive. We’d love to hire a few of these kids, but unfortunately they are already within the prison system and probably won’t ever get a proper job for the rest of their life”

“I guess that’s what happens when you steal peoples cars. You pay for it for the rest of your life. But there would have been a lot of dead pets in Melbourne today if it wasn’t for these helpful young men”

“You should have seen B-Dog put a crow bar through the windshield of this Range Rover in Toorak. I’ve never seen anyone move that quickly to save a little a pooch”

Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews has said that, when and if they are apprehended, the F1 thieves will be sent to prison for ten years sentences.

20-Year-Old VICE Writer Pens 600 Words On Why The Beatles Are Overrated And Problematic

TEXT:

Following the death of iconic American musician Fats Domino late last year, tributes have flowed from rock’n’roll greats who credit the singer for his influence on modern music

The remaining members of The Rolling Stones and The Beatles are just some of the stars to attribute their careers to the late singer-songwriter, who is being remembered as the true inventor of rock music.

However, Sydney-based VICE magazine content writer, Natalia Lawson (20), has decided to take it a step further – in a 600-word listicle outlining not only the life of the deceased musician she has only just heard about – but also her opinion on how overrated The Beatles are.

Titled “Why I Just Don’t Get The Whole Beatles Thing” – Lawson’s piece delves into the personal lives of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr – and uses her limited knowledge of musical theory to criticize the multi-Grammy Award winning musical institution.

“Cultural appropriation served with a nationalistic British garnish of bowl cuts and cheeky smiles… Not for me thanks” writes Lawson, whose last six articles have been sponsored posts for NSW TAFE.

“I might be missing something here… But I think I know what opportunism in the music industry looks like when I see it”

Natalie, who graduated from University three months ago and has never been to England, says to champion The Beatles for being a British version of Fats Dominos is the same as wearing blackface at a dress up party.

However, local roadie and sound and tech guy at the Rooty Hill RSL, Glenn, says Natalie Is simply wrong.

“The Beatles are fucking grouse” says Glenn.

“So is Elvis. So is Chuck Berry… What the fuck does this journo know about timelessness. She’ll be running an instagram page for a Mexican bar in 6 months”

“Yes, You Can Pay Eftpos At My Empty Cafe But You Should Feel Privileged To Do So”

TEXT:

An inner-city Betoota cafe owner is charging 50 cents extra for any customer who requires eftpos, despite not looking like he can really afford to pick and choose, it has been confirmed.

Despite making a sustainable amount of money each day on this essentially cost-free service, local barista Kai Dixon (32) is still acting like the three hand movements he makes to complete a purchase is an absolute privilege for his customers.

“Aaaah… Eftpos?” he says, as though every second customer isn’t paying by card.

“That’s going to cost you 50 cents more. That alright?”

“Just so you know, this a big inconvenience to me and I almost feel as though I should say no to your request to use this machine that I have hooked up next to the register”

With his cafe traffic booming during rush house, to the point where most customers have to line up, Kai is yet to experience a customer who doesn’t hesitantly agree to his swindling.

One local customer, Rick, is fed up.

“How about he gets rid of that fucking machine and we’ll see how much business he gets”

“No one is walking around with three dollars in coins anymore. It’s not 1995”

“The fucking hide he must have to pretend eftpos isn’t his most popular form of payment”

However, Kai, who recently went on a two-day bender with his other cafe-owner mates after learning of the Fair Work Commission’s decision to scrap Sunday penalty rates for casual employees, says people don’t understand how hard it is to hook up an eftpos machine to the phone line that was already functional when he moved in to the shop four years ago.

“It’s a cost that I have to wear. We don’t get any support from the government to help build these services”

Report: ‘Mates’ Who Sack-Wack When The Chips Are Down Most Likely Have Shit Banter

TEXT:

An over-the-top mate has started dishing out sack wacks on day two of a heavy bucks party trip, it has been confirmed.

Some of the boys believe it is because of the fact that Luke can’t seem to drink as much as the rest of them, and therefore needs to take things up a notch with juvenile pranks made popular by older brothers back in the day.

“Fuck me that cained” said one victim, Riley, using an outdated word that hasn’t been thrown around since the last time he was sack wacked in 2003.

“Fuck off cunt. That’s fucked” he says, while taking in deep breaths.

Over making three clean connections with three seperate left testicles belonging to the least expecting partygoers, Riley has promised the boys he’s done.

“I don’t believe the cunt” said the weekend’s buck, Jordan.

“He’s a fuckwit. Who does that shit. Who even invited him”

Riley says everyone needs to just harden up and its a bit of fun.

With the sack-wack spree taking place out front of the next planned venue of the weekend pub crawl, the boys are expecting to be denied entry.

“If we get denied entry you can wait outside cunt” says Jordon.

Online Political Commentator Starting To Really Feel Himself Judging By New Shirtless Videos

TEXT:

An opinionated Facebook user has stumbled across some sort of social media fame today, after posting an aggressive video rant on his timeline about some mundane thing that resonates with other people.

The video, which is titled: “Something that’s really been pissing me off lately” – has been liked by over 2000 people, some who don’t even know the 28-year-old – who goes by the name of Troy.

Throughout the eight-minute video, Troy takes aim at people that don’t realise he has a dash cam, overprotective parents and a culture of political correctness gone mad. Troy is also seen to be blatantly breaking the law by using his iPhone video camera while driving.

“I know I’m probably going to offend a few people, but I think a few people need a teaspoon of concrete” he says, before being told by a stranger that he is “100% bang on” in the video comments.

Followers have also noticed Troy’s new interest in filming these video rants while shirtless, a sign that his recent clenbuterol abuses have really been paying off.

Troy, who isn’t oblivious to the fact that most of his mates now consider him famous, says he’s going to make a dash at sharing a few more opinions on ‘viral’ Facebook videos.

“I’m thinking about another one” he says to The Betoota Advocate today.

“About gluten-free people”

“Like, half of them aren’t even allergic to gluten. Just fuck up aye”

Hangover Hurting Enough To Warrant The Use Of Outdoor Furniture In Shower

TEXT:

A local resident’s hangover is so bad that the only option available for life to continue is to place a garden chair in the shower and turn it on full blast.

It is believed, that when combined with suburban thai food and gatorade, a ‘chair-shower’ is an acceptable last resort for people who have drunk so much booze the night before that they forget when to breathe.

“Sometimes, it’s the only thing that makes me feel like I don’t have an Greek teenager’s subwoofer inside my brain” said local women, Fliss Dodson.

“I actually have had glandular fever before I reckon even at its worst, it felt better than the last half an hour has felt”

“Fuck this shit”

“I can still taste that weird coffee liquor all those blokes were buying us last night”

As mentioned in The Betoota Advocate last week, drinking shower water has for many years been considered a staple part of Australian mornings after, as a quick and thorough way of hydrating, while also not having to think too much about doing anything.

This method has been utilised in the new introduction of hangover clinics, for people rich enough to pay their way out of a hangover.

Clinic nurse Beryl Wang says that drinking shower water is a part of traditional Australian medicine and has been thought to help cure hangovers for generations.

“Modern scientific medicine will tell you that rehydrating is key to getting over a hangover,” she said. “We use more traditional methods, like putting a hash brown in a bacon and egg roll or enjoying a naughty inside cigarette.”

In addition to the chairs, Indian food can be administered intravenously while a patient lies in bed watching reruns of The Simpsons on Fox8.

If you’re easily scared by needles, then the nurses can organise for a feeding tube to be used instead.

However, local shower-chairer Fliss says that she can’t afford a visit to the hangover clinic and three showers between zooper doopers will have to do.

Pauline Promises Voters She’ll Make Sure No One Calls Them Dumb Ever Again

TEXT:

Senator Pauline Hanson has drawn roars of support from a crowd of imminent One Nation voters, in some town that Bill Shorten and Annastacia Palaszczuk has never heard of, today.

Standing on a podium with an 5 x 5 metre Australian flag draped behind her, Hanson assured the crowd that, aside from the random influx of political donations she has taken from anonymous sources, she was the only candidate that was listening to their cries.

“I know how you feel. I know how these politicians make you feel. I promise you that, if you keep voting for me, you will never, ever be made to feel stupid again”

“I promise, that if you vote for me, I will draft out thousands of new laws that will make your lives better than they have ever been”

“I will make this town the richest town in Australia. I promise you that every single one of you will be a millionaire”

With her new ‘Battler Bus’ parked behind her and a growing crowd on undecided Queensland voters, Pauline Hanson has promised that life will be so much better if people recklessly vote for her unvetted candidates

Local voter, Paul Clearey (55) says that if what Pauline is saying is true, she would be the best Prime Minister Australia’s ever had.

“I’m sick of hearing words like ‘sycophant’ and ‘plebescite’ – I want a leader who speaks my language, or at least dumbs herself down to speak my language”

Another supporter said Pauline seems too good to be true, but of course he’s going to vote for her over some fuckwit wearing a suit in Melbourne, or Sydney.

“She’s the only one talking about Muslims.

“I didn’t even know how dangerous they were until I saw her talking about them on Sunrise. And now, she’s the only one doing anything about it”

Unattended Country Road Bag At House Party Definitely Has A Few Cruisers Stashed In It

TEXT:

An unattended Country Road tote bag sitting in an empty room at a house party is most likely full of warm but delicious vodka cruisers, it has been confirmed.

It is believed that the carry bag, notorious within private school girl circles, also probably has a phone charger and some expensive beauty products in it, making it a sitting duck for gatecrashers.

The bags owner, Maddie, who is currently on the dance floor, has no idea that her belongings are being eyed off by drunk blokes who are sick of drinking beer and need a bit of a sugar hit.

“It’ll be fine in that room, won’t it?’ she says to the hosts, who don’t why she bought the large travel bag to such an event.

“Yeah. Sure” says the host, Brett.

However, Antony – a dodgy but well-known friend of the host has had enough drinks for his fingers to get a little bit sticky.

“I bet you there is some guava flavoured pre-mixers in that bad boy” he says as his eyes light up.

“Maybe even an iPad or something… Not that I’d steal an iPad… But I’m gonna have a look anyway”

With the party now at full capacity, there is a huge chance Maddie will be posting some sort of panicked comment on the event’s Facebook page tomorrow morning, before returning to the house and enlisting the hungover housemates to help her find her missing belongings.

Brisbane Man Showing Human Emotion In Sydney Pub At Risk Of Having Venue Shut Down

TEXT:

After recently relocating to Sydney for work, Brisbane bloke Tom Coffey (26) doesn’t realise how uncomfortable the heavily legislated Southerners feel when exposed to his genuinely emotive personality.

In a city that feels like it is completely acceptable to tell pubs and bars what types of drinks they can serve, with what mixers, between what hours, in what suburbs – Tom is oblivious to the fact that laughing and yahooing can easily be mistaken for severe intoxication in the city that fun forgot.

“I had a mate come down to visit me so we went out for a few beers” said Tom.

“He cracked this hilarious joke about something that had happened in his life, and I just couldn’t stop laughing. It was quite a belly laugh”

“All of a sudden we noticed the whole atmosphere change. The bartender went white in the face. The manager blackened the windows with curtains and carefully walked to the front door to see if anyone was around”

As Tom and his mate Dom quickly found out, their vibrant mood was enough to have every hospitality worker within 50 metres of them put out of work.

“It felt like we were in 1940s France. They were terrified that the police might have heard me laughing”

As outlined in the NSW Liquor Act, the service of alcohol to a disorderly or intoxicated person can result in a $60,000+ fine for a venue and a $10,000 dollar fine for the individual. These laws appear quite overboard considering most people’s entire idea of a pub or bar is a place that you go to to get pissed.

“We weren’t even that pissed” said Tom.

“But that was the plan… I mean, what is the fundamental point of a pub or bar anyway? I think everyone needs to ask themselves that, if you don’t want people to get intoxicated, ban alcohol”

“But yeah… We realised that this city is so moderated that you’ll get accused of this shit before it even happens. It’s like minority report”

Aside from alcohol, the NSW Government’s controversial ‘Hillsong Sharia’ (lock-out laws) also aims to ban ‘projectable audio’ – a form of entertainment that is well known for waking up Baby Boomers that decided to retire in the inner city.

Just this week Sydney declared imminent changes to how much outdoor noise can be made at the international tourism and entertainment landmark, the Sydney Opera House, after the iconic venue was ordered to pay a $15,000 fine for exceeding noise limits during a forecourt concert by Florence and the Machine.

Man Criticised For Being ‘Whipped’ After Reigning In Alcoholism And Having Regular Sex

TEXT:

Former grogmonster, Spero Gardiner (28) is now an indoor cat, according to his mates.

After years of setting the tone when it came to social activities within his friendship circle, Spero now has landed himself a lovely girlfriend, and is really enjoying his new life of Friday night hummus and Sunday arvo bush walks.

His mates say that while they are disappointed, he really has got himself a real keeper.

“Look, she’s lovely” says close mate Nippo.

“But we are at a loss without him. There’s much less momentum for the rest of us single blokes. We have essentially all become indoor cats now too and we don’t get any of the perks…”

“…Like yoghurt on cereal and stuff. He’s been in a good paddock since he shacked up”

However, it seems Spero might have put a few of the lads off side during his recent appearance at the local. When asked if he was out for a big night, Spero’s answer and subsequent explanation was quite patronising.

“You only really go out all night to get on the grog with your mates and pick up a bird…” he said.

“But if you’ve already got a bird… What’s the point in staying out”

The entire venue stopped in complete silence, with only the hint of pokie machine’s feature in the background.

Spero, realising that he had just essentially told his six best mates that he doesn’t need them anymore, was speechless himself.

“I going to have to kindly ask you to leave, Spero” said the publican, breaking the silence.

“Get out”

Spero was last seen booking an uber behind the skip bin in the pub’s car park.

Tamworth Man In Double Bay Orders Ham And Pineapple Pizza Without Flinching

TEXT:

While successfully being able to pretend he isn’t from the country most of the time, one Tamworth man has exposed himself after ordering a ‘ham & pineapple’ pizza at a high-end Sydney Italian diner.

Bill Goucher (30) was making good ground on his blind date with a friend of a friend, before he ordered the iconic regional Australian dish at a Michelin-hatted Italian restaurant.

The blind date, a 25-year-old sales professional by the name of Anna, says she was shocked that he didn’t even make the effort to say ‘Hawaiian’.

“They probably wouldn’t have been so shocked if he said something else like Hawaiian or Havana…”

“They asked him if that’s what he meant to say and he said no”

Bill was stern in sticking to his original order

“No. I didn’t mean Hawiian”

“I would like a Ham and pineapple thanks. Do you do it on the thick crust?”

While showing the confidence of someone who definitely has enough money to get what he wants regardless of how uncultured he looks, the waiters at Guido El Rossi were quick to rush through Bill’s order which involves roughly four ingredients.

After two hours of seemingly unnoticed culture clashes the Sydney-based grain trader asks if he can order two Bundaberg rum and cokes ‘without the pre-mix shit’.

“I want the real Coca-Cola, if you don’t mind. Send one of these young fellas across the road to get 1.25L if you have to”

Tony Abbott Having A Bit Of Trouble Selling This Whole Proud To Be Catholic Thing

TEXT:

While the current political climate of preference deals with One Nation and backbencher hostage scenarios might seem like a good time for Liberal MP Tony Abbott to reappear in the public eye, it is believed that he will remain out of sight until everyone stops talking about how his Church molested 1880 kids in his lifetime.

As the most devout Catholic Prime Minister in recent history, Tony Abbott was far more critical of the flaws of the 1.8 billion Muslims around the world than he was his own Church, who’s highest ranking clergyman has today been arrested for a number of historical child sex crimes.

In February it was revealed that 20% of the Catholic Church’s clergymen were alleged pedophiles, as the Royal Commission found that the Catholics were the most likely religious order to be involved in Institutional Child Abuse.

When asked about his current relationship with one of the most notorious criminal organisations in Australian history, Abbott responded with “I… aahhh… I’ve given you the response you deserve”.

Liberal Party bad boy, Christopher Pyne MP says that although Turnbull managed to roast Shorten about being a sycophant several months ago, he is still very much a sitting duck for another Liberal spill.

“While it would be great for the Australian people to have their seventh Prime Minister in 10 years, we need to be wary of the fact that Abbott has been photographed with heaps of dodgy characters”

“I mean Turnbull’s been photographed with countless dodgy characters, but he was representing most of them in court, not using them as spiritual leaders”

Apex Gang Members Released From Jail To Assist RSPCA In Saving Pets Locked In Hot Cars

The Bureau of Meteorology has said the temperature in Victoria went up from 30C to 31C between midnight and 1:30am this morning due to hot northerly winds. The entire state is currently sweltering through a heatwave, with the mercury tipped to soar to 44C in the north of the state today.

In direct response to the unexpected heatwave, the RSPCA have made calls for all Australians to remember to not lock their pets in cars today. As they respond to hundreds of reports surrounding animals overheating.

In a surprising move to help assist the animal rescue group, both Premier Daniel Andrews and Victorian Minister for Corrections, Gayle Tierney have made the executive decision to allow temporary clemency to the members of the notorious Apex street gang with auto-theft convictions.

“What we have here is a select group of at-risk youth with a select set of skills. Usually we wouldn’t be congratulating these boys, but in this exact scenario, they are of great assistance” said the Premier.

When asked by reporters if it was irresponsible to allow convicted gang members back onto the streets, even temporarily, the Premier lost his temper.

“Do you want the job done fast or do you want the job done well?!” he roared.

“When it comes to a pooch locked in a car in thirty fuckin’ degrees, I don’t think the answer should be fast”

“Now these kids are obviously fucked up, but that know how to get in and out of cars very quickly, without keys. They have proven to be of great assistance”

Teresa Divine, A spokeswoman for the RSPCA says the Apex gang members are making life much easier for the organisation.

“They are really channeling there skills into something more positive. We’d love to hire a few of these kids, but unfortunately they are already within the prison system and probably won’t ever get a proper job for the rest of their life”

“You should have seen B-Dog put a crow bar through the windshield of this Range Rover in Toorak. I’ve never seen anyone move that quickly to save a little a pooch”

Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews has said that the gang members will return to prison immediately after the heatwave is over, and will finish the rest of their ten years sentences. 

He’s also announced thousands of more policeman to hit the streets in 2017 to bring down the notorious Apex gang by giving disadvantaged kids better access to education and positive activities.

Federal Government Compulsorily Acquires QLD Farming Land For Pheasant Hunting Weekends

TEXT:

The Queensland Government has condemned Federal Government plans to compulsorily acquire its properties for the construction of a giant pheasant hunting for Sydney and Melbourne MP’s

The Cabinet is aiming to take over a number of prime cattle properties around Shoalwater Bay, near Rockhampton in central Queensland, and introducing pheasants, to give our leaders a chance to unwind

Pheasant shooting is the sport of game shooting and is most popular in the United Kingdom but is practiced in other parts of the world. Shooting of game birds is carried out using a shotgun, as well as some gorgeous dobermans. It is usually seen as a sport practiced by the wealthy and the ruling elite

But the Queensland Government is calling for the Commonwealth to find alternatives to the proposal.

Malcolm Turnbull’s office has today pleaded with farmers to please let them do it, because that’s what they do in England and it looks fun.

“This proposal is perfect for entertaining Charles and Camilla. It’s not much, only a few thousand hectares”

Mundine Pulls Out Of Fight After Being Called ‘UnAustralian’ By Daily Telegraph Readers

TEXT:

Initial reports suggest that Anthony Mundine may be pulling out of his upcoming bout against Danny Green, after being called ‘UnAustralian’ by people who openly dislike Aboriginal and Muslim people – According to the Daily Telegraph.

“We don’t think there’s any coming back from this” says one Daily Telegraph journalist.

“He’s been called ‘UnAustralian’ at least 40 times today – and as we know, It’s probably one of the most offensive words in the Australian vocabulary:

However, experts from the Australian Council Of Social Services (ACOSS) believe that Indigenous boxer, Anthony Mundine, probably doesn’t care that people like you think he is unAustralian.

One sociologist has said that the annual pseudo-racist-pre-Mundine-fight-hysteria probably doesn’t hurt his feelings as much as you think it would.

“We realise a lot of people are throwing the word ‘UnAustralian’ around right now, given Mr Mundine’s recent comments. But I think as a Muslim Aboriginal, he probably isn’t lining up to join the ranks of Australia’s white community”

The recent rise in Daily Telegraph readers referring to Mundine as UnAustralian, comes after he publicly branded the Australian national anthem “racist” and made it clear that will not acknowledge it before his boxing rematch against Danny Green on Friday night.

Mundine says he has “no choice” to take a seat when indigenous singer Jessica Mauboy sings the anthem in front of 30,000 spectators at Adelaide Oval.”First and foremost I want to focus on the fight,” he said.

“I’m not trying to divide people or be controversial but you’ve asked the question and I’m answering it honestly to tell people where I stand. We’re not young and free.”

“My people are still being oppressed. Nothing’s changed … the anthem isn’t right. It’s not for all of Australia. I just can’t stand up for something I don’t believe in.”

Local Daily Telegraph reader, Keiran Keithington, who supports Danny Green purely because he isn’t Aboriginal, can’t believe that ‘the cocky little black Muslim prick [Mundine] doesn’t want to be one of us”

“Why wouldn’t he want to be? He’s just UnAustralian”

“I’ve always hated the bloke. Always trying to push his 60,000 years of history onto all of us. Just get over it”

The recurring pre-Mundine hysteria was outlined earlier this year in the viral article by the Betoota Advocate, 9 Things Aboriginal People Have In Common With Racist People.

“For the most part, a large portion of Australia is usually heavily invested in any boxing match that stars the famous Aboriginal Boxer known as Anthony Mundine.

However, Racist Australians and Aboriginals are the most likely to book a Mundine fight on Pay-Per-View.

The two communities have two different reasons for shelling out $50 dollars for a two hour display of low-quality undercards.

The Aboriginal community tune in to watch their deadly brother silence the critics.

The Racist community purchase the bouts on Pay-Per-View for the off-chance that they might get to witness an American boxer they have never heard of knock that cocky black bastard the fuck out.”

Experts predict Mundine will probably beat Green again, before being accused of fighting dirty by people from his home country who openly hate him and can’t believe he won’t stand for their anthem.

Man Who Can’t Stop Celebrating What Happened Tells Blackfellas To Get Over What Happened

TEXT:

Australia’s Far-Right movement are starting to show signs of weariness with just hours until January 26th, also known as Australia Day, a public holiday that has become the topic of fierce debate this time each year.

With nearly a month of gradual hysteria surrounding the date coming to a close, members from Reclaim Australia are having trouble articulating exactly what it is that they want.

“We don’t want these stinking lefties changing the date” says high-ranking far-right, Kai Blottrell.

“They keep saying that we shouldn’t celebrate Australia Day because it marks the beginning of a nasty colonial settlement”

“Get over what happened”

“This isn’t what Australia Day is about. It’s about me and my mates celebrating what happened, and you getting over it and pretending it never happened.”

Kai says Australia Day is being politicised – and people are trying to make it about something that it isn’t about.

“It’s always been a holiday, and now these lefties are making it about something else”

“It’s always been about drinking piss – well since 1994 anyway”

“If I had my way there’d be no citizenship ceremonies on Australia Day. It takes away from how Australian we are if we let more people in to be Australians. On Australia Day of all days.

Tracy Grimshaw Arrested For Cutting Brakes At Car Show In Effort To Stop Out-Of-Control Hoons

TEXT:

Channel Nine’s A Current Affair’s Tracy Grimshaw has been apprehended by security this morning, after gatecrashing a Melbourne community event, armed with a pair of side cutters.

The media personality’s long-running feud with the nation’s hoons reached boiling point today as she was spotted cutting the brakes of heavily modified cars at a suburban car show.

Police arrived at the scene shortly after where they were informed by Grimshaw that ‘these hoons are disturbing the peace every night in some suburbs, some of the things they get up to, you’d have to see, to believe”

The police informed Grimshaw that it is not her duty to do their job.

“Up to 160 kilometres an hour. Sometimes more” she replied, as though she was talking to the camera.

“We caught up with just some of the neighbours who say they are fed up”

“These hoons must be stopped, police say they can do nothing”

The police then informed her that the only thing they were going to do was arrest her.

Grimshaw has since been released from custody, and will tell her story to everyone on a special 60 Minutes next fortnight.

“Let’s Take This Out Onto The Deck” Says Dad

Local dad, Grant Maryborough (56) hasn’t had an alcoholic drink in a licensed venue since 2012.

In the four years since then, every bit of socialising or unwinding has taken place on top of his deck. A slatted timber attachment to his post-war Queenslander style house.

“It’s all you could want, mate” he says.

“We even extended the corrugated iron roof so we can drink out here in the summer storms”.

With his youngest sons 21st taking place in a nearby pub. Grant doesn’t think he’ll stick around much longer than the speeches.

“I think I’ll peel off with a couple of his mates parents and hit the deck”

Local bloke asks to ‘borrow a ciggie’ he has absolutely no intention of returning

TEXT:

There’s always one at each party – and last Saturday night, it was Ethan Whistler.

Unfortunately for the West Betoota piano tuner, he couldn’t stretch the weekly budget far enough to include his usual assorted box of cleanskin whites and a man-sized packet of Horizon Blues for the weekend.

But recoil in fear he did not, the 29-year-old put on his favour denim jacket that he fished out of the local Seventh-Day Adventist charity bin late last year and headed out into the sticky January evening.

Managing to jag himself a couple rogue Powers Gold tins out of the bath, the next thing on his mind was to wrap his lips around somebody else’s lung candy.

“Hey mate, do you mind if I borrow a ciggie,” he said to The Advocate’s own Dennis Hickey, the resident meteorologist. “Oh, I can’t roll. Can you roll it for me? Cheers bro.”

Not wanting to make a scene, Hickey proceeded to part with his Port Royal – taking the time to really stretch and thin out his precious tobacco donation as to minimise the damage to his own breast pocket.

“Fuck me dead, mate. I felt like I was pregnant in Ipswich,” said Dennis. “Smoking for two. But he was pretty harmless, I guess.”

However, as he began to enjoy the rich taste and satisfying refreshment from the Port Royal he’d only just managed to snaffle, the owner of the house and the Gold tin in his paw quickly put an end to it.

West Betoota Police are urging anyone with information about an alleged assault on Ethan Borrice Whistler of Kelvin Road North, to call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or use the Crime Stoppers online reporting page: https://nsw.crimestoppers.com.au/

Newcastle Steelworker Catches Himself Thinking About The Nineties Again

TEXT:

Newcastle steelworker, Gary Johns (42), has found himself thinking about the best years of his life again. The nineties.

Knowing that he’ll be in an emotional mood for the rest of the afternoon, Mr Johns says he can’t help but shake the guitar riff from Silverchair’s ‘Freak’ out of his head.

“It was a beautiful time to be a Novacastrian” he says, fighting back tears.

Culminating in a 1997 Grand Final win in the rugby league, the residents of the central New South Wales town of Newcastle had a lot to celebrate in the 1990s.

Aside from the development of the Stockton bridge, which the town still holds close to their heart, there was also a seemingly endless supply of high-paying blue collar jobs on the wharfs, in the steel mill and in the factories building trains.

“That Grand Final was the best day of my life” says while Gary re-enacting the Robbie O’Davis post try dance before breaking into a Ray Warren impersonation “Newcastle has won the Grand Final”

Gary says he can remember the Spud/Harrigan brawls like they were yesterday.

“It was magical mate. We had it all. Everyone had work and our footy team was delivering every week”

“We’d finish a week at the steel works, nail a couple of schooeys at queens wharf and some VCRs to get the night started. Hunter street was thumping, we’d end up at Fannies”

“Joey was the wildest one at the pub and he’d still get man of the match at marathon the next day. These days there’s no VCRs, no Fannies, no hill at Marathon…”

“Darby’s pies are still a dollar though” he said consoling himself with a smile.

“And now we’ve got Ponga and Pearcey… This town has still got it”

“6 in a row got me vibing”

Nightclub Shut Down After Taking Too Long To Upload Previous Weekend’s Photos

TEXT:

A popular Brisbane club on Ann Street in Fortitude Valley has closed its doors after 14 years of operation after it failed to upload it’s New Years Eve photos before the following weekend. 

Scott, the 23 year old manager who is also an entrepreneur said “1 star Facebook reviews started coming in along with abusive messages and the crowds just boycotted us”. 

One review on the club’s Facebook post read “can’t believe last weekend’s pics still aren’t up! How am I supposed to gram the pic i got. The photo guy had to re-take it 3 times of me and my friend. #noton #nevergoingback!”. 

A message from Corey in the clubs inbox read “were the fuk r the photos from sat nite ?!” while Dan posted a public outcry to the clubs FB page saying “im from bracken ridge, usualy we just go 2 the local but decided too treet myself and the boys on sat…. Where r the pics ????” 

After the public rage ensued the clubs owner thought it be best that from a financial perspective, the club shut down. The club’s Facebook page now has a no star rating and sits with a measly half a star rating on google reviews. 

A spokesperson for the Brisbane city council said “it’s no surprise the club had to shut down, it’s the digital age and patrons want their memories”. 

When asked if they thought it was an overreaction, the spokesperson responded “no i don’t think so, I mean attendee’s want proof of their wild drug and alcohol fueled night! The club has an obligation to provide that”.

Study reveals Brisbanese people more likely to clean windows with the Courier-Mail than read it

TEXT:

A study commissioned by the CSIRO has found that most editions of the Courier-Mail sold in the Brisbane metro area are used to clean windows and barbeques.

In addition to their use as a cleaning aid, the fledgeling newspaper is also more likely to be used to wrap up fish and chips at a takeaway than be read.

“It’s a startling statistic,” said lead research Anita Fellation. “The press is the fourth pillar of democracy, it’s a completely necessary part of a healthy society.”

“What we have here is that Queenslanders aren’t digesting enough news, they’re just using it to clean shit and wrap up deep-fried foods.”

However, The Advocate reached out to representatives from News Corp for comment, who then explained that they’re not-too-concerned about the study’s findings – explaining that as long as they’re selling newspapers, they’re happy.

As Fairfax doesn’t publish an in-print newspaper in the River City, the Courier-Mail stands alone as the apex physical media predator, all but safeguarding their operation from collapse.

“Even if Fairfax had a newspaper up here, more people would buy ours to clean their windows and BBQs,” said a News spokesman.

“Fairfax is completely cooked. They’ll disappear up their own arse within five years, mark my words. The Mail is published on a high-quality 100% recycled paper and the Herald and Age are propped up by Domain. If you tried to clean a window with the Herald, it’d fall to bits in seconds.”

“I’ll tell you what the Brisbane Times can do, they can take their pinko loony left anti-Bjelke-Petersen gutter journalism and shove it right up their arse.”

The Advocate contacted the Brisbane Times for comment, but have yet to receive a reply.

Barnaby Recoils In Horror As Mooloolaba Bartender Mixes His Rum & Coke With Havana Club

TEXT:

Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce has been left speechless by the actions of a 27-year-old backpacker currently working behind the bar at the Mooloolaba Surf Club.

It is believed the Brazilian hospitality professional, who goes by the name of Marcelo, failed to inform Mr Joyce that the house rum was actually the Cuban brand of Havana Club, before mixing him up a rum and coke.

Created in Cuba in 1934, Havana Club now one of the best-selling ‘house rum’ brands in the world, the brand was nationalised after the Cuban Revolution of 1959 and is now what Australian people try to sell in their pubs when they are cheapskates that want to appear more worldly.

Mr Joyce, who was expecting a standard seven glass with Bundaberg Rum (more commonly known as Sugarcane Champagne), was horrified to see his favourite sessionable beverage tainted by the Caribbean dark spirit.

“What is wrong with you?” he whispers.

“You monster”

The entire surf club goes silent as the second most powerful politician in Australia’s eye begin to well up.

“What is wrong with the world?” he asks.

“Where’s the bundy? What’s going on?”

“I only get one holiday a year. You’ve ruined it. I’ve been dreaming about Mooloolaba for months and you’ve ruined it”

Mr Joyce was then tended to by the surf club manager who reached to the top shelf to retrieve the Australian-made rum and coke. It is believed that the validility of Marcelo’s 457 visa is now in question.

Kiwi Bloke Pumped To Fire Off Some Agitating Rugby Stats At Aussie In-Laws This Xmas

TEXT:

As the only 130 kilogram black man in his wife’s entire extended family, local Kiwi, AJ Lepepe knows he’s already going to have a polarising presence at their annual boozy Christmas lunch next week. That’s the way he likes it.

He says he loves standing out, especially when it comes to talking about things that Aussies don’t like to talk about. The success of the New Zealand All Blacks.

“They are good people. They love me like one of their own, but they are such staunch Wallabies fans. It’s an annual blow up that we can’t avoid”

“Its the All Blacks. They can’t handle it… Which I love. I could be as pale as Rachel’s cousins from Tassie and they still would tell me to fuck off back to New Zealand”

AJ’s brother-in-law, Jim, says his daughter’s husband is a good bloke but when it comes to rugby he’s just another fucking loudmouth Kiwi.

“It drives me fucking mad. He knows that too,”

“I’d have a bit less of an issue with it if I had any ground to stand on, as a Wallabies supporter, but I don’t. He just lays it on”

Last Christmas it was believed AJ and Rachel’s cousins from Toowoomba argued about Richie McCaws unorthodox manner of talking to referees for a record of five-and-a-half hours in the pool shed while chain-smoking cigarettes.

“It doesn’t matter what you think” roared AJ.

“Look at the stats!”

“Unbeaten at eden park since 1994!”

AJ says this Christmas he’s got some very niche, but undeniably impressive stats to rattle around.

“First rugby championship going 6 from 6 bonus point victories in 2016” he says with a smile.

“This is gonna be so fucking good”

Bryce reckons the man in question, Andy (22) is fucking suss.

Bryce has put it down to the fact that Andy is either one of ‘those happy clapper types’ or something much worse. A sexual offender.

“Mate. I’m just saying”

“A bloke of that age, keeping his nose clean, not rocking the boat any way, shape or form. It’s fucking suss”

“I know it’s a horrible thing to suggest but the bloke has got some mad eyes on him”

Flume’s Sydney Concert Held Up Waiting For Mum To Drop Off Spare USB From Newport

TEXT:

It was panic stations in the high-rises and harbour-side mansions of Flumes management team recently as word spread that Flume, just hours before the first leg of his national tour, had left his USB stick at home.

Tour promoter Jo ‘Money’ Baggs expressed his anger in an unofficial statement recently.

“He has two fucking jobs to do, keep his hair looking great and bring his USB stick. We do everything else. We supply the laptop and the pretend cardboard drum machines and stuff, we even supply a personal trainer to warm up his neck for when he does his little head bobs.”

A bashful Flume (real name Harley Raudonikis) said he “just forgot”.

“There’s always a long list of things to remember to take on tour. Phone, charger, brille cream, condoms. You always forget something. This time it just happened to be the whole show”.

“These predatory A&R blokes can shut the hell up. I’ll do the best I can and bring them along for the ride, if they are lucky”

“I produced the fucking thing. It’s all good to talk up how easy everything is from the head office, these blokes make a heap of coin and all they have to do is make sure I’m alive?”

All was not lost though. In a stroke of luck, Flumes mother, Nellie, had just finished a basic computers course at the Cremorne library and was well equipped to take action when the distress call came through.

“Yeah, Harls rang and I could hear they were really stressing out about it. He had the set saved on his desktop under HarlsRoolz.mp3 so he guided me through the process of emailing it to Jo, who’s laptop he uses on the stage”

Asked if he had learned his lesson, Flume insisted, “it won’t happen again. It’s in the cloud now anyway, so as long as we have access to 3G or higher on site, I’m safe”.

You can still catch Flume on his current national tour now (except regional shows).

Nation’s Hipsters Glad C.U.B Boycott Is Over, Can Now Return To Drinking Awful Beer

TEXT:

Following a monumental win for for workers rights, the unions have today called for “an immediate end” to an ongoing boycott of Carlton United Brewers beer and cider products

Earlier this year, thousands of people rallied in support of the workers, who fell under the controversial Catalyst Services Enterprise Agreement 2014, which was rolled out at CUB’s Abbotsford plant in Melbourne.

Local hipster, Banjo Clementè says he started drinking VB and Melbourne Bitter several years ago, after CUB went undercover to win the 2014 Surry Hills Craft Beer Award – and he’s excited the boycott is over.

“I guess that whole working class theme really worked for me back then. I was going through a bit of an Auscore phase”

“But then I was put between a rock and hard place when it came down to actually supporting the working class”

“It’s like, I like drinking working class beers and I wasn’t overly interested in joining in on the boycott just because a few people got sacked. Anyway I had a few friends joining in on the boycott so I thought I’d tag along”

Last month it was reported that Australian hipsters were torn between joining the boycott and drinking Melbourne Bitter ironically. As many felt their duty to working class Australia only really extended to drinking the same beer as they do.

Banjo says he is very relieved to hear the boycott is over and can’t wait to get stuck into a low-quality, mass-produced ‘longie’ of beer.

“The moment mum puts some money into my account this afternoon, I’ll be buying a full slab of Melbourne Bitter”

Danny Green Calls Out ‘Cocky’ Kangaroo From Viral Video

TEXT:

The patron saint of being able to punch someone in the face with class, Perth boxer Danny Green, has today called out a cocky Kangaroo who has made international headlines this week after being punched in the face in a viral hunting video.

The 4-year-old kangaroo, who goes by the name of Quentin, has been accused by Green of being a ‘show pony’ who ‘bullies’ those that are smaller than him.

“I just don’t think this bloke should be given any airtime” said Green.

“I’d gladly throw on the gloves and punch on with the bloke. Pick a date”

“We can do it on pay-per-view in a really obscure location like Adelaide and make people say discriminating things on the internet to help promote it”

Overnight, the footage of zookeeper Greig Tonkins went viral after he was filmed punching the kangaroo that put his hunting dog Max in a vicious headlock.

Green has rushed to the defence of Tonkins, and said he’s willing to use his ability to fight people as a vehicle for not only making money but also furthering his career, while at the same time teaching people the respect that should be shown towards fighting.

“He might have to come down to my weight. But yeah, I’ll gladly fight him”

Report Finds 70% Of Blokes Who Pass Out At House Parties Are Uninvited Strangers

TEXT:

A recent survey by the CSIRO has found that 70% of the people who drink until they are not conscious at Australian house parties, are the type of people who came with another group and no one really knows who they are.

Proffesor Lote Meninga, from the Queensland laboratory says it’s an obscure phenomenon, but one that reoccurs right around the world.

“More often than not, if you are the type of bloke who passes out in plain sight of everyone because you’ve drunk too much and eaten to little, it’s because not many people know you at the party and therefore don’t know what to do with you”

Local passed out guy (maybe named Ben?) says he was exactly that on the weekend.

“I didn’t really know too many people at the house party so I just kept drinking because it was the easiest thing to do. I just needed to look preoccupied”

“All of a sudden someone handed me a joint, I think, and the rest is history”

“I dunno, maybe I just drank too much”

“Either way I’m glad I don’t know any of them and never have to see any of them again”

John Howard Apprehended Outside Peter Dutton’s Office Attempting To Save LNP

TEXT:

Former Prime Minister John Howard has been apprehended by security guards outside of Peter Dutton MP’s electoral office this morning, as he attempted to save the great legacy of the Liberal National Party.

The 77-year-old Order Of Australia recipient appeared to show complete disregard for the for the strict gun laws he implemented in 1997, as he blatantly waved a loaded glock 23 and called for the Minister Of Immigration to ‘come out and play-eh-ay”.

Howard was quickly apprehended by Dutton’s security detail, who rushed to diffuse the elderly statesmen.

“Let me at him!” he spat.

“You be apologising to Fraser in person when I’m done with you!”

Howard made headlines earlier this week after he rushed to the defence of his predecessor and recently deceased former LNP leader, Malcolm Fraser, following comments made by Peter Dutton that the Fraser Government was responsible for creating terrorism in Australia.

Immigration Minister Peter Dutton has stood by comments suggesting it was a mistake to resettle migrants in Australia in the 1980s, claiming he spoke the truth and would not be intimidated.

Mr Dutton singled out the community during a debate on Immigration in Parliament earlier this week, saying many people charged with terror-related offences came from that background.

However, on Wednesday, John Howard came out swinging in response to Dutton’s comments. Stating that Dutton was quite simply overlooking the fact that multiculturalism has only benefitted Australian society, and that the Minister For Immigration was grossly under-qualified for such an important cabinet role.

Howard said Dutton’s comments about his political mentor and LNP predecessor Malcolm Fraser’s immigration policies are pretty typical of someone who has only ever worked as a cop in Brisbane.

“Does that bloke even remember watching Hazim El Masri play football? He was called El Magic for a reason. Mr Fraser’s immigrations policies were ahead of their time”.

John Howard was last seen drinking a dark beverage at the Bracken Hill ‘rum jungle’ – after being removed from the scene.

Bulimba Woman Treated For Stress After Backing Range Rover Into Daughter’s VW Golf

TEXT:

A south-east Brisbane mother of three is been treated for stress this afternoon, following an embarrassing school-pick-up-time incident.

Ashley Quirk-Whitely was pulled from her precariously positioned Range Rover Sport by emergency crews, after the full-time-stay-at-home-mum accidentally reversed her suburban utility vehicle over the front of her teenage daughter’s soon-to-be first car, a Volkswagen Golf

It is believed she was stuck for up to 15 minutes until help arrived.

Emergency respondent Sam Cranstoun, who was first on the scene, said the incident comes as a warning for mothers all around the country, as we head into the long lunch months.

“Obviously people in this area don’t get breathalized so there’s no way of telling what her blood alcohol level was – but part of me thinks rosè could have played a big part in this”

Cranstoun says he was able to treat the ‘rattled and hysterical’ wife of a JP Morgan executive quite efficiently after checking her vital signs.

“I just saw the Camilla dress and the raw squeeze juice sitting in the car drink holder. I knew I’d be able to find some Valium above the fridge,”

“I had her settled in a few minutes, while we figured out where the husband was”

Ashley’s husband, John, was contacted immediately, but was unfortunately unable to hear what was happening through the roaring ambience of the Queensland Rowers Club – where he had been attending a rugby Old Boys event.

It is believed his mother was then contacted to pick this kids and take them back to her house in Adelaide East Street, Ascot.

The greater Bulimba community has rallied around Ashley this evening, with close friends booking a table at the Oxford Street Jetty bar for a few mojitos.

Report: Taking Photos Of Supermoon Not As Fun As Eating One

TEXT:

Despite the fact that Australians have flooded social media with their photos of last night’s astronomical supermoon, a report has found that most of them would have had less fun than someone who ingested an ecstasy tablet of the same name.

Last night, the full moon was 14 per cent bigger and 30 per cent brighter than normal due to the fact that it is 30,000 kilometres closer to earth than usual, or some shit.

Incredible shots from around the country show it rising over Brisbane and the Sydney Opera House. Others have captured the moon in all its glory in major cities from New York to Hong Kong and Beijing.

However, a CSIRO report has found that the variation of ecstacy also known as a ‘supermoon’ is much more fun. In fact, it’s the best way to see outer space.

Professor Shane Berrigan says that most people would find a giant photo of the moon ‘kind of fun’ but cutting shapes to electronic dance music while on ‘uppers’ would be better.

“We aren’t saying the two are mutually conclusive. I’m sure there were a few people out there that enjoyed both types of supermoon at the same time”

“But, individually, I would say that the bikie-grade ecstacy tablet is much more fun. As a rule”

“Nature and shit seems kind of fun but you tend to get bored of it pretty quickly. Pingers last a lot longer”

Instagram Model Shocked That Followers Don’t Care About Her Opinion On World Politics

TEXT:

The repercussions of a Trump victory may end up running much deeper into society than experts have first predicted.

In less than 6 months since the “Trump-slide”, Instagram models around the world are reporting record crashes in their follower numbers – as they insist on broadcasting their political views on a channel usually dedicated to photos of themselves not wearing clothes.

Alexis Rose, a 22 year old model is bewildered by the response from her fan base.

“I mean, I know they like the bikini shots and the gym workouts that I post, but I’m shocked to find that they are not at all interested in the sad pout selfie that I posted after hearing that Hillary had lost”.

Despite admitting that she knows nothing about “politics and all that stuff” she felt that her network of like-minded models owed it to their country and their fan base to “bring awareness to important topics”.

Meanwhile in the Eastern Suburbs of Sydney where a large majority of the Insta-model economy stems, young men are showing their disgust at this new content pillar coming from their favourite models on Instagram.

Stephen Barkeley, a 32 year old investment banker says “Mate, my Instagram feed is like a fucking morgue and as such, my Whatsapp threads are suffering. It’s a disaster”.

Stephen says that he and his friends are meeting at the Bucket List this afternoon to talk it through and hopefully find some “real life tail” to take their minds off this tragedy.

Exhausted Live Band Forced To Sing 8th Consecutive Rendition Of ‘The Horses’

TEXT:

A weary and dehydrated pub rock band in South Betoota have been forced to sing eight covers of the same Daryl Braithwaite song in a row, it has been confirmed.

The local musical outfit by the name of ‘Silverhair’ is made up of several middle-aged schoolteachers and a landscaper. They have been told by members of the crowd that – if they don’t do as they are told – they will be pelted with glass bottles and bar stools, as the post-Melbourne Cup celebrations reach nightfall.

“The Horses” – a song first recorded by American musician Rickie Lee Jones in 1989, entered Australian folklore when it was covered by former-Sherbet frontman, Daryl Braithwaite, on his 1990 album Rise. Braithwaite’s rendition was later featured on the 1996 Tom Cruise film, Jerry McGuire.

After reaching No. 1 on the domestic charts, “The Horses” was certified platinum in Australia by ARIA and often experiences an annual resurgence in popularity during the Australian Spring Carnival, a thoroughbred horse racing series held annually during October and November.

While the unruly crowd at the Lord Betoota Hotel shows no sign of allowing the part-time musicians off the stage anytime soon, the venue manager says it’s really up to the band to tucker them out.

“This isn’t going to end well for them if they don’t do what they are told” he says.

“If it was any other night I’d just turn on the fire hose and clear the floor, but the TAB is still running hot and the kitchen is making a motza”

“I don’t know if I have any Indian heritage or not, but I ordered this feather head piece online a few months ago and I can really feel a fire of culture burning inside me when I wear it,”

By that, ‘Greeny’ means he enjoys doing ecstasy, and plans on doing heaps of ecstacy, appropriating American Indian culture all Summer, and really letting Instagram know about it.

When asked about his thoughts on the thousands of Native Americans camping out in North Dakota since 2015 to protest against a pipeline that is meant to cross sacred burial grounds, ‘Greeny’ says he’s not that interested in politics.

Uncomfortably Pregnant Millenial Says The Instagram Post Will Be Worth It

TEXT:

Pregnant Betoota woman, Danielle Brown has a lot to look forward to in the next few months. However, not least her highest-performing Instagram photo of all time, which should be due in about four months.

“I’ve limited myself to a few nesting photos, baby clothes, that kind of stuff,” she says

“I haven’t even dropped a photo of the ultrasound. I’m waiting for the big hitter. The 200-liker,”

The ‘big-hitter’ that Danielle talks of is the standard post-birth-cradling-photo of her with her newborn child.

“I don’t even know if I want Jase [husband] in it. It’s kind of been something I’ve been looking forward to while he’s been at work,”

Danielle now has the painstaking task of making sure she doesn’t jump the gun.

“No one knows the gender yet, except the people I speak to in real life – and there’s only about 30 or 40 of them,”

“I just want to play this right. One of my friends from school managed to rack up 150 likes on a photo of her with her recently deceased grandpa. I plan on knocking her off with ease.”

ABS Chief Blames Census Crash On His Bloody Kids Downloading Viruses On Family Desktop

TEXT:

Chief statistician of the Australian Bureau Of Statistics, David Kalisch, has told the Senate that the denial of service attacks on the census website were a result of his bloody kids downloading shit on the family desktop computer.

“Don’t blame me, blame my bloody kids,” he said.

“They know I need to use that computer for work and they are on the thing every night with their bloody War Of Worldcraft!”

Prior to the monumental failure that was the 2016 Cenus, it is believed that the ABS had asked the multinational technology company, IBM, to prevent any malicious online attacks or overloading throughout the course of the evening.

However, like most Government Departments, the ABS made an executive decision to not take the internet too seriously by haggling down the cost of the contract and leaving themselves at risk.

“Those kids are on there with their bloody Napster and Grand Theft Auto. They are downloading viruses all the time!”

The fact that the Kalisch family computers also doubles as the mainframe system for the Government department of which he oversees, was brought into question during the inquiry, however he simply shrugged it off by stating “We haven’t been using computers for very long”.

“I told them all we needed was some bloody pencils and a few dead trees. This bloody internet I tell ya,”

Local Millennial Experiencing Unimaginable Financial Security After Quitting Smashed Av

TEXT:

Local millennial, Toby Campbell (24) says he can’t believe he’s spent so long blowing his income on vegetables and bread.

After giving up smashed avocado for an entire year, Toby says he can now afford things that he never would have dreamed of.

“It’s amazing. I now own an iPhone”

“Who would have known all I had to do was stop spending money on smashed av on toast. I used to eat that stuff a couple times a week because it was the only was I could console myself over the fact that I’m a member of the first generation in Western history that will live to see less than my parents,”

Campbell’s comments follow the now controversial article by Bernard Salt which suggested that the difference between baby boomers and Gen-Y was the fact that the older generations spent their youth focusing more on long term investments, such as the property, as opposed to spending ‘$22’ on smashed avocado with crumbled feta on five-grain toasted bread.

Toby says he 100% agrees.

“Look, I’m well aware that compared to 1985, the wages of a typical 50-something have grown by 34%. But the wages of a typical 20-something have only grown by 7%”

“I can also acknowledge that in the exact same period, the comparative amount of income you need to earn in order to buy a house has more than doubled…”

“But who would have known that I’d be able to catch up with the contemporary idea of the Australian dream by simply cutting back on the avocado on toast,”

Toby says now all he needs to do now is tie up a few loose ends when it comes to superannuation and health insurance. Much like the housing market, he feels this is something our generation need to be aware of.

“Now all I need to do is find a decent health insurer who won’t sting me with loading because I am outside the generation of law makers and CEO’s who legislate for themselves,”

“I’m thinking of splitting a good health plan with a couple of mates, like our generation does with rental properties. OurGo.co are offering some great deals on group-buying for health insurance,”

“Maybe I’ll be able to have kids by the time I’m 40”

Promising year 12 student, Keira Birley (17) has just realised that her preparation for the Higher Schooling Certificate has been insufficient.

While sitting before the examination paper in her high school gymnasium, she realises that her natural intelligence, charisma and work ethic is not going to be enough for her to go to university.

One hour in, a nervous mind-blank has left her frozen. While she doesn’t know it yet, her plans of being the first member of her family to attend university have just flown out the window.

Like most teenagers, Keira’s transition into adulthood has been a complex process bound with new discoveries and huge academic workload.

Unfortunately, her delightful presence and ‘bright spark’ isn’t going to be well translated though 34 pages of state-issued examination material.

Unbeknownst to Keira, in 18 month time she will be working the pole in a working class strip club in the outskirts of Newcastle.

Hundreds Of Beautiful Women Line Up To Buy Tickets For Australia’s Most Ordinary Rig Gala

TEXT:

After scouring the country for Australia’s most Ordinary Rig, swimwear brand Budgy Smuggler has proven that the husky gent is far more romantically attractive than the Wahlberg-esque Calvin Klein model.

Hundreds of beautiful women have camped out overnight to get their hands on the 2nd release of tickets to Australia’s first ever supersize male runway show, to be hosted at the Ivy Pool this weekend.

“The moment I saw those big units on the Today Show, I thought… There’s no way I am missing this” said one beautiful woman, by the name of Sandra Verone.

“The husk, the pale white skin, the heavy breathing. I love a voluptuous man,”

Another beautiful woman, who was about 20 places behind Sandra in the line, says she hopes the tickets don’t all sell out.

“Goddammit. This is so stressful. My friends and I have been out here all night,”

“The Dadbod. It does things for me,”

Hosted by Betoota’s very own Clancy Overell and Errol Parker, the runway gala will showcase iconic swimwear brand Budgy Smuggler’s effort over the last few months, as they worked to find and name Australia’s Most Ordinary Rig.

The ten finalists will be trotted out across the Ivy Pool in a similar fashion to a Victoria Secret’s fashion show. Only this time, we will be celebrating their ordinariness.

“I’m very honoured to be listed as one of the ten Budgy Smuggler fallen angels says finalist Mignon Findlay.

“I’ve worked hard for this,”

This coveted title will see the winner win 10 pairs of custom smugglers with pictures of themselves across the smugglers and the title of Australia’s Most Ordinary Rig.

Local Jet-Ski Owner Thinks It Would Be Funny If Trump Became President

TEXT:

Local jet-ski owner, Bryden Foreman (38) says the next four weeks are going to be so fucking classic.

As a father of three in Sydney’s North-Western suburbs, Bryden doesn’t think there is much chance that the imminent presidential election will affect him that much, which is why he thinks it would be so funny if Donald Trump wins.

“It’d definitely make the news more interesting,” he said.

“It’d be like WWE every time we tune in [laughter]”

Bryden, like many other comfortable suburban Australians, thinks politics is boring and usually votes in accordance with what he learns on Sunrise and through the opinion collumns in the Daily Telegraph.

“I don’t get too far into the paper,” he says.

“I usually read it from the back and by the time I’ve read what Andrew [Bolt] and Miranda [Devine] have said I’m pretty much over it,”

“It seems everyone is picking on Trump because he’s not a proper politician,”

“Personally I think it would so fucking funny if he won.”

NRL Bows To Pressure From Sharks Fans, Will Serve ‘Monster & Vodka’ At Grand Final

TEXT:

The National Rugby League has today crumbled amid mounting pressure from both the Cronulla Sharks FC and their fans, announcing that ANZ Stadium will be serving a special edition ‘Shark Juice’ on Sunday’s Grand Final against the Melbourne Storm.

The demands were made earlier in the year during Cronulla’s marathon 16-match undefeated streak when club executives requested that the NRL do their part to making Sutherland Shire residents feel comfortable while attending games outside of Shark Park.

Cronulla captain, Paul Gallen, says the team was happy to learn that their fans will be catered to on Sunday.

“Monster and vodka is a staple part of the unique Cronulla cuisine,”

“That, and the curried mince pie sandwich at Magda’s fish and chips,”

On Monday this week is was announced that Cronulla locals were starting to get their heads around the idea of multiculturalism, following the stand out performances of non-Anglo-Saxon footballers in their beloved football club.

“I never thought I’d say this. But I think Cronulla has benefited greatly from the riches of multiculturalism” said one local, Sharryd Clayne.

“I also never thought I’d see my boys in an NRL Grand Final… so… First time for everything I guess”

Local Kid Spins Pretty Crook Yarn About Marilyn Manson’s Rib Cage

TEXT:

Local kid, Alex Simons (8) has just come back from a family holiday at Noosa with some really edgy rumours.

While hanging out with some kids of the same age that he met on the beach, Alex was informed of the international schoolyard urban myth about the American musician, Marilyn Manson.

According to these random kids from Queensland, the 47-year-old Industrial Rock/Heavy Metal musician once had two of his own ribs surgically removed so that he would be able to suck his own dick.

“Its true,” he says.

“These kids told me in Noosa,”

Marilyn Manson (Brian Hugh Warner) is an American singer, songwriter, musician, composer, actor and former music journalist. He is known for his controversial stage personality and image as the lead singer of the band Marilyn Manson, which is a stage name that was formed by juxtaposing the names of two opposing American pop cultural icons; actress Marilyn Monroe and cult leader Charles Manson.

The urban myth that Marilyn Manson has had two ribs removed so that he could suck his own dick has been alive and strong in schoolyards for many decades now, and despite the rockstar denying this rumour many times over – it is still alive and strong.

“He also eats puppies on stage,” says Alex.

“He skins them first and then eats them. He also ate a bat,”

However, after a long career dedicated to confusing and intimidating the middle classes of the Western World, Marilyn Manson has no option other than to just let these rumours continue, as it is completely his fault for pushing his alter-ego to the point where people would actually believe it.

“Yeah, it’s all my fault,” he says.

“Kids were saying this two-ribs thing before the internet even came around. It’s probably one of the most generally accepted made-up stories in the world.”

“It’s probably what I’m going to be remembered for. It’s still roaring through the schoolyards to this day.”

Man, 45, In Stable Condition After Midlife Crisis Lands Him In Hospital

TEXT:

A local father of three is in hospital today with two broken fingers, a fracturing a hip and a severe concussion after a midlife crisis left him for dead on a suburban embankment.

Andrew Loughton (45) was found by a bushwalker, head-to-toe in Lycra at around 8:00am this morning.

“He looked like he had been trying to fill a void left in his life after having a family” said the bushwalker, Dave.

“I knew once I saw him face down, covered in grazes and lycra, that this was a result of a transition of identity and self-confidence,”

“That and the looming mortality that men struggle with in their mid-to-late forties,”

Loughton’s brand new Cannondale bike was also found at the scene, several metres away and on the other side of a guard rail.

A paramedic on the scene described what he saw as a first respondent.

“It was a very unfortunate sight,” he said.

“We found a man who’s wife hasn’t let him go to the pub in three years,”

“It’s hard to tell this early but I would say it’s safe to assume that he only has daughters… With one that is approaching puberty and can basically only communicate through passive sarcasm.”

It is reported that Loughton is currently on the mend at the Betoota Royal Hospital, with his wife already sending him text messages explaining why this whole bicycle thing was a fucking stupid idea from the start.

Thousands Of Disengaged Adult Sons Rush To Buy Dad The Betoota Book For Christmas

TEXT:

With over 60,000 units of The Betoota Advocate’s new book sold in just 48 hours, the race is on for thousands of disengaged adult sons across the nation to secure their copy of a book that has just enough swearing in it to make Dad laugh no matter what.

The Betoota Advocate’s first ever venture into the world of publishing has been a red hot success, topping both Peter Stefanovic and Andy Lee’s respective book sales in just two days.

Local disengaged adult son, Jackson Brutley (28) says this is the perfect gift for Dad, and that he imagines it is the type of book he will interrupt plenty of dinner parties to go and find when he can’t remember the end of a story.

“My old man loves sport, hates all levels of government and would be considered very political incorrect by Guardian readers,” he says, while emptying his cart on the ABC Books online store.

“I’m just never at home enough these days to keep up with his prejudices and sporting alliances. I think this book will have me covered,”

The book has also been wildly popular with a different demographic entirely, girlfriends who look at their phones heaps.

Local boyfriend, Dennis Gerrard (27) says he can’t wait to gift his girlfriend easily digestible online content, in print.

“It’s the type of thing we can look at together. She hates me looking over her shoulder when she’s reading Betoota yarns on her phone, so I thought I’d just buy the shit in A4 size.”

Touted as a collection of the best stories ever written, plus a host of new material from Australia’s oldest newspaper ‘The Betoota Advocate Round-Up’ has been at the centre of plenty of legal issues in the process of getting this thing on the shelves.

Local Hillsong church leader, Peter File, says this book would make a terrific present for anyone living in sin, or anyone who lacks any moral fibre. He has told us that we will be hearing from well-paid lawyers very shortly.

Staff Drinks Ruined By Hipster Intern’s Revolting Craft Beer Selection

After just 35 minutes in the pub, every person sitting at the table reserved for Out-Bush magazine’s quarterly staff drinks have decided to pack in.

With what looked to be an endless bar tab and a good crowd solid drinkers and – Managing Director, Ben Bridle, can’t understand what went wrong.

“I’d been down the street buying a pack of smokes,”

“By the time I rushed back… I only caught the last of them. I thought we were gonna turn on one. I was paying for everything.”

By the time Mr Bridle had returned from the local convenience store he, just about everyone in the office had left the table – leaving only the newly appointed unpaid intern and Sarah from HR.

“Sarah had a very serious look on her face and the Jacob [intern] looked like he was about to cry,” said Bridle.

“Turns out he’s fucked everything up after buying the first round. I should have known that he wasn’t mature enough to handle the company card,”

It is believed that Jacob the intern (19) was met with severe hostility and disgust by the rest of the office after he decided to buy 12 x pints of Phantom Brewers Passionfruit Lager.

“I had to file and incident report with HR. The kid got a very serious warning about forcing personal beliefs onto other staff members.” said a cranky Bridle, who was ready to really turn one on.

“Fuck it, I might go ahead and fire the little prick,”

“It’s just not acceptable. I should have left the card with Kev from accounts – he knows a real beer.”

Pack of feral pigs descend upon local Sizzler

TEXT:

CHAOS REIGNED AS THREE wild beasts burst through the door of their local Sizzler restaurant in Brisbane’s north this afternoon, wanting nothing more than to loosen their belts and get full.

Leaving no stone unturned, the trio meticulously pillaged each buffet in a systematic, yet utterly gluttonous act of greed. Early estimates suggest that the famous Queensland cafeteria chain may have recorded their first net loss on their famous all you can eat option.

Police and rangers from the National Parks and Wildlife are confident that close to 11 kilogrammes of hearty potato bake went missing this afternoon, which has left many in the animal control and public safety industry scratching their heads.

“That’s a lot of potato bake,” said wildlife officer Michael Concubine.

“The most disturbing thing is that Sizzler potato bake is traditionally a side dish. What kind of animal has a side dish as a main? The answer is a wild pig. One staff member is receiving counselling after she saw one of the animals turning his bowl of green jelly back into a liquid form with a fork, so it’d slide down his gullet easier,”

“The salad bar was also the subject of their interests, nearly four kilograms of avocado rocket salad has gone walkabout. In all my years as a wildlife officer, I never thought I’d see such piggery.” he said.

Other witnesses to the event explained to The Advocate that not only was their behaviour crass and vulgar, so too was their language.

One of the pigs at the centre of the controversy allegedly slammed his fists down on the table after he’d had ample sufficency, shouting, “I’m as full as mum on Father’s Day, let’s get out of this cunt hole,” which shocked and mortified other diners.

Do you know who these feral pigs belong to?

Daily Telegraph To Introduce Colour-In Front Pages

TEXT:

FROM EARLY NEXT YEAR, Sydney’s Daily Telegraph will begin to roll out colour-in front pages in a bid to increase its circulation ‘now and into the future’.

A News Corp spokesman made the announcement today in light of many of the paper’s competitors releasing statements in recent months that outline their plans to slash jobs and maximise savings.

“It truly is a great time for journalism, this is the digital golden age,” he said.

“That’s why we’ve gone with colour-in front pages. We want to secure Telegraph readers at a young age and there’s no better way into a child’s mind than through a coloured pencil. The Telegraph already puts a number of Disney characters on the front page, so we thought we’d tie these ends together,”

“There are plans to introduce a digital colour-in front page, but that’s still some time away. For now, these innovative new designs should begin appearing in newsracks by summer’s end.”

However, not everybody is pleased with this controversial step taken by News Corp to lure in young readers.

Both the nation’s young news junkies and borderline illiterate are up in arms over the measures, with both groups voicing their concerns.

“Some of us would prefer to colour-in the Sydney Morning Herald, because we don’t want this fascist vitriol rammed down our throats over breakfast,” said 7-year-old Alison Duggan.

“And I don’t want to keep colouring Bill Shorten’s dumb head in for the next three years,” she said.

On the other hand, simple trench digger Nathan Frog said the new designs look too complex and he’s afraid that he won’t be able to finish colouring it into his high standard with only a four-in-one Biro pen.

“It’s fucking bullshit, mate,” he said.

“How do they expect the everyday bloke to colour-in a whole front page while on the job? Do they think every bloke in the fucking town carries coloured pencils around with him? Becasue they don’t,”

“I just want a fair go.”

Young Liberal Staffer Spends $14k Of Charity Funds On Off-The-Rack Tarocash Suits

TEXT:

A young Liberal who is managing Christine Forster’s campaign to become Sydney’s next Lord Mayor had to repay almost $14,000 to his former charity employer after it was discovered he had blown the money on personal expenses through the organisation’s credit card.

Mitchell Price, who is also a senior adviser to Coogee MP Bruce Notley-Smith MP, used a corporate credit card to purchase $13,816 worth of off-the-rack Tarocash suits while employed as an executive assistant to the CEO of Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras from November 2013 to April 2015.

Speaking to The Advocate today, Mr Price said the irresponsible use of charity funding was a result of peer-pressure from his Young Liberal colleagues.

“It’s hard to work for an LGBTI charity and be a devout Young Liberal at the same time,”

“There was a lot of pressure on me to adhere to their party policies, so I did the wrong thing,”

“I spent close to $14,000 on Tarocash menswear,”

Under Section 14.D of the NSW Young Liberal membership guidelines, ‘all party members must own at least 3-4 Tarocash suits’. This is, as the handbook states ‘the unofficial dress code of the Young Liberals’ – as the twenty-something law graduates look to impress their parents by pretending they go to work each day.

Price says, as a former employee of the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras, the fact that the suits were from Tarocash hurt him the most.

“It wasn’t even that the money wasn’t mine. It was the fact that I was buying off-the-rack suits just to fit in with my precocious peers,”

“Honestly, every time I put on one of those hideous fluoro ties, I feel like I’m with all the plebs in the Rosehill General Admission,”

“But I am not a dictator, the Liberal party is very diverse and I must tow the line when it comes to party policy.” he said.

Following the incident, the Mardi Gras board cancelled all corporate credit cards and replaced them with limited debit cards to restricted accounts, and cancelled all third party transport accounts.

The emergence of Mr Price’s fall-out with the Mardi Gras organisation has come during a period of bitter infighting among inner Sydney conservatives, even as Ms Forster is poised to mount a strong challenge to Town Hall titan Clover Moore.

Ms Forster and Mr Notley-Smith both rallied behind Mr Price on Tuesday, telling Fairfax Media they accepted his explanation that the misuse of corporate funds had been the result of a mistake.

Cool mum learns how to Harambe shitpost

TEXT:

SHE’S NEW TO THE WORLD of social media, but Wanda DeFoe is an old hand at shitposting.

The 61-year-old follows her children on Instagram and sometimes they accidently send her something on Snapchat they probably shouldn’t have. When they were in school, her children didn’t have to ask her to pull up a block from their private school so their friends wouldn’t know the family drove a Tarago – she just did.

Wanda DeFoe is a cool mum.

And now she’s even cooler, as she’s joined in Harambe shitposting with her middle son Alex, a 16-year-old who communicates his mental and social problems through memes.

On May 28, 2016, a three-year-old boy trespassed in gorilla enclosure at the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden and was cradled and loved by Harambe, a 17-year-old Western lowland gorilla. Fearing for the boy’s life, a zoo worker shot and killed Harambe.

In death, Harambe has spurred on and inspired a generation of meme makers and shitposters to carry on the torch lit by the great ape.

One of those meme making shitposters is Wanda DeFoe.

“I guess I’m a lot older than most Harambe shitposters, but that doesn’t mean I don’t get the whole idea of Harambe. I think it’s funny, but sad at the same time,” she said.

“Alex and I spend hours shitposting together and we’ve definitely grown closer by grieving over Harambe’s death. I’m still learning how to meme, but I’ve done a lot of tutorials and I know how to deep fry them so they look like they’ve been through the hood,”

“I can’t wait to see what the next meme is. I loved watching Arthur with my kids back in the 90s. Also, SpongeBob was hilarious as a meme. I’ve been making a few ABBA memes before bed each night incase that takes off and I need some quick OC. Alex has told me I should start my own meme page but I don’t think I’m ready yet.”

Premier Mike Baird Describes Sam Neill As A Blashphemous Hippy Who Believes In Dinosaurs

TEXT:

Three days after Hollywood superstar Sam Neill slammed the NSW government’s “deeply regrettable” decisions to impose nightlife lock-out laws, Premier Mike Baird has responded with a vitriolic attack on the Jurassic Park actor’s “moral fibre”.

Speaking to NOVA radio in Sydney this morning, Baird fired back at Neill’s claims.

“I think it’s very rich for some two-bit creative to fly in here overnight and accuse me of negligence in my role as Premier,”

“He’s the one that has made a living out of blasphemic evolution propaganda,”

Neill’s comments came during his visit to Parramatta Park to announce the annual Tropfest film festival will move from Centennial Park to Western Sydney, the 68-year-old Kiwi said: “I’m grumpy because Sydney used to be such a vibrant and exciting place in the late ’70s and early ’80s.

“There was an extraordinary culture but the vibrancy has been sucked out of the place.”

However, Mike Baird says he won’t be made to feel guilty by a man who’s spent his life associating with homosexuals and engaging in pre-marital sex with women who live out of home.

“The very fact that this man was given a platform to make these comments is what is wrong with our media,” he said.

“We moved this feral film festival to Parramatta for a reason – and he’s used it as an opportunity to reminisce about inner-Sydney… as though it still belongs to the perverts,”

“This is a man who starred in two different films that show scientists cloning dinosaurs – and what’s worse, they suggest that this so called ‘Jurassic Period’ happened over 80 million years ago,”

“The man is morally corrupt and I have no respect for people who think the world is that old,”

Another Baird ruling that Neill chose to take aim at was the Greyhound Racing ban in NSW.

“Shutting down the dogs is a crime, it’s a valuable part of working-class culture. Film and racing and dogs are part of Australian culture.” said Neill, a comment that was also responded to by Baird.

“If this man honestly thinks my city should designate eight acres to a greyhound track, then he really is as stupid as he looks,”

“If you want to gamble, go down to the Casino – it’s just a stone’s throw from Wentworth Park anyway,”

“Or should I say, Hillsong Park”

Victorian Premier Hums Cypress Hill While Inspecting First Crop Of Legal Cannabis

TEXT:

Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews has been videotaped humming along Cypress Hill’s ‘Hits From The Bong’ while inspecting the first crop of medicinal cannabis in a secret facility.

The footage, which is the first time Premier Andrews has been ‘officially’ filmed alongside hydroponic kush since the 1970s, comes as the state’s first chair of the Independent Medical Advisory Committee for medicinal cannabis has been appointed.

Speaking to media today, Premier Andrews said it was time to introduce the new strain of ‘Andrews Haze’ to the sick boys and girls of Victoria – as well as grown men who enjoy Star Wars.

“It’s time,” he said.

“Time to pick it, pack it, fire it up and come along”

The Premier spoke of a conversation he had with a mild glaucoma patient yesterday morning who had already begun using medicinal marijuana in the lead up to the new law changes.

“Put aside the stigma, just for a second. Don’t get me wrong this is not a new method,”

“I spoke to a patient yesterday who said he loves a blunt or a big fat cone, but his double barrelled bong is getting him stoned,”

“He told me it goes down smooth when he gets a clean hit – of the skunky funky smelly green shit”

Mr Andrews said he was talking with other states about the progress and scientists were already sequencing genomes in different types of cannabis.

Mr Andrews admitted some families were at risk of breaking the law if they continued to source marijuana for their children in the interim.

Health Minister Jill Hennessey said the department was working with those families but warned there was a “legally grey area”.

Sydney Girl Still Wearing City2Surf Bib At Work In Case Coworkers Didn’t Know How Fit She Is

TEXT:

Sydney woman, Clover O’Farrell (42), is still wearing her Sun-Herald City2Surf bib despite the fact that she crossed the finish line over 24 hours ago.

The City2Surf is a popular road running event held annually in Sydney, Australia covering a 14 kilometres course. The event is a presented as a fundraiser for charity as well as a race, attracting both competitive runners and community participants who can choose to run or to walk.

The event attracts more than 80,000 entrants who start in staggered groups based on previous running times and early entry.

One of the most identifiable things about entrants is that they often spend as long as possible in their City2Surf outfits upon completion. With cafes and pubs across Sydney peppered with active-wear and body odour until at least 6pm (lock-out) each year.

As one of the tens of thousands of entrants in the iconic Sydney fun-run, Mrs O’Farrell wants you to know that she not only is the type of person who can easily abstain from alcohol for an entire weekend, but also that she is easily fit enough to complete a the 14 kilometre course from the CBD Hyde Park all the way to Bondi Beach.

She has done this by wearing her City2Surf bib for three days straight.

Co-worker Ben Thompson says he can’t wait until every one of the forty-four people in Mrs O’Farrell’s office become aware that she helped raise money for sick kids on the weekend – he believes that her incessant social media activity, non-stop references to ‘how sore’ she is and poor post-marathon personal hygeine will remain an issue until they do.

“We get it” he says.

“She wore running gear to work for three months in the lead up… I don’t know how much preparation you need for a 14 kilometre run, but she made it very clear that she was getting ready for it,”

However, Thompson says he can’t really criticise the account director’s behaviour – stating that she’s just one of many people trying to find a way to have fun in Australia’s most populated city which is currently lacking a nightlife due lock-out laws imposed by an evangelical Christian state Government.

“I can’t really talk – I drank eight bottles of red wine and did a couple class A’s at home and watched the Sydney Swans highlights”

“I guess that in 2017 Sydney, running non-stop for 14 kilometres is about as much fun as you can have in our city streets”
