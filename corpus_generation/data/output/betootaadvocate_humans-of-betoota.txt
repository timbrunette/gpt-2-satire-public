Centrelink Under Fire For Blasting ‘You Better Work Bitch’ By Britney Spears In Waiting Rooms

TEXT:

Logan Centrelink has reportedly been investigated by local authorities for blasting Britney Spears 2013 smash hit ‘Work Bitch’ in the waiting area. The initiative, spearheaded by the by the Morrison government, was being tested as a way to motivate Centrelink-dependants to ditch Newstart and ‘gain employment – an idea the government obviously thinks hasn’t occurred to any of them before.

Now, in between dropping their dacks for a piss test, recipients are awarded the privilege of hearing ‘Now get to work bitch’ on repeat.

One such person who was privy to Logan’s short-lived experiment was ex-accountant, Melanie Stewart. 

The fifty-five year mother of three had just been given the sack when she begrudgingly made her way into her local Centrelink. After navigating her way through the long line and tapping what services she needed on the prehistoric office iPad, Melanie found herself in the waiting room.

“At first I was just listening to a couple have a domestic spat,” says Melanie, “but then I heard what they were playing.”

“Honestly, it’s a new low, even for Logan.”

The Logan office had originally planned to play Dolly Parton’s ‘9 to 5’ but found that it actually had the opposite effect that they’d hoped. 

Torn between that and adding sad face emoji’s to bank statements, the government has claimed that they are trying to appeal to millennials with the princess of pop.

“We’d heard of scientists playing Mozart to rats,” says a Logan City Council member, before pausing, “I now realise that doesn’t sound too good, can you scratch that?”

This new controversy comes shortly after the robo debt scandal, which saw thousands of Australia’s most vulnerable people accused of owing money to the governemnt due to clerical errors. 

In response to the robodebt scandal, Prime Minister Morrison has reportedly announced plans to switch Britney with Rihanna’s ‘Bitch betta have my money.”

Bloke Who Got A Certainty From A Friend Of A Friend Nowhere To Be Seen After Race

TEXT:

A local man with no history of magical ability has done a Harry Houdini this afternoon after a horse he tipped to everyone he knows came last in the Cup. 

It’s believed Damien Hartnell had been spruiking a tip he received from a friend of a friend who works in the stable of the horse’s trainer.

The horse, Tim Sydney, was paying $36 for the win and anyone who can read a form guide would know that the horse’s form probably wasn’t there. 

However, it was the guarantee from Damien that made sane people go against their better judgement and back the horse.

“It was the fairytale that got me,” said one remorseful punter.

“I had $100 on the nose; $3600 I could have won”

“I’d already started spending it.”

When asked why he trusted Damien so blindly, the punter revealed that Damo [sic] often has massive wins on the punt, so he assumed this would be another one of those times.

“Every other weekend you hear about him winning thousands”

“But I suppose you never hear about the losses, do ya?”

The Advocate has attempted to contact Damien for comment however he is yet to come out of hiding.

Local Priest Unsure Where All These People With Funny Sandshoes Have Come From

TEXT:

Parish leader of Betoota Heights church, Father Patrick Reiley (68), has recently realised a strange change in his congregation and it’s not the fact that there is one to begin with.

Listen here to our interview with controversial Victorian swimmer Mack Horton; you won’t want to miss it: 

During the Sunday service at Saint Geraldine’s, Father Reiley noticed that the new worshippers had one thing in common, they were all wearing the same pair of ‘sandshoes.’ 

Following a career path wherein his footwear is hidden from public view, the priest turned to God for answers as to why the new worshippers were wearing the same shoes. God was unavailable for comment and is yet to make a public statement.

It wasn’t until the end of the service Reiley received his explanation as one of the new followers asked him why none of the hymns featured a saxophone solo or a twenty-second verse from Pusha T.

As someone who considers The Carpenters to be a bit out there, Father Reiley took some time to fully understand that US rapper Kanye West’s new gospel-inspired album is the reason these young hype beasts are in church.

“I just hope they don’t give us followers of faith a bad reputation,” stated the Catholic priest.

“Kane West [sic] is he the one who is always yelling?”

As a man who has dedicated his life trying to bring new people into his congregation, Father Reiley is satisfied that young people are showing an interest in Jesus but remains sceptical about Kanye West having an affiliation with Christianity.

“Don’t ever tell a Catholic priest there’s no such thing as bad press.”

Pork Chop Denies Carrying On

TEXT:

A meat raffle at the iconic Betoota Hotel has ended in a brawl after a Pork Chop started carrying on. 

Although accounts of the night vary due to the various amounts of alcohol consumed by those present, the Pork Chop claims he is not to blame. 

“Yeah, it’s unfair mate. Everyone goes yeah, he’s carrying on like the Pork Chop that he is but that’s actually a really offensive stereotype and there’s no need for that sort of shit in 2019.” 

Derek Ralstone, who was the bouncer on the night as part of his Year 10 Work Experience placement, said the Pork Chop really was the instigator. 

“He just wouldn’t shut up, everyone was like get over it mate, it’s just a joke but he kept saying that it was his right to make a scene and he wasn’t prepared to cool off in the coolroom.” 

However, the Pork Chop disagrees. 

“Yeah, things got pretty wild for a bit. Some guy made a pig joke, but I responded like anyone in my position would, and then it was on for young and old. I did tenderise a few blokes, that’s true, but they had it coming for sure.”

“What, don’t you believe me? Bullshit mate, I saw you smirking smartass, what’s so funny?”

“You think this shit is funny, bro? Put up or shut up mate.”

“No, fuck you I won’t calm down, I’ve had a gutful of pricks like you thinking I’m carrying on like a Pork Chop, like it’s my destiny or some shit.”

“Fuck you, bring it on! Let’s go mate. Let’s go, come on. Bring it on brother”.

Restaurant Floor Manager The Only Staff Member Paid Enough To Sing Happy Birthday To A Stranger

TEXT:

An investigation into the psychological toll of singing happy birthday to strangers has revealed some staggering results today. 

The piece, led by The Advocate, discovered that restaurant managers are the only staff members paid enough to be able to overcome the humiliation of singing to a complete stranger.

Our reporters managed to work closely with over 100 of Betoota’s top restaurants, initially interviewing each individual staff member to find out how many of them actually enjoyed singing happy birthday, but after the first few restaurants, we realised we were on to something far greater.

It was clear to see that no one enjoyed singing happy birthday, but where it became interesting was the point at which people stopped caring.

Staff members on a salary of $50,000 per year suffered the highest rate of psychological damage, whereas managers on $100,000 had little to no damage at all.

“Fuck it, I get paid pretty good, so I might as well sing” said the manager at Blue Lobster, a Japanese-French inspired restaurant in the French Quarter.

A floor runner at Tappas on Tap was not so sound, “It’s humiliating, especially if it’s a hot chick. I’m tone-deaf. I don’t sleep for 2 nights after I have to sing happy birthday.” 

According to the floor runner’s mum, his night terrors are nearly to the point that she’s considering speaking to management.

“It’s just so hard to watch. And all because they make him sing happy birthday.”

Woman Not Sure Man Is Attractive Or Just In A Position Of Power

TEXT:

Pam Jensen today started questioning her choices, after a particular incident at work left her feeling a bit hot under the collar. 

The 30-year-old legal administrator had been reprimanded by the CFO for misplacing a document, and instantly felt herself feeling more attracted to him. 

“I wasn’t really into Rob but since he got promoted he just seems different,” says Pam. 

“Maybe it’s because he’s got that whole silver fox thing going on?” 

Rob, a fifty-three-year-old father of two with a beer gut and a receding hairline, is known more for his penchant for yellow mustard ties than his charm, but Pam doesn’t seem to notice. 

“Or maybe it’s the suits,” said Pam. 

“I do love a man in a suit.” 

Pam’s long-suffering friend Laura, revealed that this isn’t the first incident she’s witnessed. 

Having known her since high school, Laura says Pam used to crush on the history teacher. 

“We went to an all-girls school so we only had one male teacher,” said Laura. 

“His name was Mr. Creeley and he had this weird hump and a bung leg. Pam thought he was cute.”

Laura says the weird crushes continued as they got older. 

“Yeah once we got pulled over for a broken taillight and Pam wouldn’t stop talking about the police officer for days. She reckons he brushed her hand on purpose when she gave him her licence.” 

“And don’t get me started about the time she got a pat-down at the airport.” 

Pam has reportedly taken a good look inwards and is making an effort not to act on her impulses. 

However, this decision comes at a time that might prove a little difficult. 

“I’ve decided to go back and finish my studies,” said Pam. 

“I’d like to get out of administration and practice law myself.” 

“It’s been a while since I’ve been to university so hopefully the professors won’t be too hard on me.”

Report: Chrysler 300C Drivers Know People Who Know People

TEXT:

All Chrysler 300C drivers probably know somebody who knows somebody, a new report has revealed. 

The report, commissioned by the Australian Federal Police, uncovered that all 300C drivers involved in the study directly or indirectly knew people who could solve certain problems, procure certain items, or even make certain people or objects disappear as required.

“What we have found is that drivers of this particular make and model of motor vehicle seem to have a wide circle of acquaintances, although they had a very poor memory when asked for more details about these particular persons of interest” explained AFP Sergeant Charles Rugburn. 

“Another interesting discovery is that the number of useful acquaintances each 300C driver knew was proportional to the retail price of the wheels fitted to the vehicle and also the darkness of the tint”. 

Although the full results of the report were not finalised after some of the statisticians overdosed on certain substances and others disappeared after asking too many questions, Rugburn explained the results could not be extrapolated to other vehicles. 

“This is a very unique situation where the results are not only not relevant to vehicles from other manufacturers, but not even relevant to other Chrysler products. Earlier studies have shown that Chrysler Voyager owners are only familiar with shitty transmission gaskets and Jeep owners are only familiar with the terms and conditions of their Warranty”

Sargeant Rugburn was unavailable for further comment as he had to take care of some “urgent family business” which appeared to be related to a note constructed from cut out newspaper letters.

Facebook Friend Debunks Climate Change With Pictures Of Garbage Left By Protesters

TEXT:

The scientific community is in turmoil today after the entire premise of climate change and global warming was totally debunked by a man with no scientific credentials.

Betoota local and noted climate change skeptic Brett Melon posted a link to a picture this morning purporting to show bins overflowing with garbage after a climate change rally. 

Although several scientists were quick to point out that what the picture actually depicted was a lack of garbage receptacles for the size of the crowd which could be interpreted as showing that support for climate change action is greater than expected and such a localised waste disposal issue was not in any way connected to the issue of climate change on a global scale, most were more pessimistic.

“I could not believe it. As soon as I saw the post, I knew all my research was for nothing because here was a clearly documented personal anecdote that the very people who were most passionate about the issue were not putting their garbage in the bin that was already full” sobbed Dr Marcel Foley, as he pushed dusty document boxes of carefully collated files out of the window of his office in the CSIRO Climate Science Centre and into the dumpster in the carpark below. 

“All those wasted years, all that carefully collated data, all those symposiums, all those peer-reviewed journal articles, all for nothing. None of it was real, we were all tricked somehow, I feel like such a fool! I mean, they weren’t even recycling bins, just regular garbage bins!”

For his part, Brett was more circumspect when he heard of the impact his simple message had caused. 

“Guess the truth hurts hey?” he grinned 

“I knew it was bullshit ages ago when they said I couldn’t just burn off shit in the back yard anymore. But I’ve been doing it for years and it’s still cold in winter so you can’t argue with proof like that”.

Local Bachelor Deep In COD Wormhole Tosses Up Between Mi Goreng And Plain Cheese Toastie

TEXT:

A
young local man was forced to make a tough choice today. 

Moulded
into his couch, deep in the middle of a Call of Duty Modern Warfare wormhole, Kyal
Hitchens had to make a decision about how he would keep his body going – and
not by draining another 500ml can of Monster energy drink. 

He
had to figure out whether to wait the two minutes it takes to boil water and
the subsequent two minutes for a packet of Mi Goreng noodles to reach a nice
level of cooked, or to wait potentially 5 minutes for a toastie to melt and the
following few minutes for that meal to cool to a point where it wouldn’t strip
the skin of the inside of his mouth like a schooner of metho. 

This
comes after his life went on hold like a call to Centrelink, since the launch
of the new Modern Warfare today, which is now set to occupy 77% of the humble
bachelor’s non-work related waking moments. 

Speaking
to The Advocate from his couch, after
he was forced to call in sick to work with a nasty unseasonal head cold, the
young Engineer who may as well flick his email to out of office for the weekend
explained that he eventually went the Mi Goreng. 

“Yeah,
thought I’d go with something with a bit of flavour, rather than just the old
plain cheese toastie dipped in tomato sauce,” he said slumped in his chair. 

“Something a bit exotic you know,” explained the young man who’s been glued to his PS4 like an exam time student to Netflix. 

“Look, the campaign has some fucking hectic moral
conundrums to play through, so I didn’t have time to think about shit like what
to eat.”

“Mi
Goreng, easy slam dunk with a nice Monster to wash it down, respawn, run and
gun, headshot, and the game goes on.” 

It’s believed Hitchens productivity at work, around the house, and on his personal hygiene will now take a hit similar to many young men and women following the release of the new Call Of Duty – with his life spiralling further and further into the B/O and energy drink smelling wormhole.  

“I’ve got a mate’s farewell and a 30th on the weekend too, so I just need to really knock this campaign on the head before then,” he said before swivelling around.

Melbourne Man Negotiates Half Price On The Lensless Frames

A Melbourne man has today proved he is more than a just a stereotype, after successfully bartering with a teenage retail assistant at the Betoota Ponds Glasses and Eye Wear.

Henry Milk-Crate (28) built up a little bit of social credit in the store by negotiating a 50% discount on a pair of Quay sunglasses – which shouldn’t actually be called sunglasses because the clear lenses offer no practical outdoor benefit.

While Milk-Crate was feeling pleased with himself for seemingly negotiating a discount on a previously full-priced item, The Advocate can reveal that the store attendant actually gave him the discount to get rid of the product.

“Yeah, no one in Betoota would buy those”

“They were sent here by accident, somehow they got Betoota and Brunswick mixed up and we got a heap of Melbourne stock”

“I’m stoked that I could get rid of them, he did me a favour.”

Milk-Crate’s presence in the town hasn’t gone unnoticed, with a number of second-hand retailers doing their best to lure the hipster into their shops.

After the airing of a documentary in the UK overnight, much has been made of a supposed falling out between Prince Harry and Prince William. 

Speaking to The Advocate today, an anonymous royal insider has explained that the dust up between the two brothers stems from the leaking of some controversial pictures. 

It’s believed that Prince William has angered his little brother by allowing his wife Kate to have a look through some of the photos he took on Harry’s bucks a little while back. 

“Harry was a bit off Will for showing some photos from his bucks where members may have been doing some typical bucks related things,” the insider said.

Local Cafe Makes Up For Lack Of WiFi With Complimentary Serving Of Lukewarm Boomer Comedy

TEXT:

Times are tough for local businesses but Flight Path District cafe Ten Sugars In has managed to cut back on spending in a way that doesn’t sacrifice humour or something close to humour.

Owner of Ten Sugars, Gary Pope (62) states that cafe goers are willing to overlook cost cutting if the venue fosters a lighthearted environment with a penchant for hacky, non-PC, boomer comedy.

Aside from serving coffee thinner than his profit margins, one way Pope has cut down on spending includes not offering complimentary customer WiFi in favour of a sign that says ‘No WiFi, talk to each other!’ as if that’s something his patrons would actually want to do.

“Don’t come here expecting to play FortCraft or whatever, come in here and have a conversation!”

An additional benefit of not offering WiFi to their customers is Pope will not have to go through the process of setting it up, a task he is about as equipped to do as he is have a conversation with someone without offending them.

Hangovers bring out the worst in people at the best of times, but one Betoota woman has shocked even the most seasoned hangover handlers this morning.

Brit Courtney (21) woke this morning with a headache that would kill a Shetland pony, but it wasn’t long before she found a slightly crook remedy to sort herself out.

Without properly opening her eyes, Courtney clumsily felt around for Panadol on her bedside table, then for some liquid to knock them back with. 

Fortunately for Courtney, her drunk self had left both in an easily accessible spot for her.

She was grateful for a second, but that was shortly replaced by disappointment. 

After swallowing the first Panadol, Courtney’s system got a rude shock.

She was then faced with a choice; does she take the second Panadol with sprite too? Or does she get up and walk 10 steps to the bathroom for water.

With little to no internal torment, Courtney completely gave up on herself and opted to down the second Panadol with the remaining Sprite. While she could have left the last mouthful of Sprite in the glass, she figured she was already at rock bottom, so what’s another mouthful?

At the time of press, Brit had rolled back over and is waiting for her scat concoction to kick in.

Absolute Psycho From High School Now A Qualified Nurse

TEXT:

Local woman Samantha Jade had been mindlessly scrolling through her Facebook when she came across some worrying photos. 

The album titled ‘Best job in the world’ had been uploaded by Betoota High’s most notorious bully and rumoured psychopath, Jessica Gibson. 

Armed with a bag full of syringes, and clad in medical garments, these posts heavily suggest that the girl once known for pushing small children into agapanthus bushes is now a qualified nurse.  

“I’m bloody shocked,” says Samantha, now trawling Jessica’s LinkedIn for confirmation, 

“She’s the last person I’d imagine in a position of care.” 

It was reported that Jessica had previously tried her hand at psychology in a bid to ‘understand herself more’ before moving into the field of nursing. 

Now in her first year of residency, Jessica is tasked with looking after some of the most vulnerable people – all while operating under four hours of sleep. 

The Advocate managed to track her down at the local Chatime, where she was recuperating from a split shift. 

“You know what, people change, okay?” says Jessica, stabbing her straw multiple times into her bubble tea, “I’m a very compassionate person and I’m great at what I do.”

It is unknown whether Jess manages a fleet of similar-minded nurses, or is a lone operator. 

What is known, however, is that Jess plans on specialising in geriatric care. 

“I was pretty close with my grandparents so I can see myself working with the elderly,” says Jess, “they’re just so cute and fragile.” 

Samantha, who was previously Jess’s favourite victim when it came to daily bouts of torment, is still in two minds about her findings. “Maybe she’s changed,” says Samantha doubtfully, “I’m still surprised though, honestly thought she’d become a cop.”

Yet Another LinkedIn Notification Reminds Woman About Her Completely Pointless Digital Footprint

TEXT:

Local woman Stacey Brice had been enjoying her day when she received a LinkedIn notification. 

Thinking someone had spied her profile, Stacey was mortified to find out that a former schoolmate had just been promoted to ‘Head Research Scientist at NASA.’ 

“Oh for Christ’s Sake”, says Stacey, spilling a half eaten 4 N Twenty pie on her shirt, “I don’t need this shit.”

Stacey had been feeling pretty good about herself lately, and was happy being a Site Supervisor for a local fit-out and construction company. 

But with this news, Stacey feels she may be underachieving. 

“Honestly I don’t even know why I have a LinkedIn profile,” says Stacey, “It’s not exactly blue collar friendly.” 

“I’m starting to think the whole premise of it is to make you feel like shit.” 

This comes after a particularly hard year filled with engagements, marriages, and newborns being flouted on Facebook, and impossible waist to butt ratios lining her Instagram feed. 

“Yeah I’m pretty over these notifications” says Stacey, “like no, I don’t want to congratulate Amy Anderson for starting a new position at Google.” 

Not keen to delete all her social media profiles just yet, Stacey has decided to instead focus on the more positive things instead. 

“I think I need to realise that for every promotion or cool new position, there’s someone getting involved in a pyramid scheme.”

Man Actually Bragging About Eating Lunch In His Car After Noble Purchase Of Meat-Free Whopper

TEXT:

A rapidly ageing mid level marketing and sales
rep for some generic company based in our town’s Old City District has had a
little win today. 

The reserve grade Dolphins backrower named
Korbin Sampson did so during his lunch break, when he treated himself to a fast
food meal he didn’t have to lie to his colleagues and girlfriend about. 

Prone to wolfing down a sneaky burger meal
deal in between jobs, where his actions can go unnoticed, Sampson today found
himself actually bragging about his lunchtime decision to try a meat-free Rebel
Whopper from Hungry Jack’s. 

Speaking to colleagues as his waltzed back
into the open plan office a short time ago, the happily engaged Betoota Heights
resident found himself walking with a spring in his step – like a 5th grade
tailender who’s just ground out a gritty 7 off 32 balls. 

“Yeah, just polished off one of those meat free burgers,” said the noble and selfless local man licking his finger and trying to rub the burger sauce out of his salmon Politix shirt. 

“Just doing my bit for the planet you know,”
explained the newly converted flexitarian. 

Receiving little to no feedback from any of
his colleagues other than a vague energyless ‘Oh yeah,’ Sampson continued. 

“Was pretty good too, and nice to go
plant-based,” explained the man now just moments away from looking online for
an electric car. 

“Only thing is, would probably be better if
they could make the Ultimate Double Whopper meat free you know?” 

“That would be the ultimate guilt free rip in
feed [haha]” 

“Nah seriously though, changing my IG bio to
‘Plant-Based Warrior’ as we speak.” 

This article is brought to you in partnership with the people that made the burger that this overgrown child is currently eating in his car  – Hungry Jacks.

iPhone Notes Mostly Made Up Of Strongly Worded Texts That Were Too Strongly Worded To Send

TEXT:

Local woman Gemma Bishop has again taken to her iPhone notes to pump out some passive-aggressive texts. 

The 25 year old Brisbanite had been feeling pretty pissed at her roommates lately, and rather than confronting them in person, has come up with some choice words to send them via Messenger. 

Though the main target of her attack is the latest roommate Corey, Gemma thought it’d be best to send a group message urging “everyone to pull their weight cleaning.”

“It’s come to my attention that some of the dishes aren’t being washed properly,” texts Gemma, “I found a fleck of carrot on one of the plates and I just don’t understand why it’s so hard for some people to clean up after themselves.”

Gemma decides that message might be a little too forward, and proceeds to start all over again. 

It’s revealed that of the 272 notes stored in her iPhone, 190 of them are strongly worded texts.

“This one was for a guy that said he wasn’t ready for a relationship,” Gemma says, revealing a text that reads like a bloody dissertation, “I accidentally sent it and he ended up blocking me.”

Gemma now writes all of her texts in her iPhone notes and has cultivated a careful screening process which involves three drafts, a run-through with Grammarly, and final approval by her best friend, Amy.“Amy has the last say,” says Gemma, “she lets me know if I’m coming across too strong.”

As per Amy’s suggestion, Gemma foregoes blasting the group message inbox and takes an alternative approach instead.

“I decided to just leave a post it note on his door. Figured that would be the more adult way to go about it.”

Mum’s Only Weekend Between Footy And Cricket Ruined By The One Couple She Loathes

TEXT:

The life of a footy mum comes second in struggle only to the life of a cricket mum with the same hat often worn by one very tired and sunburnt woman.

However, all multi-tasking mums know the glorious weekend that lies between the football and cricket seasons that gives them a chance to reflect on why they pushed their kids into sport in the first place.

Such is the case for Betoota Grove mother Angelina Whitby (49) who thought she was to spend The Golden Weekend with a rare sleep in until she heard the doorbell go off.

“I swear if it’s door knockers I’m going to give them something to forgive me for,” stated Whitby as she powered to the front door in her dressing gown.

Unfortunately for Whitby, she was met not by individuals offering God’s eternal salvation but by a local childless couple whom she loathes.

“Great to see you both!”

The couple Shawna and Ian Mateo claimed to be in the area and were stopping by to ask about the fresh coat of paint Angelina is always talking about putting on her house.

“I could hook you up with some samples from the new job,” stated Ian before going into a description of his job that makes under 16s park cricket look like The Ashes.

Not being able to simply murder the individuals that stood on her front door, Whitby told the Mateos she needed to prepare for her son’s cricket game so they would leave.

“Don’t know how you do it every weekend huh!”

Dad Reminded Of Beer Left In Freezer By Muffled Boom

TEXT:

An investigation into the strange noise recently heard coming from the kitchen has revealed the tragic loss of a bottle of beer Dad left there to quickly cool down while he mowed the lawn. 

“It’s looking like a worst case scenario at the moment”, Dad revealed at a press conference attended exclusively by Mum. 

“Although the bottle did not break, the lid itself has separated from the bottle, resulting in beer covering several trays of frozen sausages, including the really big tray from Costco. 

Whilst most of the beer remains in the bottle, it is likely that this could be regarded as a total loss because after thawing, it will probably not be drinkable due to the loss of millions of bubbles. 

Whilst the investigation is continuing, at this stage, it is too early to say whether this afternoon’s events will result in a total freezer defrosting situation or a simple wipe with a cloth, but more information will be provided as soon as it comes to hand.

Although visibly distressed, Mum was unavailable for comment as she was performing an internet search of recipes for beer-battered sausages.

Facebook Ad For Hair Loss Product Ruins Local Man’s Day

TEXT:

Although primarily serving as a reminder that people have different political opinions to you, Facebook feeds are still providing users with an opportunity to feel like utter shit about themselves.

One such incident took place for project manager Jason John (28) who had his day and dignity compromised by a Facebook advert for a product that claims to treat hair loss.

Although in his late-twenties, John has begun to look a bit thin on top due to a combination of genetics and constant stress regarding an upcoming climate change-induced apocalypse.

Being constantly reminded of his thinning hair by overhead lighting and mates who are balder than him, John was not able to move past the reminder of his deteriorating hairline that was provided to him by a targeted Facebook ad.

“It affects 20% of men in their 20s? Fuck, I thought it was more than that,” stated John, staring past his phone and into a lifetime of being like the bald people he was always looked down upon.

“How do I hide this fucking ad?”

Putting on a brave face, John showed up to work and tried to go about his day without the thought that his work colleagues were looking at his hairline, wondering how long it would be before he shaved the lot.

“Should I grow a beard? I don’t know if I want to be a beard bald guy. Maybe tatts? Don’t think I wanna be a tatted bald guy either.”

“Maybe a hat?”

Unable to focus, John was seen leaving work early, mentioning something about buying a razor on the way home, the final use of which remains unknown.

“Fucking ad.”

Phone Books Now To Be Delivered Directly To Recycling Bins

TEXT:

In a move applauded by green groups, Yellow Pages has announced plans to deliver it’s iconic telephone directories directly to the nation’s recycling bins. 

Studies have shown that usage of the once-indispensable directories has recently fallen with the advent of the internet and the aftermath of several Police Royal Commissions.

Listen here to our interview with Deputy Premier of NSW John Barilaro: 

A spokesman for the company that gave Australia the famous “Not happy Jan” television commercial and some very large books that nobody with internet access actually uses, says “We still need to publish them, because people need to know what number to call if the internet stops working, but in reality most are immediately recycled, so this is all about getting the consumer on-side by not forcing them to make an extra trip from the front door to the recycling bin. 

Also, in the event that they actually decide to keep their phone book for some reason, they can just climb into their recycling bin to get it out. It’s all about keeping the public happy”. 

When asked whether the process could be further streamlined in the future, the unidentified spokesman replied they were looking into recycling the books as soon as they came off the printing press, although they would first confirm the books were no longer required at local Police Stations.

Looming A-League Season Kick-Off Arrives Just In Time To Justify Another Round

TEXT:

A couple of huge soccer fans have today been given reason to hang around for another one this evening. 

In some breaking news from a pub in Betoota’s Old City district, a couple of roundball enthusiasts have decided that they better not make tracks just yet, because the new season of the A-League is about to kick off. 

Despite being unable to name a single player setting foot on the turf during tonight’s opener between Sydney FC and Adelaide United, it’s believed the crowd are keen to hang around and keep an eye on it. 

“Yeah, may as well just watch a bit of it here and see how we go,” said the keenest of the group, angling for another round or two to the wet the whistle for a potential blow out. 

With the happy hour pints of Betoota Bitter going down like middys, the rest of the group agreed.

“Yeah, let’s watch the soccer. Could be good,” laughed another. 

“I think you are supposed to call it fooooot ballll mate,” interrupted someone before the conversation went off on some random tangent and our reporter left.

Nation Surprised A Coastal Town Councillor Is A Bit Crook

TEXT:

It’s apparently big news this morning that someone who dreams of being a local mayor might be a bit of a weird creeper.

This comes after Noosa Councillor Jess Glasgow made some rank comments on last night’s episode of The Bachelorette. 

The member of local government who has been described by many as a ‘creep’ and by many more as definitely ‘a bit off,’ has since been kicked off the show for his behaviour.

Cr Glasgow (who says he wants to be the Mayor one day) told Bachelorette Angie Kent not to mind ‘his wandering fingers,’ before telling other contestants “I would have just grabbed that sweetie and laid one on her. I’ve kissed plenty of girls and they’ve turned their heads before; I’m used to it.”

Those comments have also seen the Local Mayor and many others suggest that he probably should resign from his representative position.

While Noosa Council deals with the fallout of the reality TV appearance, the rest of nation is currently dealing with the realisation that a member of local government is actually ‘a bit off’.

“It’s so weird,” said one avid viewer.

“Councillors and mayors are normal such stand-up people, who never commit sleazy acts or rip of the ratepayer,” she said.

“People usually run for these positions because they want to help people, not the financial interests of their families or mates and act like a bit of a pig at numerous functions.”

“So it’s just so odd that this councillor was a bit weird.”

Inner-City Woman Hungover Enough To Order Domino’s Instead Of Normal Woodfired Pizza

TEXT:

Local food enthusiast, Hannah Hellier, has shown her truest colours this morning as she lays lifeless on the couch wondering why, at 29, her and her friends still insist on getting blackout drunk.    

While a hungover Hannah is not unusual, the shock came after the blatant food snob (#kale) suggested that they order Domino’s pizza instead of the $30 artisan wood fire pizza she usually forces her housemates to eat.  

“Guys, fuck it. If I don’t get a BBQ meat lovers in my mouth in 45 minutes I’m going to kill someone” she exclaimed to her roommates.    

“And garlic bread”    

“Do they still have those chocolate lava cakes? Get two of those too” Hannah groaned.   

It’s understood that the last time Hannah ate any form of fast food was in 2017, when she was in a similar state and ordered 3 McDonald’s Hot Apple Pies to her door.   

Since the Apple Pie Incident, Hannah vowed to not let herself get low enough for it to happen again. 

But given her desperate demands for Domino’s, it’s clear she has let herself go.    

According to reports from the French Quarter restaurant the girls were lunching at, it’s surprising Hannah can even stomach anything.    

Witnesses say they saw Hannah doing ‘Coy Shots’, an iteration of the classic Hot Shot – only in a Coy Shot you scull a glass of rosé then swallow a whole small fish from the fish pond.    

It’s also believed the restaurant is looking for Hannah’s contact details to invoice her $2500 for eating their coy fish.   

If anyone has Hannah’s details, please contact Shochu in the French Quarter.

Local Woman Devastated To Realise She’s Now At The Age Where Bouncers Don’t Ask for ID

TEXT:

A twenty-eight-year-old account manager at a big PR agency in Betoota is consoling herself this evening after the reality of her age finally hit. 

The awakening occurred after Stephanie Bryce, was waved into a pub by the bouncer without being asked for her ID.

While this one-off event shouldn’t be the marker of age, for Stephanie this has been happening for a little while now, she explains.

“I didn’t want to accept it”

“But the truth is, I haven’t been asked for my ID for at least 7 months now” she revealed, turning away so our reporter couldn’t see her eyes welling up.

According to close friends of Stephanie’s, she hasn’t been handling it all that well.

“It’s embarrassing actually. She makes the biggest fuss about it,” revealed a friend who wished to remain anonymous.

“We’re all in line, getting our ID’s checked and it gets to her and she gets waved in, instead of going in like a normal person she makes a big deal out of not being asked for her ID”

“’That’d be right’ she always says, like just get over it.”

While ageing is a natural part of life, there are some people who take it a little harder than others. Which is probably why the beauty industry value is estimated at $532 billion and counting.

Report: Cassette Adapter Slightly More Dignifying Than Bluetooth Speaker On Passenger Seat

TEXT:

A 7-hour road trip has got off to an average start today after the owner and driver of the car revealed that their car isn’t capable of playing an iPod unless it’s through a cassette adapter.

The owner/driver, Georgia McLight, began by apologising and trying to put things into perspective for her ungrateful passengers. 

“Ease up, at least it’s better than having a portable Bluetooth speaker on the back seat” 

“Not by much, but it is.” 

The advocate reached out to social commentator Gilles Doutran to see if Georgia was committing some kind of faux pas in offering up her car in the first place.

“Yes, valid point. It raises the question of why the friends accepted to ride in Georgia’s povo car”

“There are a number of reasons; the trip back is a big one though. Nobody wants to drive hungover.” 

“So, having no proper music system is a small price to pay to have someone else drive you around”

Truer words have never been spoken, everyone who’s ever had a hangover can attest to how horrific driving long distances hungover is one of the worse things we have to endure in life, far worse than a povo car that for some reason is only capable of playing music through a medium that most people people thought was filtered out in the early 1990s.

Local Property Investors Call Off Plan To Get Another Iconic Pub Shut Down As Market Rebounds

TEXT:

In a relief for Australian property investors, house prices have recorded their third consecutive month of rises since hitting the floor in May.

This comes as the weekend’s sales show the biggest monthly rebound in two and a half years, led by a strong recovery in the capital cities, which are the only markets that the media or politicians care about.

Despite the fact that prices remain 6.8pc below the peak of October 2017, today’s news is a huge relief for several property investors and prominent Quiet Australians, Shannon and Neville Ohldcodger (both 65), from Betoota Grove.

“Phewww” says says Shannon, a stay-at-home empty-nester mother of three adults kids that now run her husband’s plastic cable casing manufacturing company whose operations have been based entirely out of Taiwan since 1995.

“It was looking like we weren’t going to get exactly what we wanted, and what our generation has convinced ourselves that we are owed” 

Neville is also happy with the result, and is glad that he and his wife can now relax at Noosa for 16 weeks of the year knowing that the several investment properties they purchased for 10% of their current value in 1999, are still relatively safe.

“We nearly had to take things into our own hands” says Neville.

“There’s a live music venue a few blocks away that is known for hosting big Friday nights… That was gonna be next on the chopping block”

Neville points out that while he’s all for small businesses, as is the Liberal voter way, nothing is going to get between him and his nest egg, or nest eggs.

“If the market didn’t correct itself, it was gonna be a matter of us sitting on the phone calling the cops as many times as we could each weekend to file noise complaints, like we did with the last one”

“Either that or the public housing block near the shopping centre was gonna have to be relocated out west [haha]”

“I play golf with some of the local councillors and let me just say, they have the exact same concerns as we do when it comes to their investments”

The rebound continues to be led by Sydney and Melbourne, with Canberra, Betoota and Brisbane the only other capitals making smaller gains in September.

Boss Surprises Employees With Meeting That Actually Couldn’t Have Been Covered In An Email

Employees at digital solutions company, Bean Bit, encountered the rarest of workplace experiences earlier this week; a meeting that had a purpose.

In a meeting of the five-person planning department, team leader Wally Nage (44) surprised the living shit out of his team by facilitating an agenda-driven meeting with a desirable outcome.

“Did my boss just have a meeting that was worthwhile?” asked team member Jules Stephens.

“Like, we just covered so much stuff. It was almost like we HAD to have a meeting. I don’t think we could have done that over email”

“Is he dying?”

Members of the planning department were also surprised to see they didn’t a typo-strewn wall of unintelligible text from their team leader following a meeting they may one day live to tell their grandchildren about.

“Has he joined a cult? I’m actually beginning to look forward to work. What the fuck is happening?” asked a 29-year-old team member.

Nage’s efforts have not gone unnoticed by Bean Bit manager staff who after an estimated five years of negotiations, will be able to present the efficient team leader with a congratulatory Gloria Jeans voucher.

“Has he had that spell done to him from Harry Potter where they’re being mind-controlled?”

While staff members have a variety of theories as to why their boss is performing with respect and proficiency, Nage himself offers a straightforward answer for his responsible use of company time.

“I’ve started drinking at work. Really keeps me on my toes.”

Dad Risks Being Unfriended After Sharing Two Facebook ‘Unclaimed Prize’ Spams In One Week

TEXT:

Dad is on thin ice, according to his family, after sharing another Facebook spam post; his second this week. 

The clearly-bullshit posts claim that a brand-new Winnebago was an unclaimed prize and will be given away for no apparent reason to someone that adds a comment.

Oldest son, James has had enough. “I keep telling Dad they’re bullshit. Why would any company give away a saleable product for no commercial gain whilst cannibalising their own sales by giving the product to a potential customer? 

But he just says “Hey, you gotta be in it to win it, right?””

“First it was the memes with the ugly chicks who were “looking for James”, then it was anything that started with an Australian flag and ended with “Share if you agree!” But being spammed by your own father? That is low, man. Real low”.

With his father seemingly blinded by the thought of winning a non-existent campervan, and a computer-illiterate mother, James had run out of options and was forced to take matters into his own hands.

“I’ve already had an intervention, sort of. I sat Dad down; I told him, “mate, you’re a good bloke, I’ve known you for a long time. But it can’t go on like this, I need you to make a choice. It’s me or the fake Winnebagos”.

It was really emotional. I don’t think he realised how strongly I felt about it, but I can’t let it go on like this. I’ve limited him to falling for one fake competition per month. Any more than that and I will be forced to unfriend him, forever.”

Elderly Woman Living Near High School Baffled by Mysterious Shrinking Garden Hose

TEXT:

Scepticism has greeted a claim by local woman Hilda Beckitts that her garden hose is somehow shrinking of it’s own accord. 

Hilda, 84, who lives just down the road from Betoota Heights high school, says she distinctly remembers purchasing a 30m hose in 2017, but now it appears to be less than half that length. 

Even more bizarre is the fact that the similar garden hose in her backyard with the industrial nozzle appears to be totally unaffected by the strange phenomena.

“Everybody thinks I’m going senile, but I used to use this exact same house to water the cliveas, and now it doesn’t even make it past the hydrangea bush.”

Hilda says her son, who is also technically a senior citizen but one with far less time on his hands appears to have no answers when it comes to the mystery shrinking hose.

“It seems to get a couple of inches shorter every other week. When I asked my son, he said perhaps the hose was getting shorter due to the colder weather, but that doesn’t make any sense.

“Later he asked me if any other strange things had been happening and if I’d ever considered moving to somewhere “more comfortable”.

Local High Schoolers and keen recyclers Ricky and Davo, who were passing by at the time of our interview said they knew nothing about the shrinking hose. However, they did promise to check it out on the way back from the Return & Earn depot where they were taking their empty Gatorade bottle.

Local Man Suffers Dislocated Shoulder Trying To Get Some Fucken Sauce On His Nandos

Ambulance crews are on the scene at a prominent high-end fast food outlet this afternoon, following an incident at the condiments table.

The Betoota Grove man says all he was trying to do was get a decent splash of Peri Peri on his shameful post-work sit-down quarter chicken and chips.

“I was gonna get stuck in peak hour anyway” says Declan Liston (32) who sounded more like he was trying to justify his heavy late-afternoon meal to his wife than our reporters.

“I just thought I’d smash some European food until the traffic dies down. I didn’t want this to be a big thing. I put it on the splurge account. Just fucken get those cameras away from me”

The mid-to-weirdly-high-priced Portuguese chicken retailer, known as Nandos, is one of three franchises in our town’s not that shitty suburbs. The restaurant chain has for many years faced feirce criticism over its impossible sauce containers.

Ambulance personal say they attend five to six Nandos-sauce-related call-outs each week, and Declan is one of the lucky ones.

“He’s lucky he didn’t put his back out, or land on one of the pointy chairs with his head” said the QLD ambulance first-responder, Campbell Beattie.

“As emergency workers, we aren’t in a position to comment on public safety, but personally I think something needs to change. They need squeezable bottles or something. Someone is gonna die soon”

A spokesperson for Nandos said they send their condolences to Declan, but if he wants an unlimited stream of sauce on his chicken he should re-mortgage his house and buy a take-home bottle in-store.

Dad’s 20-Year-Old New Balance Joggers The Deciding Factor In His Baggage Being Overweight

TEXT:

Shit has hit the fan at Betoota Domestic Airport today after a local dad was told by airport staff that he had exceeded his weight allowance and would have to remove some items should he wish to board his flight.  

Not one to take direction from younger people well, Jim Twinings, very begrudgingly began unpacking his suitcase at the baggage drop desk – despite being asked by staff to move to the side.   

“Can’t fuckin’ spare 4 kilograms” he was heard muttering to himself.   

Witnesses at the scene say Jim unpacked and packed his suitcase a number of times and still wasn’t meeting the weight restrictions. 

That was until he lifted a sky-blue polo shirt to reveal the culprit. 

It’s been confirmed that underneath the polo shirt was a pair of faded white New Balance joggers that Jim had owned for over 20 years. 

Reports from the scene say removing the joggers from his bag saved him 6kg.   

The Advocate managed to interview Jim before he and his family boarded their flight to Townsville for their family holiday.  

“Who would have thought my old kicks would weigh so much? Guess it’s safe to say they don’t make shoes like they used to ‘ey” he said jovially to our reporter.   

Apparently, his kids knew they would weigh that much, in fact they told him not to pack them.   

“We told him they would weigh too much but he didn’t listen.”   

It’s not yet known whether his kids were looking out for his baggage weight limit or protecting their own reputations, lest they are seen in public with their dad while he wore white bricks.

Oh Fuck: New Guy At Work ‘A Hugger’

An accountants agency has become an even more hostile environment with the unexpected addition of affection.

Local financial firm, Carter’s Chartered Accountants, recently welcomed financial adviser Mike Burton (33) who has wrought havoc on the rest of his team.

“HR introduced us and then he ignored my offer for a handshake. Before I knew it, I was being embraced by him and looking over his shoulder to see myself exchanging traumatised faces with the HR team.”

Employees state Burton never misses an opportunity to initiate a hug, having once offered a hug for the simple reason he and a coworker had the same brand of muesli bar.

“Look, we’re probably going to have to fire him,” stated GM Anne Lin.

“He’s brilliant at his job, it’s just that he keeps trying to hug people which basically makes him the worst person alive.”

Public Speaking Subjects Fails To Prepare Arts Grad For Negotiating With Drunk Blokes In Pokies

TEXT:

Local bartender Liv Cotric (25) stated that as she was forced to call security on a patron for the 30th time this year, she had an overwhelming sense that her arts degree from a regional university really should have done something to prepare her for this.

Graduating from Betoota University, Cotric was awarded the employment opportunities one is endowed with after completing an arts degree.

She elected for bartending at Betoota RSL after she was unable to find a career in “fuck knows.”

Although challenging at first, Cotric states she has enjoyed many aspects of her job, such as the familiar sense of not learning much mixed with the feeling of having no options. 

However, Cotric states any bounties her degree posses are tarnished by the constant need to be an adult that hospitality demands.

“I had to tell a guy to get his hands out of his shoes yesterday,” exclaimed Cotric fumbling with a pack of Panadol.

“It was the third time I’d told him that day.” 

“Why wasn’t I ready for this?”

According to Cotric, the majority of the bar’s patrons and locals are a respectful group who like to watch the footy with strangers.

“But some of them would rather fingerpaint their shorts with a mixture of dribble and piss. And I’m the one who is somehow qualified to deal with this?”

Catch Up With Old Schoolmates Descends Into Stories About Punch Ons

TEXT:

With social media constantly reminding us about people that would otherwise be left in the past, more and more of us are being forced to catch up with people from high school.

One such gathering took place in Betoota’s Flight Path District as a group who self-described as ‘The Boys’ reunited to catch up and show how unworthy they were of the title ‘The Men.’

After some general chat about jobs and families they already knew the answer to due to social media, it is estimated that an old scrap was brought up sometime during the third round.

“I remember this cunt, full had the southern cross tattoo,” laughed one of ‘The Boys’ while squaring up to recreate a punch.

“Boof! Fuck that was funny!”

From there, it is believed stories about punch ons was the only topic of conversation for the rest of the night, including recreations, best train stations for biffs and how much the attitude around punching each other has changed.

“Everything is different now. You’re not supposed to call it King Hitting anymore. You’re also not supposed to do it in general really.”

CCTV footage shows the rumble reminiscing continued until 1:20 am when they had run out of fights to discuss and went home. 

Brief plans were made for a future catch up with some members of ‘The Boys’ privately confiding they hoped to discuss other things next time.

“Was looking forward to talking to some of the guys about kids and also how we don’t see each other any more but I still think about them but never mind. This was good too.”

“Schools Need To Bring Back The Cane,” Says Bloke Who Says All Cops Are Power Trippers

TEXT:

MPs trying to pass the pub test could learn a thing or two from local pokies dweller Shane Clay (48) as his eighth Bundy and Coke and sixth pineapple fed into the Queen of the Nile have brought his opinions out in full force.

As the alcohol increases his leniency to justify his already widely shared opinions, onlookers were forced to become spectators as an increasingly dribble soaked Clay explained how he would run the country.

“Schools need to bring back the cane,” dribbled Clay to his reluctant audience.

Witnesses state Clay slipped back and forth on topics varying from how political correctness offends him and how all coppers are power trippers.

“They just wanna get back at ya because ya didn’t- mean they didn’t eva get on the footy team. I didn’t get on the footy team either and I’m not a grub about it.”

What grace Clay lacked in eloquence he made up for in skillfully switching stances as his anti-police rant was later countered by his support for the AFP journalist raids.

“Information is classified for a reason, ya don’t need a university degree to tell ya that, why anyone has trouble understanding that is beyond me.”

Husband Throws Out $200 Tupperware Like A Thai Take Away Container

TEXT:

A local cabinetry maker has caused a scene this morning after throwing out his wife’s $200 glass Tupperware instead of cleaning it like a normal human.

It’s believed the container Brandon Lofty threw out had 2-week old Thai fish curry in it, a pungent dish at the best of times, but after a 2-week stint festering in the fridge, Brandon decided opening the dish might be more like a mushroom bomb.

Sitting down with The Advocate shortly after he threw out his wife’s container, Brandon explained to our reporter that he’s not looking forward to her finding out.

“Yeah, look, in hindsight it wasn’t the smartest thing I’ve ever done”

“I haven’t slipped up in a while, so she might let me off the hook. Unlikely though, pretty sure she dropped a couple hundred on it!” 

“But there was just no way I was going to open it”

According to a Betoota science lab where the container was sent for testing, the container had bred over 3 million bacteria – some of which were classified as superbugs.

“It’s quite terrifying actually” explained the scientist. 

“We had to inject the container with petrol, then incinerate it. We couldn’t risk the superbug bacteria getting out.”

Rattled Restaurant Manager Asks Local Bushy If He’d Like Some Steak With His Salt

TEXT:

A local restaurant manager is being treated for shock after he witnessed a customer completely destroy a wagyu steak with 3 tablespoons worth of salt. 

“I couldn’t stop him” a rattled Carlos Manuela told our reporter over the phone while cowering in the cool room. 

“The customer is always right, but this?” 

“I tried to make a joke with him, I say ‘you want some steak with you salt’ but he didn’t even get it” 

“I had to leave, I couldn’t watch anymore” 

The customer in question is local soybean farmer Dareth Brookes, who, according to Carlos, ruined a $85 award-winning wagyu steak like it was a Coles special. 

It’s believed he’s just ordered a tiramisu for dessert, and it’s not yet confirmed as Carlos is still outside with paramedics. 

There’s been some speculation around whether Mr Brookes will add salt to his tiramisu, The Advocate has sent a reporter down to the French Quarter restaurant to meet Mr Brookes for an interview as he exits the restaurant.

Country Girl Hoping Entire Staff Party Drunk Enough That No One Notices Her Moving To The Rums

TEXT:

After hazily scouring the room through squinted eyes, a drunk Sarah Thornhill is slowly making her way towards the bar to take her night into the rumosphere. 

For someone who’s often described as boisterous and attention seeking, Sarah is tonight sneaking through the crowd with a rum in each hand, praying to her white bear god that no one notices her. 

While Sarah isn’t usually ashamed of drinking a couple rumbos, her drunken self just isn’t ready to cop the ridicule from her posh interior designer colleagues. 

Unfortunately for Sarah, how she was sneaking in her mind and how she was sneaking in real life were completely different, causing both her bosses to turn around and catch her brown handed. 

“Sarah, ew, are you drinking rum?” One boss laughed. 

“You can take the girl out of the country, but you can’t take the country out of the girl, am I right?!” Cackled the other. 

“Emma, Emma, look! Sarah’s already on the rums!” The boss said, calling over more colleagues to look at Sarah. 

At this point Sarah gave up being conspicuous and skolled both the drinks in front of her bosses.

Girls Drinks Pauses For Moment Of Solemn Reflection After Anaconda Comes On

TEXT:

A local session in the Old City District has taken a brief moment to pause and pay thanks to one of music’s modern greats. 

Getting together for a slowly accelerating catch up, a group of girls were well on their way after a few happy hour margaritas. 

However, with a cheese board demolished and the second bottle of rose almost a done deal, the group have paused briefly to reflect upon the retirement of Nicki Minaj. 

“Fuck, did you see the news,” said one of the group to the others. 

The others confirmed that they had, prompting sad nods and sips of rosé for NMaj. 

That sombre moment was brought on by the hit song Anaconda coming on over the airways at the local bar. 

Onika Tanya Maraj, known professionally as Nicki Minaj, is a Trinidad and Tobago-born rapper, singer, songwriter, record producer, actress, and model who announced she was retiring from music to start a family. 

That news, that one of the all-time bad gal hype song creators is pulling at stumps has saddened many around the world, as the crown is now most certainly passed onto Cardi B. 

After paying their respects to Minaj, the girls then decided to honour the artist and get back into it.

Corporate Party Gal Brings In First Friday Of Spring With Floral Pattern That Could Blind Ya

TEXT:

Things often feel bleak at the Betoota Direct Orders Of Outdoor Furniture (DOOF) head office.

Not necessarily because of the rise of online competitors, or the founder and CEO’s very public in-house infidelities that appear to have shaken the business to its core.

But because this place is mostly made up of time-stamp punching lifers who are just waiting out their 25 years until they get the medium priced wristwatch and a complimentary set of Ottoman chairs that have somehow been negotiated into the employment contracts as a compromise to staff bonuses and long service leave.

Even though the windows are wide open with a mild September breeze blowing in, and talk of management putting on 2-3 Friday arvo beers for each staff member down the road at the underwhelming Irish pub frequented by similarly humourless corporate drones – the office halls of Betoota DOOF HQ are as low on energy as they always are.

That was until the Assistant Head Of Sales, Stacey Beeharry (37) came steaming in from her string of morning meetings and a 1 o’clock lunch with some clients.

As 4pm arrives with fuck all but a few conversations about tonight’s match between Manly and Parra between the only two blokes who support Manly and Parra in the office – Stacey brings a much needed burst of energy to ramp up the TGIF atmosphere.

“Who’s coming to the pub” says Stacey, almost like she’s rounding up cattle at a campdraft.

“Hope you got your drinking boots on!!!”

With her dormant girl gang of receptionists and junior sales assistants stirring from their dormant slumber, the office is brought to life with the clip clop of corporate heels that will be replaced by runners for a silent train commute home to the suburbs in roughly two and half hours.

With her special floral outfit made up of radioactive fluro colours sending an electric energy through the room, Stacey is now pushing the mob like the Man From Snowy River.

Within minutes the Friday springtime dress had the whole office up and about stretching their shoulders as they made a Congo line for the pub.

At time of press, the new intern Jaxon was all but incinerating his chances of a full time employment contract by telling his devout Hillsong superviser Bradley about the time he and his mates threw pool balls through the windshield of a police car during an out of control house party in Betoota Ponds.

Man That Wears Fedora With Straight Face Reveals He’s More Into Jazz Music

TEXT:

In news that has shocked literally no one, a local fedora-wearing man has revealed to The Advocate that he actually enjoys listening to jazz music.  

Quentin Gilmore, a 40-year-old miniature train specialist, made the confession while sipping a piccolo at a French Quarter café.

“You wouldn’t think it, but I love jazz”

“It just speaks to me”

“skeep-beep de bop-bop beep bop bo-dope” he scattered with his eyes closed.

Jazz is American music developed especially from the blues and is characterised by propulsive syncopated rhythms, polyphonic ensemble playing, varying degrees of improvisation, and often deliberate distortions of pitch and timbre.

As for when he started wearing a fedora, Quentin explains it was when he started to lose his hair.

“I started balding pretty early on, I think I was about 22?”

“The fedora just seemed like the right fit, I haven’t really taken it off since!”

Relationship Now Serious Enough For Local Girl To Show New Boyfriend Her License Photo

April Carmen and Trick Lockett have been dating for eight and a half months.

The young couple began dating after Trick hit on April at the Betoota Ute Muster late last year, and since then the two love birds have gone from strength to strength.

They’ve gone through all the major milestones; graduating from texting to calling, sleeping over on sober nights and one other that is no doubt a testament of true love.

April has today thrown caution to the wind and shown Trick her license photo, a photo so bad that literally only her mother could love it.

So, when Trick didn’t even flinch at the hideous photo, April knew it must be love.

“I was ready for him to drop me then and there, but he didn’t!” April told our reporter while staring lovingly into the eyes of Trick.

“It’s not even that bad! I don’t know why you were so afraid to show me, here, you have a look” Trick said to our reporter.

Unfortunately for our reporter, her reactions to April’s photo weren’t as poker-faced, thus bringing the interview to an appropriate end.

Dad Visibly Disappointed His Family Took The Old “Don’t Get Me Anything” Literally

TEXT:

A local dad has struggled to hide his emotions this morning after waking up on Father’s Day and finding that his family had done absolutely nothing for him.

Speaking to The Advocate over a piece of Vegemite toast, Trenton Edwards, explained how this is the first time all year that his family has listened to anything he’s said.

“They asked me what I want for Father’s Day and I said I didn’t want anything”

“I didn’t know they’d take it literally”

“Every other time I ask them do something for me it seems to fall on fucken’ deaf ears!”

“I wasn’t expecting much, but a cooked breakfast would have been good. Or a new pair of secateurs wouldn’t have gone astray either.”

Father’s Day is a celebration celebrating fatherhood, paternal bonds and the influence of fathers in society. Despite the rest of the world celebrating the day on the third Sunday of June, Australia celebrates it on the first Saturday of September.

The Advocate can confirm that Australia elected to celebrate on a different day purely due to a capitalist marketing calendar.

“People get ‘calendar fatigue’” explained a professional. “If there are too many days, they stop seeing them as a reason to buy pointless presents.”

“But fuck it, people make their own decisions. I don’t feel responsible for making them feel inadequate if they don’t buy their dad something.”

Office Boomer Found To Be The Only One Going Near The Arrowroots

TEXT:

CCTV footage from inside a Betoota cardboard box factory has solved one of 4Sides’s biggest workplace mysteries.

For months the emptying of the kitchen biscuit jar had remained shrouded in mystery, however, The Advocate can now exclusively reveal it was operations manager, Terry Kapp (65).

Despite arrowroots being the shittest biscuits, Terry has been filmed eating upwards of 5 biscuits a day – often dipping the biscuits in a cup of tea. 

However, on odd occasions, it appears as though he is just gnawing on the dry biscuits and even licking them like a horse would with salt-lick.

In the most intriguing video, Terry challenged himself to an arrowroot eating competition where he attempted to fit the most possible arrowroots in his mouth at once – he managed to fit 6 in before choking and vomiting in the kitchen sink.

What remains puzzling to security and the office manager who re-stocks the biscuits, is that there are at least 5 other biscuit flavours that Terry could choose – all undeniably tastier than an arrowroot.

One possible reason for Terry’s lacklustre tastebuds is that he longs for blander foods reminiscent of his upbringing. 

Growing up on a farm 100km west of Betoota, Terry wasn’t exposed to any fancy food like his townie cousins.

The Advocate has reached out to Terry for comment but are yet to hear back.

In an effort to make himself seem less alone to a 19-year-old bartender, a local city worker asked for two schooners with his $10 jug of Tiger to give the illusion that he’s waiting for somebody to join him.

The only time Roger Spearman gets to spend on his own is the commute to and from his home in Betoota Heights.

So on the way home today, he walked past the Fisherman’s Arms next door to the Old City District bus depot and thought he’d duck in for an hour.

He texted his husband saying he’d been held up; he wrote back saying that was OK. Roger had bought himself an hour and offloaded school pick up.

There he sat in the beer garden of the Fisho, with the sun on his back. A smile on his face. The beer was cold and cheaper than a Rodney Rude one-liner. Just the way the professionally popular network engineer likes it. 

Also enjoying a few solo phone jugs in the Fisho’s beer garden this afternoon was our reporter. 

He shared a nod with Roger before he went back to his phone and smiled.

Bloke Who Got Stung By A Breathalyser After 20 Tins Reckons You Get That On Them Bigger Jobs

TEXT:

Local storeman, Adrian Masina (55) has today written off rather serious criminal charges and the subsequent pressure put on his marriage as simply a result of what you get on them bigger jobs.

It seems after last Friday arvo’s knock off drinks, Adrian and a couple of his colleagues decided to push the boat out a bit further and hit the local tavern for a bit of sightseeing – only because it was within walking distance.

However, throughout this magical evening of abusing pokie machines and tipping topless backpackers way too much money, the popular middle-management warehouse employee only managed to eat a handful of springies.

While, the lack of food in his belly could possibly explain the amount of trouble he found himself in later that night, there was really no escaping the strong hand of the law when they caught up with him a couple blocks away.

“Haha. I shoulda locked my keys in my ute” he says to his workmates, between bursts of smokers-cough-laughter over smoko today.

“The missus says I’m lucky she’s letting me sleep in the house”

When asked how he’s planning on getting to and from work each day after being pinged on the breathalyser after 20 standard drinks, Adrian says 

“Coppers reckon there’s no chance I’ll be able to get a work licence” he says.

“Guess I’m riding the brother-in-laws Cannondale to and from work each day for now”

“Ahhh well. You get that on them bigger jobs”

While the younger protein shake-type blokes in the warehouse looked at him with judgemental half-cocked smiles, Adrian writes off their holier-than-thou bullshit.

“At least I’m not out there eating disco bickies every weekend like you Metrosexuals!” shouts the defensive Adrian, dishing out the ultimate sledge – in the eyes of old codgers on worksites.

Juul-Crazed Hipster Never Smoked Anywhere Near This Much When She Was On The Rollies

TEXT:

A local inner-city corporate creative’s transition from one a fortnight social smoker to full-blown vaper has been brought into question today.

This comes after Indi Austen (22) powered through two Juul pods in one sitting last night.

Juul is an electronic cigarette company that makes the Juul e-cigarette, which packages nicotine salts from leaf tobacco into one-time use cartridges.

Each cartridge, or ‘pod’, equates to roughly an entire pack of durries and the model is responsible for bringing nicotine addictions roaring back into social situations.

The Juul became the most popular e-cigarette in Australia and theUnited States at the end of 2017 and has a market share of 72% as of September 2018

While Australian vapers refuse to admit that seeing Leonardo DiCaprio with a Juul is the main reason they bought one of these new tobacco vaporisers, it remains the gold standard for ex-ciggie smokers around the country.

However, when it comes to Indi, the many different waves of state government legislation regarding smoking ettiquette does not apply.

Her friends, who were made up of mostly casual ciggie smokers or non-smokers all together, marvelled as the young marketing professional took in equivalent to two full packs of cigarettes while drinking at a low key Al Fresco suburban restaurant.

“She started smoking the Juul because she wanted to pull back on the drunken ciggies” says one concerned friend, Ally.

“But she would only ever smoke one our two. She’s just inhaled 24 grams of nicotine. She hits that thing on the loo”

Indi was approached for comment about her addiction, but all she said was that she really wants to try this new watermelon flavour she keeps hearing about.

Local Dad Asks Owner Of 3rd-Generation Rural Thai Restaurant To Explain Hong Kong Protests

In the Larson household, Sunday night is usually reserved for a little bit of culture.

Whether it’s pub choir or a some local oriental cuisine, the family clears the schedule and gets everyone together. Last night it was Thai.

Kerry Larson (60) appears to be getting a bit more experimental with age. Once upon a time, his idea of ethnic food was a spag bol, or a butter chicken – but nowadays he’s all about the pad kee mao and spring rolls.

After a delightful evening drinking pure blondes and medium-chilli noodles at Betoota’s iconic ‘Thai One On’ – Kerry and his wife Alison make their way to the front desk to pay the bill. But only after talking to the restaurant matriarch for 45 minutes about socio-global politics in southern Asia.

“Jeez wouldn’t wanna be in Hong Kong right now!” says Kerry.

“Oh tell me about it!” says Alison, while their adult kids awkwardly loiter far enough away to not have to chip in for dinner.

The owner of the restaurant, Barbara, a third-generation purveyor of the finest rural Thai food in Outback Queensland, knows as much about what’s happening in Hong Kong as she knows about her son’s cryptocurrency investments. But still, she entertains this cultural mix-up.

“Oh yeah!” says Barbara. 

“I saw that on the news”

Both Kerry and Alison suspect that Barbara is being polite by avoiding a political conversation her Asian homeland, so they make it clear that they are open to any opinions on the matter.

“What are your thoughts on all of that?” asks Kerry.

“Do you agree with the protestors”

Barbara sighs as she recalls a conversation she had earlier tonight with a bunch of miners about the Bali ash cloud.

Kerry perseveres. 

“Do you have any family that are involved?”

In Kerry’s defence, this particular family diner has always pitched itself as an ‘Asian Restaurant’ in order to encourage a wider customer base – which is why he thinks the Barbara is the person to explain to him the civil unrest in Hong Kong regarding a Beijing led extradition arrangement with China.

Barbara decides to lean into these suburban racial gaffes and treat her customers to a fictional universe where she is in fact a Hong Kong native, instead of a Thai-Australian woman born in Toowoomba in the 1970s –  in an effort to maximise Kerry and Alison’s oriental dining experience. 

“Oh yes!” she says.

“My nephew is one of the protestors that was flogging the cops in the airport.”

Kerry chuckles.

“Is that right?! haha”

“Good on him”

“Fux Scar Non” Enquires 1985 VK Commodore Owner

In the heart of Betoota’s Flight Path District, the intersection between Peter Beattie Boulevard and Samantha Riley Drive is not generally known as a hot spot for locals to socialise.

That is, unless it’s 3am on a Wednesday morning and the local Vietnamese gangs are taking over the adjacent CostCo car park with their heavily modified Nissans and WRXs.

But aside from the illegal car shows and the occasional junkie trying to clean your car window, it is not the type of place you pull up for a yarn.

That was until this arvo, when local 1985 VK Commodore owner Nic Katsis noticed someone admiring his the new Cerulean paint job on his high performance Australian made muscle vehicle.

Nic, catching eyes with a bunch of awkward teenage boys he caught staring from the back of one of their mum’s Tarago, gives off a smirk.

The Greek flag-themed boxing gloves hanging off his rear-view mirror suggests that Nic fancies himself as a bit of a goer. So the kids, even with their limited street smart, know not to say anything cheeky.

Nic can see how reserved the young fellas are being, so he speaks first.

“Fux scar non” asks Nic, trying obviously to be as chirpy as possible, to avoid spooking the mum. It doesn’t work. His Flight Path District creole is far too brash for these easily-influenced kids.

“What did you just say?!” asks the horrified mother.

Nic smiles even more, and then repeats his question.

“FUX SCAR NON?!” he says, before taking off on the green light in third gear with a deafening canon exhaust.

80% Of Phone Call With Country Parents Spent Asking Each Other If You Can Hear Them

TEXT:

A recent survey carried out by a Betoota tech and communications agency, TechComm, has revealed some staggering results around phone coverage in the Diamantina region.

For the majority of Betootanese parents, a weekly phone call with their children living interstate is the only chance they get to touch base. 

However, as the survey reveals, 80% of these conversations are spent asking each other if they can hear them.

The Advocate managed to secure a transcript of one such conversation, which, according to TechComm is how the majority of phone calls play out.

“Yeah, mum, can you hear me?”

“Yes darling, how are you?”

“Mum, are you there?”

“Oh, sorry darling, I’ve lost you”

“Oh nah, mum, I can hear you now. How are you?”

“What was that? You cut out”

“I said, how are you?”

“Good darling, and how are things in Sydney?”

“Mum? Fucking hell, I’m so sick of this shit! I’ll email you.”

This conversation is all too familiar for Betootans, and while Telstra insists it’s doing its best to fix coverage in rural areas, the reality speaks for itself.

Last month a new Telstra tower was installed on the outskirts of Betoota, however, it’s believed, to save costs Telstra installed the tower at the bottom of a hill, so it’s made next to no difference.

Locals near the new tower are ropable, according to them there were several other tower locations picked out, but Telstra selfishly opted for the cheapest one. 

The Advocate reached out to some locals, but we were unable to get through – likely because there was no phone reception.

Local PCYC Debuts Cool New PG-Rated Graffiti Mural

The Betoota Flight Path District’s PCYC (Police and Community Youth Club) has today unveiled the newest addition to their Kidz Klub activity centre, by commissioning several born again Christian to do a cool little graffiti painting on the brick wall near the basketball courts.

The new mural, which is done in the exact same style as the pieces you see on the side of the city trains, is a hit with the after-school-care kids and aspiring amateur boxers who hang out at the centre in their free time.

The artwork, which just say ‘KIDS’ is pretty cool, according to local youth Kyrone (14).

In fact Kyrone says it’s almost as cool as the other mural in the break room that literally says ‘COOL’.

However, local prudes say the mural might be sending the wrong message, and that there is no style of graffiti that is appropriate – regardless of the pretty colours.

“We said the same thing when the council built the skatepark” said Laurraine Silvertail (66) a member of Betoota Boomer Concerns (BBC).

“The council thinks they are appealing to our youth, but really they are just breeding anti-social behaviour”

“What this new mural tells our youth is that’s ok to hit the streets with a napsack full of Ironlak cans, as long as you only paint big PG-rated murals of youthful buzzwords”

“I would much prefer they spend their evenings inside playing PG video games like Fortnite”

Barista’s Good Mood Ruins The Customer Experience

TEXT:

French Quarter cafe Shoe String Co provides the neighbourhood with cups full of bitter, brown liquid that for many of the regulars is the best part of their day.

This wholesome impact may be in jeopardy however as the cafe has now hired a happy barista who is ruining the customer experience with his good mood.

The new barista Hugh Elliott (19) is taking a new approach to customer service wherein he treats his weary-eyed customers as if they need motivation in addition to caffeination.

In his short tenure as a barista, Elliott has already established a rapport amongst the locals as being the little twerp who likes to ask questions during the delicate pre-caffeine emotional state.

“Almond milk? Are you lactose or veegs?” asked the barista las if he was a friend or a qualified therapist.

“There you go, love the KeepCup, please have the sickest day hey!”

Although our modern understanding of human psychology suggests that Elliott’s upbeat mood should positively influence his customers, the reverse seems to be happening as customers wish he could be as apathetic and uncaring as regular baristas.

“That dude needs a few hard years on drugs and poorly aged sleeve tatts before he can be a good enough barista,” stated one local. 

“Why can’t that fucking psycho just be subdued like the rest of us?”

Falls Festival Group Chat Goes Dead Silent After Someone Asks Whose Car They Should Take

TEXT:

A wave of silence broke over a local group
chat this morning after discussion about how excited they are for Falls
Festival later this year turned to whose cars they’d be taking.

The group of friends, who often bond and grow
as a unit through getting sunburnt and lost at summer at festivals over New
Year’s were reportedly excited about the announcement of this year’s Falls
Festival Line Up. 

However, the pace at which the messages rolled
in this morning slowly petered out as the day rolled on. By lunch, it was as
quiet as Kings Cross Road on a Friday night. 

“Like Randy Orton out of nowhere, the fired
off question just silenced everything,” explained Lucy Anderson, one member of
the chat.

“It’s the question always on everyone’s lips,
but the question no one wants to ask, or answer.” 

“Because everyone knows whose cars we are
taking. The same cars as last year, and the same people will drive, and the
same people will moan about taking their cars, and the same people will swear
that someone else has to do it next year, and it will all repeat all over again
until we get too old to wake up in Kmart tent with our tongues glued to the
roof of our mouths.” 

“It’s that tricky group dynamic, that the
people with the cars, not me obviously, don’t want to volunteer. And the people
without the cars don’t want to be seen to pressure the others into taking their
cars, so the issue just hangs there in the balance, in a state of perfect
suspension, until someone brings it up like they did today, and we are all
forced to face the difficult topic.” 

Nevertheless, the prolonged wave of silence
has members wondering what they should do the break the ice. 

“I guess it would be good if those with cars
would just be good people and offer their services up, and we can move on with
our lives.” 

“Anyway, it will all blow over.” 

“How good will Banks be aye.”

Mum Asks If You’ll Be Cold For The Eighth Time Between Front Door And Car

TEXT:

A local mum has broken a world record yesterday evening after asking her daughter if she’s cold for the eighth time in 40 seconds – the time it’s taken the pair to walk from their front door to their car.

Beth Burton (59) and her daughter, Bridget (24), were heading into Betoota for dinner when the record-breaking incident took place. 

While it might sound like Beth is being considerate, anyone with a mother would know that the ‘won’t you be cold?’ question is more like death by a thousand cuts.

The previous record-holder, a mother of nine from Sweden, only managed to ask her daughter 4 times in 40 seconds – so Beth has absolutely smashed the record out of the park.

The Advocate caught up with Beth and Bridget to see how they were feeling about the news.

“I’m delighted” said Beth.

“But I can’t understand why it’s a record, surely every mother incessantly asks their child if they’re cold until they concede and get a jumper?”

Bridget, on the other hand, was less delighted in her mother’s award.

“It’s just encouraging her, she doesn’t need it”

“Mum, I’m not cold, we’re in Betoota and it’s 29 degrees”

“Yes, I know dear, but they might have the air conditioning on high at the restaurant, you never know”

At this point Bridget left the interview, unable to bear the hypothetical temperature change proposed by her mother. 

It’s not yet known if she was going to get a jumper or was just fed up.

Millennial Forced To Buy CD After Muso Friend Releases Album

TEXT:

Local millennial Amber Robinson (26) received a reminder that when you’re living paycheque to paycheque, it’s not just the taxman who is hitting you up for cash. 

Recently the young socialite was swindled out of an amount equivalent to an hours pay at her hospitality job at a cafe that took full advantage of penalty rate cuts. 

Earlier in the week while attending a performance of her singer/songwriter friend Gavin Bowles (31), Robinson was forced to buy one of his self-produced CDs or risk being branded a bad friend and enemy of the arts.

Although Robinson privately does not consider herself to be a fan of Bowles unashamedly bold, Jebediah-derivative brand of rock, she agreed to purchase his EP after his seventh mid-set reminder that he had put his music onto compact discs.

“20 bucks each or two for 25,” stated Bowles as if any price would have been acceptable. 

“I’ll give you change when I’ve got some smaller notes.”

With smiles painted on, the two completed the transaction trying to act as if Spotify doesn’t exist and ignoring the fact that Robinson, being a young human, does not own a CD player.

After spending the remainder of her drink budget on an antiquated form of audio format, Robinson contemplated if Bowles knows how disrupting his lifestyle is to those who still care about his dreams.

“Seven tracks? Are you fucking kidding?”

Mate’s Vague Italian Ancestry Really On Show At Dinner Party

TEXT:

“Step aside” declares local stone and tile salesman, Daniel Di Marco (38).

It’s still the early stages of a Friday night dinner party, and Daniel isn’t even the host. But he has a unique skillset that he doesn’t get to show off that often, and it is his ethnic duty to lend himself to the preparation of tonight’s feast.

Daniel’s mate Eric, who is actually hosting tonight’s event, gives very little resistance to this spectacle – knowing full well that if Daniel gets enough momentum, he’ll like clean the kitchen after as well.

Daniel is just one of many sleeper cell Italians in his greater social circle, but given his strong relationship with his Nonna, it’s him doing the hard yards tonight.

With the wives and girlfriends currently marvelling at his worldliness, Daniel begins to ramp up the theatrics.

“Hey mate can you chuck me those tinned tomatoes” he shouts at the only guy in the kitchen that he hasn’t met before, in the ultimate alpha move.

With his hands outstretched like a 3rd slip, Dan quickly flicks a tea towel over his shoulder and grabs the can opener while two cans are travelling through the air in slow mode, before taking a catch with one hand.

He quickly spins on his feet, before spinning on his heels back to the chopping board, and doing that way too far speed dicing that they do in the cooking shows.

Daniel now has three pots on the stove and a leg of lamb in the oven, he has spent the last two hours sampling the flavour of all four intermittently.

As the last guest arrives with the wine, Daniel takes a break from the kitchen and walks immediately to the brown paper bag of bottles to inspect their labels.

“Mmm. This is a good one” he says.

Kindle Reader More Than Happy To Be Interrupted By Stranger To Discuss Their Kindle

TEXT:

Increased amounts of video content in recent years means book readers have enjoyed a niche positioning as societal outcasts due to them being better than everyone else.

One such sect within this pious community are the Kindle readers who invested money to abandon their paperback cousins for the sanctimonious world of ebooks. 

Although divided on the merit of physical pieces of paper that can be placed on the shelf, the reading community remains united on one thing: talking about reading.

Evidence of this emerged on a train in Betoota’s Old City District when commuter Lynn Hyde (56) found herself being interrupted while reading her Kindle but didn’t mind when she realised it was a chance to talk about her Kindle.

“Yes I am reading The Handmaid’s Tale on my Kindle,” stated Hyde, holding her Kindle next to her face as if to impersonate a before/after comparison.

“Good book. Great Kindle.”

The interrupter in question found themselves at the mercy of Hyde’s observations of novels that were adapted into tv that is reported to be as jarring as an electronic ink screen.

“What’s also good is Gone Girl. I’d lend it to you but I read it on my Kindle. Haha, you should get one.”

Speaking exclusively with The Advocate the woman who interrupted Hyde during her fated Kindle read stated she never even asked about the book to begin with.

“I just asked if this train was stopping in the French Quarter. It didn’t.”

Barnaby Now Forced To Watch iView After Ex-Missus Changes Netflix Password

TEXT:

After a tough day for the former Deputy Prime Minister of Australia, things got even worse. 

Trying to unwind with the latest series of Stranger Things, which the maverick MP reportedly loves, Joyce was confronted with a disturbing reality. 

His ex had changed the Netflix password. 

Like hundreds of thousands of other Australians, Joyce makes the most of a Netflix account someone else pays for.

However, as many others have in the past, the Member for New England was frustrated and shocked to learn that the paying account holder had changed the Netflix password, forcing him to tune into iView. 

“I fucking like to view, do you?” said the politician referencing the ad campaign from a couple of years ago. 

“But not iView, I was at a crucial point in Stranger Things too, fuck,” said the frustrated Joyce. 

“I’ve used all my spare emails too.” 

“I’m not watching Q and A. Get fucked.”

Barnaby Forced To Borrow Mate’s Phone To Call ScoMo After Phone Runs Out Of Credit

TEXT:

Under fire National’s MP Barnaby Joyce has been forced to call in a favour today after his phone ran out of credit.

The popular tablelands representative had to ask a mate if he could borrow their phone to make ‘a heaps quick call.’ 

Joyce eventually convinced the friend to lend him their phone so he could call Sco-Mo and try and recharge the old Samsung and stay online, on what has been quite a busy day. 

This follows Barnaby’s reported comments that he claimed to be doing it tough on his $211,000 parliamentary salary, when he called for Newstart payments to be raised.  

That very unconservative declaration has raised eyebrows, and concerned ScoMo, who reportedly reluctantly, allowed Barnaby to get some more credit after fielding the phone call from a random number. 

“Yeah, righto, but don’t go fucking downloading anymore apps or anything. You’ve got unlimited SMS’s, so do that with your time instead of getting bloody ringtones,” ScoMo was heard saying to Joyce this afternoon. 

Joyce then promised that he’d use the gigabytes seriously and responsibly, and proceeded to hand the phone back over to his friend.

Tacky Foot Tattoo Provides Historical Context To Messy Mid-Twenties Break Up

TEXT:

Betoota Riverland’s woman, Alex Dewany, only met her friend’s new love interest for a minute today, and while it wasn’t long enough to find out where she worked or what her name was, it was long enough for her to conclude she’d had a messy break-up that likely happened during her mid-twenties.

Speaking to The Advocate, Alex told our reporter that it was easy to figure it out, she just clocked a tacky tattoo on the girl’s foot and pieced together the puzzle from there.

“Well, to start with it said, ‘believe in yourself’ and was dated a few years ago”

“Then it also had tacky vines and other shit patterns around it that kind of made love hearts”

“You only get a tattoo like that if you’ve been dumped.”

“My gut says that she was in a long-term relationship with a guy, they started dating when they were young, she forgot who she was, he made her feel worthless and she just put up with it because she didn’t know any better”

“And when they broke up a veil was lifted, she got her old self back and vowed to never put anyone else’s feelings before her own” 

It’s believed that Alex’s friend, Tim, didn’t believe Alex’s analysis, saying that there was no way she could know all of that from a tattoo. 

But, as Alex told our reporter, it was completely true. Tim asked his new love interest about her tattoo and she repeated Alex’s analysis almost verbatim – the only thing Alex missed out was the ex-boyfriend’s name which was Alfonso.

Homemade Taco Night Not Conducive To Portion Control

A local man has cursed his girlfriend this evening after she made a delicious Mexican feast for their Friday night dinner. 

While it may seem like Hugh Merlo is the luckiest guy in the world, his girlfriend, Alice, should know that tacos are Hugh’s kryptonite and he’s incapable of implementing any kind of portion control.

“She should know better!” moaned a full-to-the-brim, Hugh, to The Advocate.

According to Hugh, Alice makes the best tacos out of anyone he knows, even better than his mum.

“I dunno how she does it, but they’re like crack to me”

“I know I should stop eating after the fourth, but I just can’t”

The Advocate can confirm that on this particular occasion, Hugh managed to eat 10 tacos – the entire serving of soft tacos in the Old El Paso taco kit.

“Yeah… it’s a PB for me,” he said while shifting in his seat and taking a deep laboured breath.

Our reporter asked Alice whether she felt responsible for Hugh’s obvious discomfort, but she quickly shut down that line of questioning.

“Absolutely not. He’s an adult, I manage to eat a normal amount, so he can learn too.” 

While Alice appears to be standing strong on her innocence in this scenario, Hugh’s rampant weight gain might make her reconsider the point of view.

Local “Morning Person” Needs To Grow Up

Hannah Milcroft has basically had a gong rung in her ears this morning after her friend, Jen Logan, came bouncing towards her at full noise before 8:00am and before Hannah was even half way through her coffee.

“Hey Jen” Hannah said blatantly aggressively.

“See this cup? See how it says, ‘not fucking ready yet’?” she said while pointing to a helpful scale on the side of her coffee mug that’s used to indicate what level of tolerance the drinker is at.

“So, can you just take it down a notch. Thanks.”

After finishing her coffee and fully waking up, Hannah reached out to The Advocate to discuss the morning’s incident.

“Jesus Christ. I could have killed her this morning”

“No one’s matching her energy, take the hint”

“Jen, and every other morning person, just needs to fucking grow up.”

It’s believed that Hannah isn’t alone in her disdain for morning people, with a recent study done by the Australian Bureau of Statistics revealing that 80% of night owl’s wish morning people would just fucking not.

While it’s inevitable for some people to be morning people, what’s within their control is how annoying they are.

Mr. Woods, the statistician who ran the study, said that morning people can make a choice to be considerate between the hours of 06:00 – 10:00, and that they don’t actually have to be annoying.

“Yes, it’s a choice they can make. Just how they choose to get up and Instagram the sunrise for the 5th morning in a row, they can choose not to shove it in everyone’s face.”

Woman Who Just Watched Ozark Suspects Eternally Empty Kebab Shop Is A Money-Laundering Front

TEXT:

Leisa Wentworth had an epiphany as she walked past an empty Abdul’s Village Delight on New Beach Road this evening.

Leisa informed The Advocate that Abdul’s was not a kebab shop at all, but rather a criminal’s clever money laundering business.

“Yep. You heard me. It’s always empty, there’s no way they could afford the rent. There’s no other explanation,” she said with conviction.

Leisa’s bold claim follows her finishing the first season of Netflix’s hit crime drama web television series, Ozark.

The show’s premise sees economic advisor, Marty Byrde, relocate his family from Chicago to the summer resort community of Osage Beach, Missouri, after a failed money laundering scheme. Only to find himself setting up an even bigger laundering operation in the Ozarks.

“I see them everywhere now! I know.”

“How can I see them for what they are, and cops can’t?”

“I reckon they need to watch Ozark too,” she suggested.  

When asked whether she would go to the police with her suspicions, she admitted that she probably didn’t have enough evidence to make anything stick.

“Plus, I’m not a snitch. I don’t want to make any enemies, if you know what I mean.”

Substitute Music Teacher Wastes 5 Minutes Of Everyone’s Life By Setting Homework

A fast and loose lesson of year 9 music came to an unceremonious end earlier today as substitute teacher, Mr Chadwick (26), wasted five minutes of everyone’s life by setting homework.

After 50 minutes of telling kids to put the guitars back and stop playing music on their phone, the green music sub called for silence and begun outlining the homework he wanted completed before the next class that he may or may not be teaching.

“Write this down, it’s important,” lied Chadwick.

“Please.”

Although Mr Chadwich is the teacher, many of the students state he is the one with a lot to learn if he’s going to continue teaching without having a nervous breakdown.

“You can tell he’s new,” stated one student.

Local Woman Offers Solution To Friend’s Problem That Isn’t Water Or Exercise

A local woman has surprised her friends by listening to their problems and then responding with an unorthodox piece of advice – one that had nothing to do with drinking more water or exercising.

“I was pretty surprised,” Kendra Smith told The Advocate.

“Up till now, her advice had been pretty shit. But then she came out of left field with a suggestion that might actually be helpful.”

Alice Patterson, a Sydney-based yoga instructor, is a sweet girl but not one that her friends usually expect good counsel from.

“One time I told her I was going through a breakup and then for hours she wouldn’t shut up about ‘toxins’ and how I needed to either sweat them or flush them out,” Smith told reporters.

But this time things were different. Smith, half-expecting another lecture about hydration or endorphins, told Patterson she was contemplating a career change.

“She said, ‘go for it.’” I was shocked.” Smith told reporters. “I mean, sure, she followed it up by telling me to make sure to leave time to hit the gym, but still, it was a big step.”

Local Man Faces Daily Choice Between Knowing What’s Going On In The World And Being Happy

The 23-year-old barista from Brisbane wakes up each morning and deliberates.

“Take today, for example,” Guthrie told The Advocate, “I was reading the news on my phone and I came across an article about the alarming rate at which the arctic permafrost is melting and the adverse effect that will have on our rapidly warming planet. Instead of reading it, I made eggs.”

He doesn’t always make the same choice though. Just last week he read an in-depth account of the deplorable conditions refugees are being kept in by the Australian government at the immigration detention centres. 

“I’m not going to say I regret making that decision,” Guthrie told reporters. 

“But let’s just say, I didn’t make any eggs that day.”

What choice will he make tomorrow? Only time will tell.

“You never know whether you’re going to have an informed day or a happy day until it’s happening,” Guthrie said.

For local on-the-spot fintech entrepreneur turned magnate, Johnny (39, Betoota Grove) the idea of getting away to Europe during the Australian winter months is something that he knows will upset a lot of his clients.

That’s because his start up offers 24-hour email responses with a 45 minute response time after midnight. 

But, like many other deep-Gen-Y corporate-creatives, Johnny knows he’s gotta make the most of the freedom that comes with being young and single.

“I’ve got a few mates who’ve married up, and they can’t do the quick two weeks in Europe anymore” he tells our reporters.

“So, I figure, if not now, then when?”

For Johnny, work takes up a lot of his time, and with his intern currently completing an online course on Xero – his company’s extremely fraudulent tax return should be lodged by about this time on Friday. At which point he plans to be boarding a Scoot airline to Singapore, before another one takes him to a random airport just 15 kilometres outside of Bolgna.

“Haha. I’ve tried to tell as many clients as I can. Just so they don’t get pissed off if they see my Insta stories” says Johnny.

“Most of them are probably doing the same thing. Haha. But yeah, don’t want any of them sending emails through to me for the next few weeks because they’ll be going straight to the keeper”

“I Have A Headache” Says Mate Who Drinks 1.25L Of Coke Every Smoko

Local construction worker Lesley Scott (38) is reported to be complaining about a headache again during a busy work day.

As his colleagues rush to finish the construction of a building that will need to be evacuated in five years due to structural faults, Scott claims he has a stress related migraine. 

His colleagues however say stress has nothing to do with Scott’s headache and that it may actually be related to the 1.25L bottle of Coke Scott drinks every smoko.

“I don’t drink a 1.25L bottle every smoko,” stated an irate Scott.

“Sometimes the 2L bottles are on special for half the price of normal bottles, I’m not stupid.”

Scott states that his cola consumption is not what is giving him a headache and is actually a good way for him to stay caffeinated and hydrated.

“Plus, if I don’t have it I get cranky and my hands start shaking a bit.”

Aside from the headaches, medical professionals such as Scott’s long suffering dentist state there are long term effects associated with his daily Coke consumption that could effectively be measured in litres.

“He has the only smile I’ve seen that could be improved by losing a couple of teeth.”

Not worried about fussy opinions from medical professionals, Scott maintains that his headaches are stress related, demanding more time for him to hydrate with a carbonated black beverage humans are less attune to drinking than alcohol.

Jasmine Hawkinson has surprised her boyfriend today with acting skills he didn’t know she had. 

The talent was discovered when her boyfriend, Jim, proposed to her. 

While a proposal is usually cause for surprise, in this instance the fact that Jasmine chose the ring completely negates the surprise.

The Advocate sat down with the young couple shortly after the proposal to gain a little more detail around the momentous occasion.

“Yeah, it went really well,” said Jim, looking to Jasmine for reassurance, who reassured him but then excused herself from the interview to use the ladies room.

“What really surprised me was Jas’s acting skills” Jim said candidly once Jasmine was out of earshot.

“She chose the ring the weekend before, then gave me a 1 week window of when to propose”

“She knew it was coming but reacted like it was completely unexpected.”

“It was scary,” he said quickly before Jasmine returned.

Friend Request From Weirdo At Work Stays On The Backburner For Another Week

Steph Lidcome has today let her finger hover over the accept button of a friend request that she’s been avoiding before deciding she’d let it hang until next time. 

The friend request in question is one from Oli Elliot, a colleague of Steph’s that she has barely spoken to in the two years she’s been at her company. 

The Advocate sat down with Steph to see why she’s continued to leave Oli on the back burner for what’s now the 5th week. 

“Umm I just don’t know him” 

“He added me on Facebook too, not even Linked in” 

“Facebook is for friends. If I haven’t been drunk with you at least 4 times, I’m not going to accept you on Facebook.”

While Steph’s friend accepting criteria might seem trivial, social media analysts based in Betoota have data to back up her hierarchy.

“Yes, she’s bang on. It’s kind of like bases, if you will,” said Mr. Fox, lead data analyst at Social Miners, Betoota’s biggest data analysis agency.  

“Linked In is the network for pure colleagues, then if the relationship progresses Instagram is next, then Facebook”

“For Oli to jump straight to Facebook is borderline sociopathic.”

Zero Alcohol Mistaken For Zero Carbs

TEXT:

A local big fella has had the wind very much taken out of his sails this evening. 

Turning up to a friend’s house for the all important Origin Decider, Gordon Hodges thought he would be received like a hero when he waltzed through the door with a case of piss. 

However, much to his surprise and shock, the young man was greeted by an outburst of a laughter and a barrage of criticism. 

This came after he walked in with a case of Carlton Zeros, in what was a case of his wires crossing in a very unfortunate way. 

“Yeah, I fucked up,” he sighed to us after the laughter subsided amongst his friendship group. 

“I though Carlton Zero were zero Carbs, like Coke Zero, or Sprite Zero.” 

“Obviously I’ve just learnt they are zero alcohol. Which is very frustrating.” 

“What a debacle. When I saw how cheap they were I thought it must have been an Origin special of something. Like everything in life though I guess, when it seems too good to be true, it is.” 

In the aftermath, Hodges’s mates have refused to let him have any of their Betoota Bitter’s, in what seems to be a cruel joke which Hodges is hoping they will let up on. 

“I’ve learnt my lesson, every time you see a cheap case, check the terms and conditions and do your research,” he said. 

Do you like drinking beer that has alcohol in it? Well, save yourself the hassle of heading to the shops and grab a case of Betoota Bitter online today.  Click here.

Faint Rustle of Chewing Gum Packet Attracts Local Vultures

TEXT:

One seemingly innocuous action by a local teacher today named Alicia Watson has caused the biggest stir down in a Betoota Heights school staffroom since the principal got caught stealing other people’s lunches. 

The young secondary teacher did so a short time ago when she decided to treat her hungover palette to a piece of Extra gum to take the edge of what tasted like a she’d eaten dirt mixed with sweet and sour sauce in last night. 

Foolishly failing to see the potential ramifications of her actions, she pulled the new pack of Extra Soft Chew from her bag, unconcealed in broad daylight, and was immediately set upon by the vultures in the staff room. 

After the slight rustling noise alerted their attention, she was greeted by a barrage of outstretched hands hoping to scab a piece of chewy, in what is a fairly common example of the predatory behaviour displayed by most Australians from the age of 2 and up. 

In what can be expected in the schoolyard amongst her pupils, the history teacher who just ran a train wreck of a science class because no casuals were available today, was forced to hand out the majority of her packet to her fellow staff members. 

Already struggling with the day at hand following a spontaneous happy hour raid on a popular French Quarter bar last night, Watson said she didn’t have the mental fortitude to berate the usual culprits for their leeching of her gum. 

“There are two types of people in this world,” sighed Watson. 

“The people who get their round on cue, and the people who have to be reminded that it is, in fact, their round. The people who turn up to a BBQ with nothing, and the people that show up with some steaks, sausos and a salad. The people who buy chewy when they are at the shops, and the people who always want a bit of chewy, but never buy it.” 

“To all your readers out there, I would urge them to be the first person, to be the best person they can be.” 

Watson then explained that she had Year 9 History next and she couldn’t talk to us anymore. 

“I need to find everything within me to try and work myself up for the rabble of little shits. They are the volatile combination of being an unbearable age and having as little interest in the subject matter as a reserve grade footballer does in going straight home after the game for a quiet dinner with his family.”

“This isn’t going to be an enjoyable 50 minutes of my life.”

Anxious Local Man Spends Entire Gator Thriller Living In Fear Of Phone Somehow Turning On, Ringing

TEXT:

A jittery local boyfriend has spent the
entirety of the last two hours on the edge of his seat. 

Not because of the content within the movie he
signed up to go and see with his girlfriend, but because of the phone burning a
hole in his pocket. 

Despite turning his phone off, and checking it
was off on four separate occasions before the movie CRAWL even got rolling,
young Ainsley Sampson couldn’t wash the fear from his brain. 

Speaking to us after walking out of the movie
theatre in Betoota Heights, Sampson said he’s just let out a sigh of relief. 

“Fuck me. That was a couple of anxious hours.
All the Gators coming out of nowhere and ripping shit to pieces paired with
lingering fear in the back of my mind that my phone might somehow turn on and
ring even though it’s on silent 24/7 had me twitching,” he laughed. 

“I should just leave the fucken thing (the
phone) at home next time. It makes me as anxious as an existential Sunday night
toss and turn after a big weekend of doing questionable things.” 

This comes after a report was released by the
CSIRO, Australia’s most respected scientific body by everyone except the
treasury, confirmed that 77% of movie attendees live in fear of their phone
going off for some reason. 

“To be fair,” said young Sampson. 

“I was once abused by a large man with tattoos
when I was younger for my phone going off during a very important scene in a
movie, so I have a reason to be scared.” 

“Anyway it’s over now. Movie was great. Large Popcorn was great. Choc Top was great as always. Until next time,” he said walking off into the night. 

The movie in question the young man saw was Crawl and is in Cinemas July 11.

Mum Under Impression That Fruit And Nut Chocolate Is ‘Healthier’

TEXT:

A local mum who is trying her best has today brought home two bars of  Fruit and Nut chocolate. 

Jennifer Agassi, the mum of three, saw the chocolate on special at Franklins and thought she might treat her adult children to a healthier alternative to their usual trip down to the Betoota Waters gelato bar near their house.

While eating small pieces of chocolate filled with fruit and nuts might seem like it’s healthier, Jen’s first-born child was pretty quick to inform her mother that if anything, there was more sugar in the bar.

“Mum, are you serious?” questioned Tash.

“It’s regular chocolate, which isn’t good for you, and they’ve added sweetened dried fruit, which is 100% sugar”

“It’s sugar on sugar”

It’s believed Jennifer didn’t quite know how to handle the truth being dropped on her, and like anyone who’s been mislead by big business, wanted answers.

“What? Far out Tash, next thing you’ll be trying to tell me that my Weight Watchers cookies are bad for me too!”

Jennifer’s ignorance about the healthiness of food is not unique to her, with the Australian government recently declaring the nation’s obesity a fast approaching epidemic.

As we reported last month, the CSIRO has found that the simplest solution to curbing the number of overweight people in the country could be teaching people how to read.

“Gotta Go, I’m Getting Into A Lift” Says Man That Hasn’t Moved For Three Hours

Our reporter may have discovered the smartest way to end a phone call that’s ever existed.

“Sorry to cut this short but I’m just getting into a lift, do you want me to call you back after? Nup? Ok, no dramas,” said the man sitting on the bench.

Our reporters spoke to the man to see what sparked the ingenious wrap-up and whether it is an original idea.

“Mate, I’ve been using it for years” said Brett Rhylie.

“You can end any conversation whenever you want and not seem like a dickhead”

“That one you just heard? That was my grandma calling me.”

“You know how they are, always up for a chat, but sometimes you just gotta end it”

“This way no one gets hurt.”

“Anyway, feel free to use that one. Cheers for the chat but I gotta go, you caught me as I was just about to leave, there’s my bus!”

Brett quickly got up from where he was sitting and ran out the door to the bus stop, disappearing behind the bus. 

But as the bus drove away, Brett was still there.

Local Woman’s Impulsive Purchase Of New Planning Diary Solves Everything

TEXT:

Just over a week into Dry July, Emily Richmond, has discovered a new lease on life that has seen her find ambition and motivation that was previously buried deep below a fortress built on rosé and tequila.

While still in a crippling amount of Afterpay debt, being behind on her phone bill and eating baked beans on cruskits for lunch, her impulsive purchase of a new leather-bound planning diary might just put this all behind her.

The Advocate sat down with Emily shortly after she purchased the diary to talk about just how much of a difference a small pad of paper can make.

“I didn’t plan on buying a new diary, but I’m already feeling more productive and like I’ve got my shit together.”

“It’s already making a huge difference, look, I’ve made a to-do list”

Emily’s first to-do list wasn’t very ambitious, it mostly comprised of house hold chores, meeting up with friends for coffee and reminders to call her mum.

“I read an article somewhere the other day that said successful people make lists, so that’s what I do now.”

It seems that despite Emily’s best intentions, she too, like many before her, might fall prey to the impulsive band-aid solution of the planning diary.

According to Officeworks, 70% of the planners they sell actually end up being recycled into lamp bases at hipster cafes – it’s so common in fact that they’ve added a bin out the front of their stores where people can return unused diaries.

We’ve set up a CCTV camera at the French Quarter store to see if Emily returns hers.

Anti Social Relationship With Alcohol Laughed Off With Drunk Alter Ego

TEXT:

A local woman has completely rid herself of any responsibility for her actions last night after she revealed it wasn’t her that abused her brother’s new girlfriend, but rather her drunk alter-ego. 

Tamara Phale, or Tash when she’s drunk, went on an absolute tear last night following a long lunch with the girls at a Betoota Harbour waterfront restaurant. 

Nursing a throbbing headache, Tamara sat down with The Advocate to relive last night’s events.

“HA! Did she really get abused?”

“Man, I’ve got to stop drinking rosé, I can’t control Tash on the rosé”

“Oh btw, Tash is my drunk alter-ego. She’s crazy.”

When questioned further about ‘Tash’, Tamara revealed that she only really comes out when she (Tamara) drinks copious amounts of rosé.

“Yeah, it’s a bit of a problem really. My boyfriend has banned me from drinking it, but I still sneak it when he’s away on work trips.”

While Tamara is laughing off her drunk alter-ego, a slightly more concerning matter is at play – Tamara may have broken up her Tim, her brother, and his new girlfriend.

Further reports from the night state that the girlfriend left the Betoota Imperial Hotel in tears, with a frustrated Tim racing after her.

It remains unclear whether they’re still together or what the ramifications for Tamara will be, if she sticks true to form it’s likely she’ll neck a bottle of rosé and let Tash deal with it.

Anti-Vaxxer Parents Warp Life Expectancy Statistics By Counting Child’s Age In Dog Years

TEXT:

Some residents of the Northern Rivers of NSW have today figured out how to game the system. 

Daisy and Luke Watersmith from the bohemian region revealed an incredible trick they’ve been using to improve life expectancy. 

Rather than vaccinate their children and protect them and the community from a raft of diseases and illnesses, the two ex-creatives from Brisbane’s West End have instead decided to begin measuring their child’s age in dog years. 

“Pretty clever hey?” said a very pleased with himself Luke Watersmith tending to the communal garden out the back of his house. 

“So basically, every calendar year little Aquarius and Arsha get through, counts as 7, because we are counting them in dog years!” 

“So really Aquarius is almost a third of the way there at 4 normal years, and 28 dog years.” 

“It’s a really exciting innovation we are hoping to share with the other non-sheeple around here.” 

“Because, instead of not gambling with out children’s lives to pursue some ideological battle were emotionally invested in because things have been to good in this country for too long, we are just going to do things are own way.” 

“Which is what we like doing anyway,” he laughed. 

“So there you go.”

Sleep Deprived Man Eats Entire Bowl Of Sugar Without Even Realising It Wasnt His Normal Cereal

TEXT:

In a somewhat sad story breaking out of our town’s Heights district this morning, a docile local bachelor has consumed nearly 250 grams of sugar before 9 o’clock this morning. 

The bizarre incident occurred earlier today when the young man accidentally filled his entire bowl up with sugar instead of his normal breakfast cereal.

After a late night watching England manage to dislodge the object from their throat in the Cricket World Cup, Toby Bright was trudging around his share house kitchen getting himself ready for the day when he made the mistake. 

However, rather than fix his mistake, poor Bright admitted after the fact that he didn’t even realise he had eaten nearly two weeks worth of sugar in one hit. 

“I didn’t even realise that it wasn’t my normal cereal,” sighed Bright. 

“I just thought it was my normal breakfast but maybe it had gone soggy over time and it had lost it’s crunch a bit.” 

“But yeah, I was eating pure sugar.” 

Bright then explained that it was an easy mistake to make. 

“I mean it tasted exactly the same as my normal breakfast cereal that I’ve eaten since a kid and probably had the same nutritional value as well.” 

“Makes you wonder if a bowl of sugar could get a 2.5 Health Stars rating  too?” 

Bright then told our reporters he had to get back to work as the normal spike from his breakfast was about to taper off and he need to get something out of it before spending an hour pushing paper around and thinking about what he was going to have for lunch.

‘Love It Or Leave’ Says Man Who Regularly Tells People He Hates What Australia’s Become

TEXT:

A local retiree from our town’s Betoota Grove has again taken to social media today to let his 56 Facebook friends (who are mostly relatives and fake accounts) that he is disgusted at what has become of the country he once loved. 

Incensed for the third time already this week by the Israel Folau saga, Bryan Wilson vented on social media about what he perceives as the death of freedom of speech in this country. 

His status about his growing hatred for this country comes only three poorly made memes after he told everyone who doesn’t love Australia, that they should leave it. 

Wilson, a 72-year-old retired accountant explained to The Advocate this afternoon that he’s just about had enough. 

“I don’t know how much more of this I can take,” he sighed from his backyard. 

“Don’t mistake that however for an admission that I won’t fight for this beautiful country though,” he said in some vague implication that he’ll keep posting memes and aggressive statuses on Facebook and lecturing his grandkids about how brainwashed they’ve become. 

“We used to be the lucky country you know. Until we gave in to the left week ideological dictatorship and handed over our country to the PC police.” 

“Thank god we’ve got Miranda (Devine) and Andrew (Bolt) still fighting the good fight,” explained the owner of 4 negatively geared properties in town which he uses as a moral justification to call people under the age of 30 who don’t own a home lazy. 

“Because I’m scared for the future of this country,” said the boomer who doesn’t believe in climate change.

Employees Forced To Appreciate Boss’s Meme

TEXT:

In the ever coarsening of the daily grind, employees of Bush Catering were forced to appreciate a meme shared on their mandatory internal communications system.

The reason for the forced appreciation was due to the fact that the below average meme was created by their boss.

Without one successful high five to his name, general manager Alan Bush (52) has tried his hand at making some memes in order to foster a friendship with the employees he yells at for not doing their minimum wage job properly.

The meme in question featured a more well known culinary wanker, Masterchef host George Calambaris holding a card that reads ‘11/10’ with text that reads ‘Customers when we bring out our homemade spring rolls.’

“Did you get it?” asked Bush for roughly the fifth time.

“Could we post this on the company Facebook page?”

The majority of Bush’s employees state they have given their boss honest feedback before but in this case, it is far easier to just fake interest in his subpar meme.

“He used the Impact font top text, bottom text format,” stated employee Grace Caldwell.

“He sent it to us, then came round and showed all of us on his phone to ‘see us LOL IRL.’”

“Stop Buying Avocado Toast” Says Boomer With Personalised Number Plates

TEXT:

The decomposing dead horse of jokes about avocados and homeownership continues to be beaten into the cold, wintery earth with vigour as newsagent Keith Quigley (65) weighs in on his children’s spending habits.

According to Quigley, his adult children can’t afford to purchase a house as they are frivolous with their money, choosing to spend it on weekend breakfast foods instead of putting it towards at $25,000 home like he did.

“Why would you pay $18 for something that cost $6 to make?” asked Quigley, who as a business owner should understand how profits work.

“Stupid is what it is.”

It appears that Quigley’s barefoot level of knowledge on the subject is at odds with his own lifestyle as it has been revealed he is the owner of a personalised number plate.

“Yeah, but I bought them for life, it’s an investment. I can put these on any car I buy after this, I’m not stupid.” 

The number plates in question, are limited edition ‘Plate of Origin’ number plates with the Queensland State of Origin logo and customised letters that read ‘6NA ROW.’

“Still highly sort after, there’s only one of these around. Would fetch a good price considering.”

Despite his questionable financial record, Quigley maintains a once a week spend on bodily sustenance is far worse than dropping hundreds on two pieces of metal that lets other drivers know you will not be indicating correctly.

“I’m A Big Kid At Heart” Says Grown Man Who Sleeps In A Single Bed

TEXT:

In breaking news, it has been revealed that local unit Nick ‘Kingo’ King refers to himself as a ‘big kid at heart’ primarily for the reason that he sleeps in a single bed.

The 36-year-old plumber is known for his workplace antics and ability to do anything in order to get attention under the guise that he is trying to boost morale amongst his fellow employees.

After giving himself alcohol poisoning following the proud tradition of ‘Friday Drinks,’ co-worker Heather Grant (30) made sure King returned home safe, in the same way you wouldn’t allow a child to walk home at night. 

Upon entering King’s apartment, Grant immediately identified her co-worker’s single bed as the root cause for his behaviour.

“It all makes sense now,” stated Grant.

“If you slept in a bed designed for children and virgins then life might be easier to deal with if you thought of yourself as some sort of overgrown child.”

Grant lay him to rest on the mattress too short to accommodate his feet before stepping over a pile of unopened mail, returning home and having 19 showers.

“It would be sweet if it wasn’t the most pathetic thing I’d ever seen.”

Enjoying a bowl of Coco Pops in bed the following morning, King discussed how his alcohol issues and porn addiction and are just part of his boisterous childlike charm and not something you need to call his brother about to discuss.

“I’m just a big kid! And my last name is King, so no matter what, this is a KING SINGLE! Haha!”

Advertising Agency Makes Up For Not Paying Overtime By Installing Sparkling Water On Tap

TEXT:

One of Betoota’s top advertising agencies, TBJUQS/Smith, has successfully tricked its employees into thinking they’re not being overworked and underpaid by having a sparkling water tap installed alongside their regular cold and hot filtered water tap.

Having been installed last night, the hysteria in the office today can apparently rival that caused by the visit of Princess Diana back before the turn of the century. 

After hearing about the installation back at The Advocate, our reporter reached out the agency’s managing director to discuss the clever sleight of hand carried out last night.

“It’s worked far better than we expected” said June Ross, TBJUQS/Smith MD.

“There’s a young team here who have been working until 11pm every night this week”

“This morning when they heard about the fancy [sic] tap, their slavish work week was all but forgotten”

“We haven’t seen a buzz in the agency like this since we bought a ping pong table!”

It’s not yet known how long the sparkling wave will roll, but the agency plans on capitalising on their employees’ high spirits while they can, as Ms. Ross explained.

“We’ve actually doubled everyone’s work load without them knowing”

“Hopefully the novelty of sparkling water on tap lasts long enough for everyone to meet these unrealistic deadlines haha [sic].”

Local Woman Makes Monumental Mistake Of Asking Gym Instructor What Kind Of Music He’s Into

TEXT:

Local HR representative Sophie Mackay’s winter body has met its biggest hurdle yet this afternoon.

This comes as the 26-year-old Betoota Grove woman made the colossal fuck up of attempting to engage her gym instructor with non-heath and fitness related conversation.

“I should have known” she told our reporters.

“He has a Carpe Diem tattoo across in shoulders in Old English. Of course this was going to end badly”

Complete with a sharply faded Peaky Blinders haircut, Wayde is Sophie’s go-to source for advice of weights training. She’s since learnt that she probably left it at just that.

While the kinda-happily-single white collar professional refuses to disclose whether this mistake was made out of romantic water-testing, she does admit that their most recent conversation has ruled Wayde out for eternity.

“He was talking about how he got into weights training while working on his ‘festival bod’ for Stereosonic” she says.

“So, in a lapse of protocol, I asked him what kind of music he’s into”

Within minutes, Wayde had hijacked the gym’s sound system and was playing that Solardo Remix of FISHER’s seminal 2017 dance ballad ‘Ya Kidding’.

“It was so loud” she says.

While Sophie acknowledges that she shouldn’t criticise Wayde for things that make him happy, she says the real issue was the fact that he was playing it to her and visibly seeking her approval.

“Now everyone in that gym thinks I’m the type of person that makes song requests”

“And they think that we share the same love of Australian Bro House”

At time of press, the Betoota Grove AllDaTime Fitness gym was overcome by the dulcet tones of The Bloody Beetroots ft Steve Aoki.

“One two! Woop Woop!” shouts Wayde while fist-pumping.

It’s believed Belle hadn’t really met much of Bill’s extended family, so although a sad occasion, it was her chance to impress her future family in-law. It was going well until Belle arrived at the wake and had a couple glasses of champagne to build up her courage to mingle.

“Immediately after I said it I wanted to take it back, it was like everything went it slow motion”

Sitting down with The Advocate, Belle explained the events surrounding the moment she asked Bill’s aunt, the late Sandrine’s daughter, how things have been.

“She just scowled at me and then burst into tears”

“What was I thinking?”

“Her mum had just died, of course things haven’t been going well.”

“I tried to backtrack, but it was too late, she was pretty good about it though. Well, as good as anyone can be at the wake of their mother.”

Despite thinking she might get away with reminding a mourning daughter that her mum had just died, The Advocate can confirm that the Smith family isn’t taking it so well. 

Bill’s aunt has reportedly put an irreversible strike through Belle and is lobbying other family members to turn on her too.

Christian School Introduces ‘No Gender, No Play’ Rule

TEXT:

With Scott Morrison now locked in as Prime Minister until the Libspill pencilled in for 2021, a local Christian school has felt empowered to introduce a controversial ‘No Gender, No Play’ rule during lunchtime. 

Saint Augustine of Damascus Primary School implemented the playground rule in an effort to stop a small percentage of children from expressing their inner selves at least until they hit university.

Since the introduction of the rule, children who do not identify as the gender on their birth certificate must remain seated in the shade next to the hatless and those that ran on the tar.

At the time of writing, the rule has been in effect for one week and has been discussed for 119 total hours on morning TV.

“Whatever happened to playing with sticks?” asked a Sunrise guest who would much rather have been invited to speak about anything else. 

“Can’t we just let kids be straight kids?”

Principle of S.A.D. Primary Fiona Morris states this is the type of rules parents want to keep their children safe from questioning the teachings of the church.

“We make it very clear to the kids, the only men who get to wear dresses are priests.”

Vague Commitment To Go To The Gym This Week Justifies Mid Arvo Servo Snack

“What’s wrong with a cheeky little Maxibon pick me up, I’ve been keen to have a run at the new Double Handle as well,” he said to us walking out of the servo.

Meet The Young Parents Who Halved Their Family’s Sugar Intake By Learning How To Read

In breaking news, The Advocate has found a family who’ve managed to halve their sugar intake without spending thousands on a nutritionist or a dietician. 

Excitingly, Beverley Arthur, mother of Jake, Tyson and Emeelee, says that it’s something anyone can do.

“You won’t believe it, but it’s so easy to tell if a product is full of sugar or not”

“You literally have to just read the packet”

“I can’t believe no one has told people this before”

“You see on the news that all these groups are blowing up because businesses are making their product packaging look healthy, like putting apples on there.”

“But that’s not really the problem, it’s the idiots not reading the packet, I know that now.”

“And I’m allowed to call them idiots because I used to be one.”

This discovery has come at quite a fortuitous time for the Fast Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) industry after the Public Health Prevention Conference all but declared war on the industry in a bid to stop Australians being such fatties.

Ex-Smoker Experiences Wave Of Nostalgia Walking Past Ventilation Shutters Of Local Pokie Den

TEXT:

Damien (Damo) Molloy took a deep and considered breath through his nose this morning as he walked past the ventilation shutters of the pokie den at the Betoota Imperial Hotel. 

This goes against the grain of every other passer-by, who are usually seen holding their breath.

Damo quit smoking two months ago as he embarked on his self-imposed ‘glow-up’ journey. 

Sitting down with The Advocate, Damo reflected on the overwhelming wave of nostalgia that washed over him as he sniffed the toxic air.

“It just made me miss it, you know?”

“Sitting out there, feeding pineapples into those reverse ATMs.”

“Breathing in whatever that air deodorizer is”

“You know, the one they pump into the pokie room to mask the smell of smoke and desperation,” Damo said, gazing longingly into his memories of a sweeter time.

When asked whether it made him miss it enough to drop out of his rags to rigness story, Damo made it very clear that he was not going to quit, not even for one more dart and slap in the VIP room.

“No way, I’ve already made a Facebook event,”

“I’m going to hire a projector and project my before pictures on a sheet hanging on the clothes line, then run through them to reveal my new self to all my friends”

“It’ll be sick, hopefully everyone can see the difference otherwise this will all be for nothing.”

A quick survey of Damo’s friends revealed that just two months in they can already notice a huge difference in Damo’s appearance, they’re eager for his glow up party at the end of this month.

Report: Eccentric Loudmouth Walking Down Plane Aisle Coming Straight For Seat Next To You

TEXT:

A local atheist has found herself this afternoon praying to god that the man making his way down the aeroplane aisle, isn’t coming for the spare seat next to her.

“God, please no!” Anne Small thought to herself, or maybe she said it out aloud, she can’t be sure.

Although trying to play it cool and pretend she doesn’t care if someone takes the seat next to her, Anne was actually staring directly at the eccentric loudmouth trouncing right for her.

She was unable to look away.

Second by second, he got closer, each step he took seemingly ramping up Anne’s anxiety levels.

Unbeknownst to her, Anne had actually begun holding her breath as she waited to see where the loud mouth was going to plonk himself.

She looked at the man, then to her seat, then back to the man, he was basically on top of her now he was that close. 

The man looked up at the seat number and checked it against his ticket.

“Ah, nope, I’m 26A, next one.” He said to himself.

Anne let out a huge sigh of relief.

She wasn’t out of the woods yet though, the doors of the plane were still open, and as everyone knows, there are no certainties until the plane is in the air.

Her Betoota Airways flight is due to depart in 10 minutes, we’ll keep an eye on this developing story.

Local Man Attempts To Mask Rampant Weight Gain With Strong Goatee

TEXT:

Local man Steve Hooper came to a confronting realisation this morning after his attempts at hiding his rampant weight gain have failed. 

For the past two months, Steve has been desperately trying to hide his ever-tubbing face with facial hair, however, his poor genetics let him down there too, by only producing a mere whisper of a goatee.

A heavy Steve sat down with The Advocate to share his story and talk about how he found out his cover up plan failed.

“I found out when my sister flat out told me”

“She goes, ‘Stevie, that piss-weak excuse for a goatee isn’t hiding any of those chins you’ve grown. Stop eating tinned-spaghetti meat pies and go to the gym once in a while if you want to get rid of them’ it was fucking brutal”

“But fair, I guess.” He said while gently caressing his hairy chins.

“I’m not sure I want to give up the pies though, I reckon this hair thing might come through with the goods”

“I’ve started taking Rogaine, I can already notice I’m getting more hair”

“Given it’s on my nipples and head, but I reckon it’s just filtering through my system, it’ll hit the face soon.”

With Steve only being a month into his Rogaine course, the outcome of his plan isn’t yet clear. 

As far as Rogaine success stories go though, it might be a better option for him to take his sister’s advice and stop eating tinned spaghetti pies.

Local Woman Transitions Into Late 30s By Making LinkedIn Her Social Media Platform Of Choice

TEXT:

Former young woman, Beth Smith, has today begun her transition into being old by doing away with youthful social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook, and instead opting for LinkedIn, the online CV site that has somehow become Facebook for ageing professionals.

It’s believed Beth wasn’t even aware that she’d made LinkedIn her preferred platform, revealing to The Advocate that her use gradually increased until one day she realised she was checking it as soon as she woke up in the morning.

“I used to just check it if I was bored and had refreshed every other platform a million times”

“Now I’m addicted to it”

“It’s so weird, it’s like an episode of Black Mirror”

“No one is their true self, people comment in this weird, uplifting, professional tone that is just not who they are in real life”

“I used to do it ironically, but now it’s just normal”

“I find the way people talk on Instagram so juvenile, with all their fire emoji’s and yass [sic] queen talk,” she finished with a shiver. 

Since being founded in 2002, LinkedIn has transformed from an employment service to a full-on professional networking service.

According to a usage study, over 90% of LinkedIn users are over 30, making it the perfect platform for older people.

Before leaving the interview, Beth said that she was particularly excited about the week ahead on LinkedIn because she was about to announce her promotion. We’ll report on Beth’s traction once it is live.

Local Woman’s Card Blocked After Suspicious Non-Coffee Or Afterpay Related Spending

TEXT:

A local woman’s bank has stepped in today and put a block on her debit card for fear of it being scammed by someone from West Betoota. 

However, The Advocate can confirm that Penny Oneill’s card was not stolen or scammed but being used recklessly by Penny herself.

The block came after Penny made a number of large withdrawals; $300 at a single ATM, $150 at McDonald’s, $174.65 in total at a Betoota bar and then another $40 on a taxi ride at 4:00 am in the morning.

Any human can see that there’s a pattern to this spending, but for the Bank of Betoota’s computer algorithm it was completely out of character and so it triggered a blockage.

It’s believed that Penny then had to call her bank and explain to them that he card wasn’t scammed, she had just been on a bender.

“Uh, yeah, those transactions were all me,” she said to the customer service representative based in Manila.

“I went on a bit of a tear on the weekend”

“Yep, the $150 at McDonald’s was me too, I shouted everyone in the store” she sheepishly explained.

After reopening the wounds of Saturday night for ten minutes and explaining what a tear was, Penny had her card unblocked.

The Advocate understands that Penny has imposed a spending ban on herself until her next paycheque, which is another 23 days away.

Local Inner City Markets Facing Barrage Of Criticism For Distinct Lack Of Gözleme Stall

TEXT:

The organisers of Betoota’s famed French Quarter Markets are facing a wave of criticism after a glaring error this weekend. 

The French Quarter Markets, like others around the country are the highlight of the weekend for many of the nation’s inner city residents. 

However, organisers have been publicly called out and shamed for their decision to allow the markets to go ahead without a Gözleme stall on Saturday. 

This comes after a report was released just last week confirming that it is mandatory for any markets operating within 100 kilometres of a major city’s CBD to have a Gözleme stall with a minimum of two elderly women running the shop. 

“Absolutely disgraceful @FrenchQuarterMarkets… What’s next, no overpriced candle store?” wrote one angry patron online today. 

“So no Gözleme place on the weekend? How the fuck was that allowed to go ahead, not happy!” wrote another. 

The market’s coordinator confirmed to The Advocate that they had made the mistake, but wanted to assure residents and tourists that it would not happen again. 

“The two ladies who normally run the stall were away for the weekend and we foolishly forgot to organised a replacement from somewhere,” the coordinator said.

“It won’t happen again.” 

“We will be offering free pink turmeric spiced lemonade next weekend to make up for the mistake.”

‘Sorry Last Bit’ Says Mate Visibly Stashing Packet of Chewy Back Away

TEXT:

A local engineer has been caught out doing his best Sansa Stark impersonation and lying to the world at large today.

The incident occurred at around roughly 1:55 pm out the front of a popular cafe in the Betoota’s Old City District this afternoon, when a local man named Toby Hunt informed his friends that he didn’t have any chewing gum, despite leaving the servo less than an hour ago with a brand new packet. 

“Haha nah, last bit actually, sorry,” lied Hunt through his teeth after a couple of scavengers sought to grab a couple of little Extra bits off their friend. 

Facing the wrath of the friends he’d just finished a late pre-session lunch, Hunt then refused to reveal the packet of chewy he just put back into his bag for some reason. 

Hunt, who often uses the chewy to eradicate the effects of his onion heavy diet, then proceeded to fend off questions from the group. 

“Shame I don’t have any left guys sorry, it’s curiously soft, minty and cleansing,” he said riling them up even more. 

“We literally saw you put it back in your backpack. Why’d you put it back in your bag if the packet’s empty?” berated one friend. 

“There’s a bin right there,” said another. 

The young bachelor and engineer, who always plans ahead as is the case with most engineers, confirmed he desperately wanted to tell the rest of his mates that he wasn’t giving them any because they are leeches who suck things like chewy, ciggies, and data right out of him. 

But knowing he would have looked like a bit of a shit bloke, the seasoned veteran kept it to himself and battened down the hatches until the storm subsided. 

“It wouldn’t kill them to go and get some gum would it, Steve (one of the members of Hunt’s friendship circle) feeds lobsters into the pokies like he’s working for the NBN, so I don’t see why he can’t go and be the good bloke who buys and gives out chewy for once.” 

“Because I’m sick of being their bottomless chewy dispenser. It’s like a third of a schooner for a packet for Christ’s sake.”

Plans To Assassinate Girl Talking To Boyfriend Put On Hold After Discovering She Has A Husband

TEXT:

Cassie Melrose has narrowly escaped a messy death this afternoon after it became clear she had a boyfriend and was not a threat to her boyfriend.  

It’s believed Justine Gallery’s plans to assassinate Cassie came into play after Cassie was seen talking to Justine’s boyfriend for a little bit too long and laughing a little bit too much.

“He’s not that funny” Justine said sourly to herself.

“I swear, if you laugh one more time I’ll come over there and stab you” she said still speaking to herself.

Just as Justine was about to storm over and commit murder, Cassie’s boyfriend appeared and defused the situation playing out in Justine’s head.

The Advocate cautiously sat down with Justine, after she’d decided not to kill another woman for talking to her boyfriend, to see if this was a usual reaction or not.

“Ohh just ignore that, it’s the vodka talking” she said.  

“I love this girl, she’s so funny!”

Not one to fool easily, our reporter reached out to some other women in the town to see whether Justine’s reputation for being a bit of a psycho at times was accurate.

“Uhh, yes, I saw her once go and wedge herself in between her boyfriend and another girl he was innocently talking with – I think it was a colleague of his or something, it was so awkward” revealed a woman who wished to remain anonymous out of fear of retribution.

Man Trying To Impress Future Father-In-Law Swirls Wine Around Like He Knows What He’s Doing

TEXT:

A local 27-year-old who only recently stopped buying boxed wine has this evening executed what he thinks is a successful wine swirl while at dinner with his future father-in-law.

It’s believed that Will Mueller had been studying Netflix documentaries for two weeks prior to the dinner, all in an effort to impress the wine loving patriarch of his girlfriend’s family. 

“Mate, I’ve got no idea what I’m doing” Will told our reporter over the phone, shortly after the wine swirl in question.

“I think I did a good job, he was keeping a pretty close eye on me when I did it”

“Lucky I’d been watching that sommelier series on Netflix, otherwise I’d be completely fucked.”

As anyone knows, swirling wine at a restaurant is the quickest way to let everyone around you know that you went to private school and are pleased to see Scott Morrison be elected Prime Minister.

The Advocate reached out to Betoota’s top sommelier, who last year took out second place in the world sommelier’s competition, to better understand the nuances of wine swirling and whether it did anything other than make you look like a dickhead.

“Well, yes” he laughed pompously.

“Swirling wine introduces more oxygen to the wine, which in turn makes the wine give off its aromas and soften”

“Anyone who knows anything about wine knows to let it breathe first” he said looking down at our reporter over his nose.

Old Fashioned Uber Driver Whips Out the Chewy

TEXT:

A local rideshare driver has banked the 5-star rating barely 50 metres into a trip today. 

Alan Stevens, a retired accountant and local Betoota Grove resident who often gets bored enough to do a few trips around town for some ‘pocket money’ which he usually spends down at the Grove Hotel, did so when he offered his passengers a bit of gum. 

“Chewy?” said the friendly patriarch smiling and offering up the little Extra morsels to his half-cut patrons on the way into town for some event. 

“It’s as soft as a small-town council’s stance on dodgy developments.”

The group of mates who’d just had a couple of moderately cold beverages before heading off to an event you can actually attend after having a couple because our town doesn’t have anywhere near as many security guards who think they work for the special forces like Sydney or Brisbane does, gleefully accepted. 

“Just what I needed,” said one of the passengers who always means to buy a pack of chewy but never seems to get around to doing it. 

“Thanks mate, curiously soft this gum, just like your little pen pushing hands Timbo,” said the now audibly chirpy front seat passenger to one of his mates in the back. 

“You got Bluetooth,” he then asked the Uber driver in preparation to play something obnoxious tune that would make Stevens question whether even the surging fare made the experience worth it.  

After lying and telling his passengers he didn’t and flicking the radio to Nova or something, the conversation petered out between driver and drivees, and Stevens who’d done enough trips to realise you don’t have to have conversations with everyone you pick up enjoyed the rest of trip in relative peace. 

Stevens confirmed to our reporters a short time after the trip that he’s found a little piece of Extra Soft Chewy goes a long way in terms of his rating and rapport with often rowdy patrons.

“I used to do the bottles of water in all the doors thing, but I’ve given up on that and just fling them a bit of gum when they get in the car,” he said. 

“They often tell me they think it will help them get in, mask the fact they’ve had a couple and erase the garlic from the kebab they’ve often had the night before.”

Asian Mate Still Haunted By Severe Childhood Bowl-Cut

TEXT:

A charismatic local scaffolder from Betoota’s Flight Path District has today revealed why he refuses to get any hairstyle other than the blade 4 crewcut.

Kev Corrigan (33), one of two Asian mates in diverse social circle of deadshits from the light industrial outskirts of South Betoota, says he can never again bring himself to grow his hair out to the point of having a fringe.

“I’m never goin’ back” says Kev, as he recounts the thirteen long years of trauma he endured while having one of the most silky smooth bowl cuts in the Diamantina Shire.

Kev says from the moment he turned 13 and managed to wrangle a visit with his dad to the local Greek barber, he’s never looked back.

“My hair is beautiful” he says.

“That’s the problem”

“I could have the most stunning Steve Aoki mane…”

“But everyone knows you have to plough through the bowl cut if you want the pony tail. And I’m never going there again”

Eli Rolfe, the group’s other Asian mate, says he can relate – even though he went a different route in high school by growing the long peroxided side-fringes, during their brief departure from the friendship circle during the pool hall days.

Flash Of Orange Bank Card Fair Indication Someone’s Been Reading Self Help Literature

TEXT:

A local Yo-Pro in Betoota’s Old City District has unintentionally informed one of his colleagues that’s he’s been doing a bit of reading of late. 

Finn Hill (25) did by flashing his shiny new orange bank card at the cafe just moments ago. 

“Someone’s been reading some self-help books hey,” asked his colleague this morning, referencing the smash hit Barefoot Investor book, so popular with young professionals who have no self-control and feel powerless in a housing market geared against them. 

“Oh ah, this,” replied Hill, motioning to his brand spanking ING card, that his new disciple Barefoot, aka Scott Pape told him to get. 

“[Haha] Yeah that one was on the splurge account,” laughed Hill, who has been particularly struggling to curb his drinking and stockbroker’s snow habit of late. 

“Hoping to save a bit of coin actually,” explained the young solicitor living in the French Quarter who has been bringing in markedly terrible leftovers for lunch in recent times. 

Speaking to our reporters, Hill’s colleague explained that the appearance of the Orange card’s among friends and colleague’s has been particularly common in recent times. 

“That little orange card is a tell tale sign someone’s been reading a bit of self help shit,” he laughed. 

“I personally don’t need to bother as my parents have got a pretty handy trust set up, and dad’s already gone guarantor on a little investment for me down in Betoota Heights but good on Finn and the others for trying to do what they can.”

Upper-Middle-Class Woman’s Self-Diagnosed OCD About As Real As Her Self-Diagnosed Gluten Intolerance

TEXT:

A local woman has today used a serious medical condition as an excuse for her behaviour at a Betoota Grove Italian restaurant. 

Brittany Asiento (25) apologised to her friends saying it was her ‘OCD’ that was causing her to repeatedly rearrange her table setting so all the cutlery was perfectly aligned. 

One of Brittany’s friends, a qualified doctor, told the Advocate that Brittany always tries to claim she has OCD. 

“Whenever she does something orderly she says it’s because she has OCD”

“Obsessive Compulsive Disorder is a clinical mental disorder” 

“It’s incredibly insulting to people who actually suffer from it” 

“Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a mental disorder in which a person feels the need to perform certain routines repeatedly (called “compulsions”), or has certain thoughts repeatedly (called “obsessions”). The person is unable to control either the thoughts or activities for more than a short period of time.”

“A client of mine had to wash their hands every 30 seconds, rearranging cutlery every now and then is not the same thing.” 

Obsessive Compulsive Disorder is not the only medical condition Brittany claims to have. 

The Advocate can confirm that she has self-diagnosed herself with gluten intolerance as well. 

It’s believed Brittany sometimes claims to be gluten intolerant, seemingly when it suits her. 

Her friend continues to explain Brittany’s fake conditions. 

“Don’t get me started on her gluten intolerance, we’re at an Italian restaurant and I’ve seen her eating garlic bread and pasta” 

“The only condition she has is wanting to be special, which I think the majority of upper middle-class people suffer from”

Footyhead Bullishly Hitting Joint At House Party Moments Away From Being Spear-Tackled By THC

Betoota Dolphins centre, Todd Bellamy, is moments away from knowing what it means to green out, it’s been confirmed. 

Bellamy, who likes to think himself a bit of a tough guy, disregarded his friends warnings about smoking a whole joint to himself. 

Instead, challenging himself to smoke it as quickly as he can. 

“Oi, watch this” he naively said. 

After puffing on the jazz cigarette three times, Bellamy proudly announced he couldn’t feel a thing. 

“That’s barely touched the sides, boys” 

He proceeded to finish the joint by himself as his friends watched on laughing. 

What Todd didn’t know was that waiting just beyond his consciousness was a tsunami of TCH, just waiting to spear-tackle him and put him on his ass. 

Approximately 5 minutes after finishing the joint, the THC hit. 

Witnesses say Todd’s eyes glazed over and he began slurring his words and stumbling before falling sideways into a nearby stack of chairs. 

From there, while covered in chairs, he began uncontrollably vomiting, any attempt of self preservation disappearing with each retch. 

After laughing at the scene for 10 minutes Todd’s friends went to his aid, helping him up and putting him into a taxi. His current state is not yet known.

Inner-City Leftie Vows To Teach PM Lesson By Turning Safe Labor Seat Into Marginal Greens Seat

TEXT:

In the Inner city Betoota federal division of Mimimi, one local voter has today vowed to use his vote to teach Scott Morrison a lesson in the Federal Election next week.

How? By voting 1 Greens in both the lower and upper house.

Wyatt Enrytchus (32) says he’s never really thought much about the power he wields as a comfortable urban professional with a disposable income and 1.5 kids crammed into a heritage-defying rendered terrace house.

But after his favourite Prime Minister of all time was rolled in a messy lib spill last August, he’s been on a mission to oust the Nightwatchman that replaced him.

“We need to be focusing on tech and renewables” Says Wyatt.

“I come from a long line of Labor voters, but Turnbull had won me over from Shorten on that one”

“and now Morrison has effectively just run a 2007 Howard campaign”

“So, considering I am far too proud, and wealthy, to transition back to Labor…”

“I’m voting Greens!”

While local Greens Senator, Dr Rich Engay, was elected last time by stray votes from Wyatt’s particular demographic, who usually feel too guilty to vote green in both houses – 2019 looks like the year that inner-Betoota’s local Greens lower house candidate will finally leverage the support from this furious voter block of jaded enviro-bros and water birth mums.

However, what appears lost on voters like Wyatt, is that all he’s doing is undermining Labor’s safe hold on his local area – and making it harder for them to overthrown a Morrison Government.

“Labor are a bit too, you know… uniony” says Wyatt.

“A bit bogan”

“I know this seat has been Labor forever, but I don’t work in a fucken factory. I’m voting Greens”

Local Greens candidate Andy Vaxxer (22) says this is exactly the voter detachment he had been banking on.

“Just months ago I was a deregistered paramedic who was facing criminal charges for stealing and on-selling green whistles” he says.

“Now I’m basically locked in for a six figure salary for the next three years haha”

“Remember, a vote for me, is a vote for saying fuck you Scomo!”

Body Builder Skips Roid Cycle After Getting Enough Good Stuff From Poached Chicken Diet

A young gym enthusiast has decided to treat his body to a few months off the anabolics today. 

The 26-year-old aspiring bodybuilder and part-time personal trainer Brayden Wilson told The Advocate this afternoon that he’s decided to skip a cycle after realising he was getting enough of the good shit from all of the chicken he eats. 

“Yeah, I actually realised over the last few months that because of the sheer amount of chicken I eat, I’m effectively on a roids cycle already, by chicken proxy,” he laughed, referring to the sheer volume of growth hormones and shit they pump into battery hens. 

“So I thought, you know what, maybe I’ll give the double cycle a miss for the next few months, because I haven’t got a comp coming up for a little while,” said the young man who hasn’t yet had the personality sized hole in his life filled by his devotion to ‘fitness.’ 

“Might help with the deca dick too” he said crudely in reference to his erectile problems. 

“And hopefully the acne on my shoulders my die down a little as well.” 

Wilson said he hopes that the single-chicken-based cycle he’ll stay on for the next few months still gives him what he needs to throw down his weights at the end of his set – and grunt loudly for the duration of his work out.

Regional Cafe Wins Local Business Innovation Award After Adopting Non-Mug Sized Coffee Option

TEXT:

A cafe in our town’s Heights district last night walked away with a huge honour from the Betoota Chamber Of Commerce’s Annual Business Awards Night. 

The team at ‘Koffee‘ took home the coveted Business Innovation Award after adopting a cutting edge new industry practice this year. 

Like 97% of other cafes operating in regional towns and centres Koffee had previously only ever served coffee in a large mug, as is the custom outside of the city. 

However, demonstrating their eligibility for the Innovation Award, Bill Walters and his team decided a few months ago to start serving coffee in cappuccino cups, latte glasses, and even little espresso cups. 

Walters told The Advocate that initially many were sceptical about the transition to the 2019, and he copped a few sprays from some of the regular patrons who thought he was trying to rip them off and save on milk. 

“A lot of people in town don’t seem to be interested in the coffee, they just wanted giant ‘baby chinos’.”

“So they blew up that we were giving them ‘less milk.'” 

“But that decision has proven to have paid off today,” said the cafe owner making the most of the free Peronis on offer. 

“They said we were crazy, they said we were mad, but we’ve pulled it off,” said the successor to Lilly’s Laser Removal Therapy, the winner of the award in 2018. 

“Few of these ones on the house to celebrate,” said Walters motioning to his Peroni before necking it.

“They biting, mate?” asked a stranger passing Jerry ‘Grey Beard’ Brim. 

“Haven’t got a feed yet” Jerry replied. 

The Advocate sat down with Jerry to talk through his frustrations. 

“People see a fishing rod and can’t resist asking” 

“Half the time they’re not even interested in fishing, they just want to make conversation” 

“The first couple times are ok, but after 20 people asking it’s just annoying.” 

Wanting to press further into whether fishing rods hold some kind of neurological trigger, The Advocate reached out to the CSIRO. 

“We actually conducted a study into this 3 years ago” said Lewis Barton, one of the lead researchers at the CSIRO. 

“People are compelled to ask, it’s not an evolutionary thing but rather a social expectation” 

“Humans try to mimic other humans in a bid to create relationships, so it’s been a bit of a snowball effect from the first time someone asked a man holding a rod if they were biting” 

Our reporter had to remove himself from the interview because he too was about to ask Jerry if they were biting.

Hungover Woman’s Body Seeks Revenge By Waking Up On Weekday Time

TEXT:

A local woman’s body has taken revenge on her today after she poisoned it over a period of 12 hours last night. 

During the week, Tamara Johns (26), struggles to wake up with her 6am alarm, but it appears her mind had other plans for her as it clicked into gear and started processing over a hundred different non-existent scenarios that occurred during her night out last night.

The Advocate used a resident clairvoyant to speak with Tamara’s body to understand exactly why it was so vindictive towards its other self even though it would be within the firing line. 

“I don’t care if I’m affected by this. She wakes me up at 6am every day when all I want to do is sleep, so now it’s my turn “

“Screw her” 

According to Dr Christopher McPhone, a virginal yet a reputable biological researcher, it’s quite common for people like Tamara to be betrayed by their body when they least need it. 

“It just comes down to our circadian rhythm, which is a biological process that displays an endogenous, entrainable oscillation of about 24 hours. These 24-hour rhythms are driven by a circadian clock, and they have been widely observed in plants, animals, fungi, and cyanobacteria.” 

At the time of press Tamara was still in bed tossing and turning, doing her best to defy her wide-awake back stabbing body.

Mum Certain Newest Informercial Exercise Bike Is The One

TEXT:

Local mum of three, Ange Hodges, is feeling optimistic this morning as she puts away her wallet after purchasing yet another exercise bike advertised on the TV.

The bike in question is the newest model Danoz Direct, as well as having two wheels and a seat like the other 4 bikes she’s previously bought, this new bike has some cable things that you can pull back and forth, making the bike suitable for a whole body work out.

The familiarity of the scenario isn’t lost on Ange, who felt the need to justify her latest purchase to her judgemental family.

“This one is different” she said.

“I’m going to use this, just you wait” she added, almost trying to convince herself as much as her family.

“What’s wrong with the other 4 gathering dust on the veranda?” her husband questioned.

“They’re just no good” replied Ange.

According to sales from Danoz Direct, the majority of their sales actually come from mums who see the infomercial so many times that they become hypnotised and actually believe everything they hear.

“They’re our bread and butter” said the Danoz Direct marketing manager.

“We’ve been making the same bike for 10 years”

“You’d be surprised how many bikes people think they need.”

Mother In Law Sends Clear Message With Regifted Perfume And Misspelt Birthday Card

TEXT:

Tension has been mounting in the nearby suburb of Glencurry during what was intended to be a ‘low-key’ backyard get together. 

Melanie, 34, was celebrating her birthday with a small group of her closest girlfriends when mother in law Helen decided to pop by in what has been described as a “characteristically cavalier” manner, loudly announcing herself from the sliding door on the patio before making her way down to the birthday girl. 

“I heard she was having a bit of a do so I thought I’d drop off a little pressie!” she explained to Tracey, Stacey, Ann & Rach who were all just trying to make the most of the afternoon sun with a couple of mimosas. 

“I’m not sure if you’ve got this one, but the woman at the chemist said it’s quite good!” she explained as Melanie unwrapped a bottle of what appeared to be the exact same Elizabeth Arden perfume that she had given to Helen for Christmas. 

“Open the card! Open the card!” she instructed while brazenly snatching a sip of Stacey’s drink. 

“Dear Melany, Happy Days! Love Helen! That’s lovely…” said Melanie, who having been married to Helen’s son Lachlan for just over three years has not yet grown accustomed to this sort of behaviour and soon excused herself to go and wash up. 

She was last seen walking back up to the house from the backyard with Helen following closely behind.

Local Fuckwit Exposes Entire Town To Game Of Thrones Spoiler

TEXT:

A young man from the Betoota Heights district is facing criticism around town this morning for an extremely provocative action. 

With the Game Of Thrones hype at an all-time high, Bradley Simpson has risked life and limb today by driving around town revealing a huge spoiler to fans of the hit series. 

Revealing spoilers has long been regarded in the community as one of the most heinous crimes, and can attract severe punishment from the community and the judicial system. 

Barnaby Joyce knows first hand how risky the behaviour can be, after he was punched for revealing a Stranger Things spoiler in a Tamworth pub a little while back. 

However, much to the relief of many who were ready to go for the young man, the spoiler comes in the form of a hideous black automotive aerodynamic device on the back of his white Lancer. 

“Haha pretty good aye,” said Simpson, motioning to the car which is pride and joy. 

“Yeah I love the show, and though a sweet stencil would look awesome on the spoiler,” he said. 

“Haven’t actually had that much good feedback on it to be honest, but whatever, I reckon it looks sweet.” 

The young man then hopped back in his car and slowly meandered to the exit of The Advocate’s offices before sending it around the corner onto Daroo street and punching an orange light.

Freakishly Tall Mate Pops A Squat In Group Photo

TEXT:

Local longfella Pete ‘Pistol’ Sauer has today moved quickly to provide a more aesthetic average height to his group of mates.

During a long-awaited boys trip to Longreach, Pistol and the boys were snapped by a local venue photographer drinking the novelty Pimms that were on offer during happy hour at the iconic Bird Cage Hotel – but that wasn’t even the quirkiest element to the photo.

Aside from the little cardboard mugs of the gin-based fruit cups grasped firmly in their hands, the funniest part of the group shot is the fact that Pistol is crouched on the ground – kind of like a rap album.

While most of the Facebook commenters appear to be under the impression that Pistol was pulling a funny pose, like Rocco who was seen doing a wink and cheers while headlocking Chipper – only the fellow tall blokes really understand what Pistol was doing with his squat.

“I’m like two heads taller than these pindicks” says Pistol.

“Every time a camera comes out I have to hit the deck”

“It’s just part and parcel with being a fully formed man. I don’t want to embarrass them or fuck up the group shot… If I don’t squat, then the photographer usually has to take a few steps back”

Pistol says this is just one of the many responsibilities that come with not being a manlet.

“Dancefloors are the worst. I can never truly cut shapes without being the most visible man on the dance-floor… I’m more of a clap and twist while hunched over on the outskirts of the d-floor kinda guy”

Local Mum Returns From Soviet Training Camp With Concerning Interest In Affordable Childcare

TEXT:

A local working-single-mother-of-two has today confirmed the theories that she is a full blown communist by pledging her allegiance to whichever political party can’t offer her affordable childcare.

The prominent canteen mum from Betoota’s Flight Path District has long been accused of being a Red, especially after it was revealed that she was sitting on a waiting list for public housing.

“Yeah, I guess it would be nice” said Cheryl Smythers (37), a full-time hospitality worker, who still has snow on her boots.

“For me, it’s a big issue. I am struggle to bring home any income at all after having paid for childcare for my kids. The cost of living is quite high for a single mother like me”

This comes as Federal Education Minister Dan Tehan labelled Labor’s plan to ensure that childcare is available for low- and middle-income families ‘communist’.

The plan, which would prevent families like Cheryl’s from being priced out of care for their children, was attacked by the Minister because it would use taxpayer funds to provide the service.

Locals says that after her comments that show an alarming interest in affordable childcare, Cheryl’s regular trips to the industrial townships of North-Eastern Russia are stating to make a lot more sense.

“I knew there was something a bit off about her” said one local dad, Jobson Grothe (41), who has kids at the same school.

“First it was all that time she spent in those intensive Soviet training camps” he said.

“Then, at last week’s P&C meeting, she tells me that she knows how to wash and load an AK47 in muddy terrain while under fire from CIA-trained Afghanis rebels”

“Now the childcare thing… It’s a bit worrying”

“I’ve been suspecting she was a filthy communist for quite some time”

Happily Single Young Man Whose Only Set Of Sheets Haven’t Dried Going Bareback Tonight

TEXT:

A
local, very eligible bachelor has been forced to bite the bullet this evening
and admit defeat. 

After
trying to get on the front foot and chalk up an easy win by washing his sheets,
the man named Chris Anderson was hoping that the set had dried during the
course of the crisp Autumn day. 

However,
with the week only a day old, the young copywriter currently residing in our
town’s French Quarter was forced to take a fat L, as he arrived back home to be
greeted by sheets damper than Bill Shorten’s one-liners. 

“Fuck,”
he sighed acknowledging the fact that he was going bareback again tonight, for
the 2nd time this year. 

Like any bachelor living out of home, Anderson only owns one pair of sheets, so when he decides to wash them every few months because he’s spilt his dinner in there or pissed the bed the night before after a couple too many of Betoota’s finest (which he’s done twice now) he desperately needs the linen to dry before sundown. 

So on days like today, when that doesn’t happen, Anderson has to make himself comfortable with the fact that his going sheetless, or bareback as it’s otherwise known on his not-so-white-anymore Koala Mattress. 

“Ah
well, things could always be worse I suppose,” he said to us while he polished
off the last of a value range pizza. 

“I actually don’t think it’s that dirty to do, but it just sort of feels a bit dirty deep down. I’ll get another pair of sheets one day so this doesn’t happen.”  

For now, however, Anderson says it will be a sheetless night’s sleep.

Local Man’s Attempt To Flirt Goes Drastically Awry As Astrological Incompatibility Comes Up

A Betoota man’s attempt at establishing a romantic connection with his longtime crush has fallen flat this afternoon after it was revealed that the two of them are not actually astrologically compatible. 

Months after initiating contact with Stacey (23) over a good ten minutes worth of bar side banter regarding the Betoota Pub’s decision to keep using straws, Pete (32) has been slowly and innocuously laying down the groundwork for what he had hoped would become a lifelong partnership. 

Alas, all such hopes were dashed today after he playfully suggested that they google their zodiac compatibility. 

“15% Wow! I didn’t even know that was possible!” laughed Stacey, “Ahh well, I guess it’s lucky we’ve never hooked up!”.

Friend’s Older Brother Doesn’t Seem So Hot After Meeting Literally One Other Male

TEXT:

A local woman has come to an embarrassing realisation today after seeing her best friend’s ‘hot’ older brother in the real world and realising that she used to have a crush on a bloke she now wouldn’t touch with a ten foot pole. 

It didn’t really take that long for Annie Milson to realise her standards were too low, it’s believed all it took was for her to meet literally one other male. 

The Advocate sat down with Annie to talk through some of her embarrassment and find out just how serious her crush was.

“It gives me the horrors” said Annie, with a shiver that took over her whole body.

“He’d come to school to pick up Jas and I’d always go down and be really loud so he’d pay attention to me”

“Ah, fuck, and when I’d stay at her house I’d just hang around him like a bad smell”

“I would have looked so desperate.”

It’s believed that Annie’s situation is not unique to her, with basically any girl that went to an all-girls school also under the false assumption that friends’ older brothers are hot.

While most women manage to outgrow the phase without acting on their crush, some women make the unfortunate mistake of making out with their friends’ fugly older brothers, only to now be haunted by their naivety. 

Those who do fall into the latter category often manage to repress their mistake, however, it’s resurfaced by hilarious friends remind them at any chance they get.

Nearby One-Night-Stand Continue The Good Times By Open-Mouth Kissing In Breakfast Cafe

Disgusting scenes are unfolding at a French Quarter cafe this morning as a couple who are clearly still in their clothes from the night before are open mouth kissing each other across the table.

Witnesses at the scene say the couple reek of cigarettes and alcohol and are, for some reason, kissing extremely loudly.

“It’s like they’re holding a microphone next to their mouth. I can hear their saliva exchanging, it’s just a little bit much at 8:30 when I’m trying to have breakfast” said one customer. 

It’s believed that most of the customers are just trying to ignore the whole scat situation or take it for what it is and just let it happen.

“Haha, yeah it’s gross, but it’s also pissa (sic)” said one man.

“I remember when I used to do that, I’d never do it now because I’ve gained self-awareness, but back in the day? One hundred per cent”

While fully aware of how disgusting the couple are, the waitstaff have not taken any steps to stop the PG porn show.

“They’re still paying customers” said the cafe owner. 

At the time of press, the one-night standers were reportedly tearing apart their pancakes with their hands and messily shoving it into their mouths. 

It’s believed they still have a side of hashbrowns to come.

It’s believed he died mid-way through the hip-hip-hooray segment, but that has not yet been confirmed as the whole restaurant was swept up in singing.

Tim Lacoste (28) was a shy man in big crowds, with only his friends getting to see the true, Tim.

“I just thought it would be funny” wallowed the jingle instigator, who requested anonymity. 

“I didn’t know he was going to die”

“I should have listened, he begged me to stop, but that just egged me on further”

Witnesses at the scene are equally as distraught, some of them vowing to never return again.

“Every time I’d bite into some honey chicken I’d be reminded of what’s happened here tonight” commented one customer who looked like their love for honey chicken would win over their compassion.  

“I’ll never sing happy birthday again” said another.

A local ‘bitch’ on the other end of an email better be ready for a war of passive-aggressive words today after she sent an email beginning with the phrase ‘as per my previous email’.

According to reports, Audrey Frawley, the EA at a local finance firm, read the first line of the email and went into the zone.

Her mouth curled into a sinister smile, she sat up right in her chair and stretched her fingers.

“Hi Sally, which email are you referring to?” began Audrey, ready to out sass and out write her pathetic opponent.

“Perhaps I’ve missed something, I can’t see in your previous email where you answer my question” she continued to type.

“Could you please let me know exactly where you did? Again, sorry if I’ve missed it” she fake apologised like a seasoned veteran before pushing send triumphantly.

It’s believed Audrey then took a screen shot of the email thread and sent it to her work BFF, Stacey.

“Get a load of this! If she thinks she can ‘as per my previous email’ me, ha, think again sweetie” she wrote.

Bunch Of Bananas On Special Fail To Replenish Serotonin Levels After 4 Day Bender

Tragedy has struck a Betoota Grove home today after a young woman overdosed on Bananas. 

Stephanie Brink (27) was rushed to hospital by her flatmate at around 10:30am and is believed to be in a serious but stable condition.

The Advocate can confirm that Steph ingesting over 23 of the yellow fruit in an effort to increase the serotonin levels in her brain following a weekend of gluttony. 

Our reporter managed to sit down with Steph’s flatmate as she anxiously waited outside Steph’s room at the Betoota Base Hospital.

“It was so scary. She just started vomiting banana, it looked like a never ending banana smoothie,” said Steph’s flatmate, clearly still rattled from the morning’s events. 

“I’ll never eat another banana again”

According to countless research, while there is serotonin in bananas, it cannot cross the blood-brain barrier. 

In other words, it physically cannot get into the brain to supplement the serotonin Steph starved her brain of for 36hrs over the weekend. 

The nurse on duty revealed to our reporters that consuming the number of bananas that Steph did is enough to make anyone sick, and that she feels sick even thinking about eating that many.

“I can’t imagine how scat the poor girl was, thinking that eating 23 bananas was a good idea screams brain-dead to me”

“She’ll be absolutely fine, just put off bananas for the rest of her life.”

Long Haired White Guys Detest Unoriginality Of Any Music Made By Long Haired White Guys

A group of guys who look like they could be in Ocean Alley, or like a little brother version of Tame Impala, aren’t really into all that.

Local heart-throbs Joel, Jay, Ollie and Jordie (all 22) carry themselves like a bunch of young blokes that were raised in a sleepy beach town, but not the Bra Boy types, the Angus Stone types.

However, further inquiries find that they were actually all raised in deep suburbia and only started growing their hair out and surfing when they went to study at a shitty regional uni where it was cool to do so.

Even though these softly spoken creative dark-horses seem to adhere to every single stereotype related to their particular scene, including the band that they have just started, they also make quite an effort to distance themselves from it.

Their band, Domesticated Gazelle, is more a psy-folk rock sound that’s actually pretty unique to their scene – and is nothing like the stuff that comes out of Perth or Sydney’s inner-west.

As the group’s alpha, Ollie, who actually looks like he’d have a very weird shaped head if he didn’t have long hair, puts it.

“Most Australian music is pretty derivative off other Australian music”

“My old band, Sea Laneway, was doing a completely different thing too. We just make sure we don’t try and be like anyone else and just do our own thing”

Dad’s Eyes Light Up At Opportunity To Nail A Reverse Perpendicular Park

TEXT:

In some breaking news out of our town’s Old City District, a local father of 3 just got that look in his eye. 

The incident occurred just moments ago when Tony Gregson was in the middle of a run of the mill trip down to the shops.

Recently retired Gregson (69), was on the way down to pick up some supplies when he saw an empty perpendicular park on one of the main streets of town. 

With the meandering traffic backed up behind, Gregson’s eyes lit up at the opportunity to nail a reverse park in one go, as if anyone was watching, or cared. 

Throwing the head back Gregson, quickly snapped into gear and pulled off the manoeuvre he’s proudly been doing since he first had children.

“It makes it a lot easier when you’re pulling out,” explained Gregson seemingly ignoring the fact that you have to reverse in or out regardless of which one you do first. 

“I’d be lying if I said I don’t take pleasure in nailing the reverse perfectly,” said the dad biologically incapable of nosing into a park. 

Gregson then wandered off to make conversation with the cashier at the supermarket about some random topic as he purchased a couple of litres of milk. 

An anthropological expert at Royal Betoota University told The Advocate that they have found over an extended period of time that it’s impossible for dads not to reverse into perpendicular parks. 

“It’s really very similar to their inability to not contribute directional advice when Google Maps are already on the job, or speak at a normal volume on the phone anytime they are having a conversation with an old mate.”

After suggestions of beer pong from the more idiotic party members were rebuked, a few fun games of table tennis were played between friends who did not necessarily have the skills required to hit a ball with a paddle at an Olympic level.

“How about we put some money on it?” asked Greig as he pegged a topspin serve to the edge of the table.

“That’s one love.”

Insisting the table works on a ‘play the winner’ basis, Greig remained on the table for 20 consecutive minutes before everyone became bored. 

Friends of Greig eventually ran out of patience for their ultra-competitive friend, citing being unable to score a point against him and his Lleyton Hewitt impersonations as the main reason for wanting to do literally anything else.

Local Couple Clash Over What Constitutes A ‘Serving Size’

A local couple embarking on a joint weight loss journey have butted heads this evening while serving up an uninspiring, but diet approved, dessert.

The clash came after the man attempted to add three extra spoonful’s of natural yoghurt to his sad array of fruit.

“What do you think you’re doing?” snapped Miranda, the diet instigator.

Darren responded like a puppy that received its first scolding, unsure of what he’d done wrong.

“What? One isn’t enough…I’ll still be hungry” said an innocent Darren, frail and malnourished from the pittance of dinner he was allowed.

“The plan says we’re allowed one serve of yoghurt, not 3” continued Miranda.

“This is why you’re not losing any weight?”

“Yeah but it’s healthy” Darren retorted feebly, unsure if he even had the strength to fight on.

While Darren’s strength appeared to be fading rapidly due to a severe calorie deficit, The Advocate can confirm that he’s not malnourished at all. With witnesses saying they’ve seen Darren eating KFC 3-piece feeds alone in his car that he’d intentionally parked out of sight in back alleys.

It’s believed that Miranda had implemented the strict diet in an attempt to shred a few kilos off her partner before an upcoming wedding. By the looks of his shadow eating and misinformation about what constitutes a serving size, it seems unlikely that he will lose any weight at all.

Friends Eagerly Await End Of Breakup Cooling Off Period So They Can Begin Slagging Ex-Boyfriend

TEXT:

Time appears to have slowed down for a group of friends today after yet another day of uncertainty around their recently single friend has passed.

The friends are reportedly treading on eggshells around the woman, unsure of whether or not it’s safe to start slagging her ex.

The girl group is experiencing what’s commonly known as the Breakup Cooling Off Period (BCOP), the time after a breakup where couples may or may not get back together.

While it’s a draining time for the couples involved, it’s equally as draining for the friends around them – do they start telling their friend what a piece of shit Dave was, or will it come back to bite them in the bum?

The Advocate sat down with the girl group to get a better understanding of why they’re so frustrated about the BCOP.

“We’re living a lie, that’s why!” said Jasmine.

“Dave was such a dud and treated our Mandy like shit, but we can’t say anything because they might still get back together!”

“We’re like birds trapped in a cage, we want to fly free and say whatever we want but we can’t”

It’s believed Mandy and Dave have been in the cooling off period for about two months now, and according to Wikipedia, BCOP’s can go from anywhere as little as one month to as much as one year.

It remains unclear how much longer Jasmine and her friends will have endure this BCOP.

Herbal Tea Found To Be A Gateway To Crystals, Oils And Anti-Vaxxing

TEXT:

A disturbing report by the CSIRO has confirmed that herbal tea is a gateway into other alternative remedies such as crystals, essential oils and not vacinating your kids.

The long-term study followed the lives of average Australians and found a staggering 33% of herbal tea drinkers ended up abusing crystals and essential oils.

These numbers compare to 2% for coffee drinkers and 0% for mainstream beer drinkers, with the most at risk individuals being recently divorced women in coastal towns.

The controversial 14 year study has already been criticised by the alternative therapy community, including leader Gem Shala who stated “this type of negativity really grinds my chakras.”

“All scientific studies are bias because they are done by scientists,” stated Shala under the pink glow of a salt lamp.

“Where was the report done by free spirited people like me who aren’t scientist and don’t even believe in science in the first place? So out of alignment.”

In the report, one subject discusses how they made the move from supermarket herbal teas to visiting specialty tea shops, places regarded as the epicenter of crystal and essential oil conversion, with incense usually making an appearance somewhere in the middle.

“I purchased this tea because I liked the taste and then they told me about the healing qualities, I didn’t realise what was happening at first,” stated subject #14 Amethyst Marigold.*

“Before long I was pickling my own kimchi while facing North with a $400 jade egg in my pocket”

Marigold has since claimed she is now recoviering and has not had a drop of herbal tea in 18-months, let alone any exposure to essential oils or healing crystals and in a personal milestone, was able to visit a McDonalds without protesting. 

*Real name not used but, this is what people called her for a while.

Suburban Mayor Breaks The Mould By Not Being Directly Related To Any Residential Developers

TEXT:

In a refreshing change for the rate-payers in Betoota’s light industrial Flight Path District, newly elected mayor Keeley Uebergang (56) appears to only represent the interests of those who voted for her.

This comes after the Queensland Crime and Corruption Commission (CCC) decided to vet the local councillor, just in case they have to come back out here in three years for a full blown investigation – as is the case at the back end of any local government term.

“It’s weird, I know” says lead CCC investigator, Boe Fitzgerald.

“It appears that her family is made up of just normal residents who work in schools, hospitals and small business”

The Crime and Corruption Commission (CCC) is an independent Queensland Government entity created to combat and reduce the incidence of major crime and to continuously improve the integrity of, and to reduce the incidence of misconduct in, the Queensland public sector – particularly local councils.

With hundreds of old warehouses in the Flight Path District recently rezoned for residential use, locals say they were just waiting until a few dodgy DAs get approved for developers that are either part of Ms Uebergang’s immediate family, or her husband’s family.

Furthermore, close monitoring of the new mayor appears to show that not only does she not have any relatives in the residential development game, but she also appears to have no existing relationships with any of the undesirable Betoota Dolphins RLFC ex-players, most commonly implicated in any form of corruption in the local shire.

“I think she’s honestly just an accountant who wanted to give back to her community by taking a pay cut and working for the council” says the investigator.

“It doesn’t really add up. We might look into her assets. She might have ties to the new light rail contactors.” 

“But, then again, they are the same company that were hired last time we tried to build this form of infrastructure”

“The bloke at the counter took one look at my license plate and shook his head” she says.

“But, the way I look at it is, the E10 bowser exists for only one reason”

Man Wonders What He Did Wrong After Chinese Takeaway Arrives Without Bonus Prawn Crackers

Takeaway orderer Fergus Bromwich (34) is wondering what in the world he has done wrong after his Chinese food arrived without any bonus prawn crackers.

At approximately 6:30 pm, Bromwich decided to celebrate the weekend by having a few beers and eating dinner in front of the TV by himself, but with the notable exception of spending his disposable income on paying someone to prepare the food for him and deliver it to his door.

Feeling spontaneous, Bromwich picked up his phone and ordered the exact same set of meals he orders every time someone is mean to him at work and prepared for a sensational night of solitude. 

However, his anticipation for his pathetic night in was short lived as his bachelor’s banquet arrived without any bonus prawn crackers.

“I was going to eat half now and save the rest for tomorrow. Plans are ruined”

As Bromwich delighted the areas of his tongue that respond to MSG, he offered several possible explanations for why the staff at Betoota Gardens Chinese had denied him complimentary prawn crackers.

“Is it because I asked them where they were from? And when they told me Betoota Ponds I asked them where they were really from?”

Bromwich is yet to recieve a statement from Betoota Gardens Chinese regarding the missing chips, so for now it appears he’ll have to eat his culturally mishappen meal without the tasty joy of a miniscule deeo fried fitted sheet with an ingredients list no one knows with certainty.

TEXT:

Independent home brewer Phil Parkes (34) has failed to set the beer world on fire after his latest batch did not sufficiently fill the hole in his heart left by his ex-girlfriend.

Although Parkes is new to homebrewing, he claims to have brewed the finest pale ale he’s ever tasted or at least the best since he shared a home with the love of his life.

Pouring himself a schooner from a keg he will finish much quicker than he will readily admit to, Parkes states he found his groove as a home brewer after his schedule opened up to include more time spent wondering if he’d ever find love again.

“Mmm, how good,” mused Parkes.

“I mean, not as good as waking up to cuddles on a Sunday morning but very sessionable.”

Inviting friends around to sample his break-up brew, his crafty mates not only noted the hoppy profile but the distinct tones of solitude that will ensure they give him a call if they haven’t from him in a couple of days.

“This tastes like turning the group chat back to talk about beers,” stated long time friend Paul Woods.

“Upfront it has very strong fears of dying alone with an unfortunate after-taste of a drunken soirée on Tinder. Not bad on the malts.”

City Worker Gets On Front Foot Early With Weekend Chores And Stops In At The Schooner Shop

TEXT:

A local city worker named Angus Hunt has gotten his weekend off to a productive start this afternoon. 

The Betoota Heights local who works in the Old City District from 9-5 every Monday to Friday promised himself at the back end of last weekend that he would make the most of this weekend. 

“Yeah, I have plenty of life admin that’s piled up on my desk since Christmas, and I thought this weekend I would start to get on top of it,” Hunt said in the busy line at a popular Old City District establishment that has a decent happy hour. 

“And what better way to get on top of it than by getting a trip to the shops in nice and early,” he said.

“It’s only 5:30 on Friday and I’ve already made it to the shops, so I think that’s something to hang my hat on don’t you.” 

“Maybe the Schooner Shop isn’t exactly Aldi, but it’ll do for a few supplies,” he laughed loudly ignoring the fact his empty body will be sad and regretful again in roughly 48 hours, like it always is.

“Nah all jokes aside, I’m getting up early tomorrow and getting into it,” he lied.

‘One Owner, Always Garaged’ Listing Fails To Mention Decade Of Cutting Hoops In Costco Carpark

TEXT:

A local Betoota Heights resident may be a little guilty of fudging his online car listing this week. 

Brayden Smith, a 29-year-old engineer, who is looking to do the whole Aussie’s in London thing for a year or two, decided to post an ad for his car online in an effort to raise the funds for his overseas soirée. 

While there may be an element of truth in the statement that he’s kept his pride and joy in the garage of his parent’s house in Betoota Heights, and he has been the sole owner of the vehicle he purchased for nearly an average yearly wage on a high-interest loan in 2010, Brayden has confirmed that he might have neglected to mention what he’s used the ute for. 

The engineer who drives the ute to work everyday but doesn’t use it for tools because he is one of those site manager kind of engineers who doesn’t really do physical work, explained that he thought it was best he didn’t let a future owner know he’s lit up the Costco carpark more than a couple of times. 

“Yeah I didn’t put that in the listing,” he laughed this afternoon. 

“Obviously I’ve sent it a few times in the Costco carpark, but what the eye don’t see the heart don’t feel hey.” 

“And surely you expect that a piece of machinery like the VE’s been used to put on a bit of smoke show anyway.” 

“20 grand’s a great price regardless, any of your reporters interested? I’d do it for 19 if you paid 5 grand in cash.” 

The Advocate declined the kind offer.

Alpha Male Jumps Out At The Lights To Adjust Straps

TEXT:

A local chippy has today shown a blatant disregard for the law while asserting himself as the alpha of all motorists currently waiting for the lights in the Betoota Ponds junction.

32-year-old Tom Tripp says he wasn’t that sure if his most recent load of plasterboard was 100% tied down, while making a run back from Mitre 10.

Without a care in the world, Trippy jammed his luxury work vehicle into neutral and climbed out during the red, without so much as even throwing on the handbrake.

With the car ever so slightly idling back a few inches towards the nervous Nissan Cube driver station directly behind him in the lights, the ultimate tradie refuses to make eye contact with any of the other drivers.

With Triple M blaring from his stock radio speakers, fellow drivers say the nostalgic pub rock ballads of Australian Crawl almost served as a soundtrack to this brave feat of tied down adjustment.

A empty protein shake container sitting in the drink holder also suggests that the tradesmen also takes his health as seriously as his road safety.

While his use of gloves were brought in to question, Tom’s masculinity was able to remain in tact after it was revealed that he was only wearing them because of blisters he sustained while lifting heavy at a nearby 24-hour gym at 3:45am this morning.

Local Bushie Gets Two Hours Through ‘Roma’ Before Realising It Isn’t Set In Western Queensland

TEXT:

Retired Betoota cattleman, Ambrose Corones (73) has stopped just short of accusing Netflix of false advertising today, after watching 125 minutes of the 2019 film ‘Roma’ without seeing one reference to Artie Beetson.

Ambrose says this is the thing with the internet, you never know what you are going to get, and last night’s confusion would attest to this.

The stay-at-home-in-town grandfather of 35 rednuts says he’d been hearing great things about this new Oscar-award-winning motion picture, and considering his niece had finally taught him how to rig up the internet to the TV – he thought he might throw it on for a bit of Sunday night viewing.

What he eventually figured out was that Roma is a 2018 drama film written set in 1970 and 1971, Roma, which is a semi-autobiographical take on the directors upbringing in the Colonia Roma neighborhood of Mexico City, following the life of a live-in housekeeper of a middle-class family in the middle of great political uprising.

As Ambrose points out, the film’s actual storyline is a far cry from the Maranoa region of Western Queensland.

“I was expecting a film about rough necks getting into blues at the Queen’s Arms Hotel to be honest”

“Then I start seeing all these cops bashing student protestors and tear-gassing them”

“At that point, I thought it might’ve been a movie about all those cops Sir Joh trucked into the city from Western Queensland during the Commonwealth games”

However, as Ambrose’s wife eventually explained to him, the film was named after the Mexico City suburb of Colonia Roma – and the protests were actually based on the Central American nation’s civil uprising in the late 1960s and early 70s.

“Boy was my face red” said Ambrose.

“The thing I’m most concerned about is how I was able to watch 125 minutes of a foreign film without realising it wasn’t set in Roma, Queensland”

“My wife claims she knew what was going on, but I just thought they were speaking with those really fast Brisbane accents.” 

“I usually use subtitles when I’m watching the 7:30 report anyway”

New Supply Of Imperial Leather And One Ply In Bachelor Pad Bathroom Suggests Someone’s In Love

TEXT:

The freshly restocked toiletries in a local sharehouse bathroom has suggested that the safe, slovenly, space may soon be infiltrated by nice smelling perfume and shoes that make noise on the floorboards.

With a new bar of Imperial Leather soap, so new that it still has corners, and a fresh role of toilet paper that has obviously been purchased as an individual item from the Greek convenience store down the street – the housemates who didn’t spend any money for these luxuries are beginning to wonder what is happening. 

67 Daroo Street in the Flight Path District, more colloquially known as ‘The Kennel’ by its six slightly overweight male occupants, hasn’t seen one sleep over in the 7 months since the lease was signed.

While Brent (24, very junior finance worker) claims to have played a few away games over Summer, the rest of the house are united in their lack of interaction with the fairer sex.

That was until today, after someone replaced the basic human necessities in the bathroom without being asked to or demanding praise.

Considering only one of the housemates is what you would consider possibly not-straight, the remaining four really have no excuses outside of the video game addictions and their degenerate binge drinking.

The unsolvable riddle of ‘who spent $9.30 to drastically improve the living standards of six grown men’ continues right into the late afternoon – until Bryson was seen skipping down the internal staircase with fluffy looking hair that looks like it might have been washed with the new bar of soap.

Bryson is in love.

Ooooooooh.

Office Drone Who Just Started Keto Diet Almost Makes It To Lunch Without Bringing It Up

TEXT:

A local pen pusher at a firm in Betoota’s Old City District almost reached a significant milestone today. 

The young man named Ben Shillton nearly managed to make it through the slow Monday morning period without mentioning that fact that he has recently started the Keto diet.

However, the man who made a point of letting everyone know he did a bush walk on the weekend fell agonisingly short, bringing up his new meal regime just minutes before everyone meandered off to lunch. 

The ketogenic diet (or keto diet, for short) is a low-carb, high-fat diet that offers many health benefits, depending upon who you talk to, and is extremely popular with inner-city employees who are secure enough in their day to day life to be bothered with it. 

“Nah, I’m all good for lunch actually,” interjected Shillton into a conversation that broadly encompassed the rest of the office. 

“I’m still on the Keto,” he said, when a simple Yes/No answer to whether he was interested in joining the group Thai trip would have sufficed. 

The rest of the office then nodded and plodded off to the Thai restaurant down the road, failing to offer up any further prompts on the young mans diet, as he so desperately craved. 

At the time of press, Shillton was sitting at his desk picking at his pre-packed lunch while a vicious internal argument raged on about whether he could maybe duck off for something decent to eat.

University Lecturer Loses Train Of Thought After Finally Landing A Joke

TEXT:

A lecturer at the Betoota University in the town’s Old City District has been caught off guard today. 

This comes after the law lecturer was rattled by laughter from the crowd of students he was taking through some course material. 

Acker Demic (69) was left speechless this afternoon after realising that he had made the 30% of the course who actually attend his lectures giggle. 

He explained that he was in total shock when he realised that he had actually landed a joke, which caused the laughter. 

“Yeah, I was rattled, like some bunny politician in the hot seat in front of Leigh Sales,” he said. 

After a long and storied career as a university employee, Demic said that he had long ago stop expecting anyone to laugh at his appalling one-liners. 

“I’m used to the fact that only the mature aged student who wears a flat cap laughs at my jokes. The old English style flat caps, not the ones worn by people who like to break glasses on other people’s heads.” 

“So that’s why I forgot what I was saying to the students when they actually gave me some credit for a one-liner.” 

“It was just some dumb dad joke about the nature of  Tort Law changing more frequently than our country’s Prime Ministers.” 

“Ah well, I’m just glad some of them were listening I guess.”

Big Unit Wearing Fedora At The Pub More Than Willing To Provide Information About His Vape

TEXT:

A local pool shark at one of Betoota’s prominent late night dive bars is more than happy to discuss vapes with complete strangers at great length, it has been confirmed.

After encountering the usual “you got nicotine in that thing?” from some punter’s in the smoking area of the Lord Kidman Hotel in inner-Betoota, local IT specialist Glenn Glenmore (38) says yes quite sheepishly, and proceeds to explain where he gets it from. 

“You can’t buy it in Australia” he says, in a bad boy-ish tone that begs the strangers to ask where he gets it from.

“I get it from a mate, but you can get it online”

When asked how the fuck his mates makes nicotine e-liquid, Glenn refuses to give it away, implying his mate but be working on the long side of the law.

“He does the other stuff too” he says with a wink, suggesting that his ‘mate’ is the biggest drug dealer in the history of the Channel Country.

Out of sheer boredom, a bunch of nearby regulars continue the conversation, which leads to Glenn giving a shortball into his pitch on why vape’s are way more healthier than cigarettes but the government doesn’t realise.

The conservation veers into possibly one of the most boring discussions of the Australian government’s attitude towards vaping, before it peters out and Glenn puts his head phones back in to listen to a podcast that he also is more than willing to provide information about.

Worksite Traffic Controller Running A Bit Slow Today

Commuters heading to work in Betoota’s Old City district this morning reported seeing the world’s least motivated pair of eyes, attached to the face of the local traffic controller who it is fair to say, is running a bit slow today.

Enjoying the twin joys of starting the work week and being a pedestrian amongst road work, it was clear to all heading to their pointless jobs in the arts that the controller might be feeling a bit tender.

The lollipop lady has since been identified as Michaela Buckley (24) who struggled to express her disdain for living out two stereotypes at once as she vomited into her hard hat.

“We weren’t buzzing or nothing, just having some drinks and listening to The Cranberries,” murmured Buckely as she gripped to her lollipop as if it held the solution to purging one’s body of a bottle of Jameson.

“I didn’t mean to start acting the maggot. Feck me, it all went arseways.”

According to Buckley, her cold unmoving eyes and inability to full exhale have not impeded her ability to hold a stick with the sign on the end of it and get yelled at by truckies if she holds it for too long on one side.

“No, I feel grand like.”

Outback Murri Radio Station Endures Alarming Ratings Slump After 20 Minutes Without Any Troy

TEXT:

A remote Aboriginal radio station deep within the Diamantina Shire has called an emergency meeting with all executive staff members this morning, after losing 40% of their listenership between the 9am and 10 am news breaks.

This comes after DEADLY FM 98.5 shocked their loyal fan base with an unprecedented twenty minute break between Troy Cassar-Daley songs.

Troy Cassar-Daley, or ‘TCD’ as he is known in country music circles, or ‘Uncle Troy’ as he is known up north, or The Bundjalung Falcon as he is known back in South Sydney, has for many years been a staple rotation in the big rock and country radio stations around Australia. However his most prolific radio-play is in the bush on remote stations like DEADLY FM.

With 4 ARIA awards, 33 Golden Guitars and 9 Deadly awards, TCD is regarded as one of the most prolific singer-songwriters in Australian music. 

It is for this reason that DEADLY FM’s listenership are absolutely ropeable with the lapse in Troy ballads this morning. With thousands of complaints both on the textline and on social media. 

We spoke to one distraught DEADLY FM listener earlier.

“I’m not that angry… I’m just disappointed” said Aunty Annie, one disappointed member of the BUSH JURY, a group of VIP listeners who are responsible for the selections of the Friday arvo count down.

“They know how it works” she says.

“We get Dolly Parton at Midday. Goanna at knock-off. Kev Carmody at the top of every hour and pretty much rotate between Slim and Troy for the rest of the day”

Troy Cassar-Daley was approached for comment but his management declined on his behalf, after stating that he was too busy in the studio, where he is working on a new album dedicated entirely to the 2014 Rabbitohs premiership.

Local Woman Wishing Boyfriend Would Look At Her Like He Does At Cafe Menu With Hash Browns On It

Sitting at a trendy French quarter cafe, Leslie Antwerp has found herself questioning her boyfriend’s love and desire for her after catching him staring longingly at one particular part of the menu. 

It’s been confirmed that Timbo, her boyfriend, had been locking eyes with the sides on the menu, specifically what’s best described as a perfectly golden combination of crispy and fluffy potato – otherwise known as the hash brown. 

Leslie watched Timbo fantasise with the menu for 5 whole minutes before she spoke up; conflicting reports suggest that Timbo may have even had drool dripping from his mouth. 

“Timbo, what the fuck?” 

“Are you messaging another girl behind that menu?” she laughed.

Snapped out of his trance, Timbo laughed at his girlfriend. 

“What, babe? Sorry, it’s just that they’ve got hash browns on the menu”

“I don’t care what the menu has on it” snapped back Leslie.

“I wish you’d look at me like that?” 

Timbo almost laughed at this but managed to suppress his response.

Local Serial Killer Certain He’s Handsome Enough To Be Worthy Of A Podcast

TEXT:

Known for terrorising a suburban neighbourhood over a six-year period and looking dapper while doing it, local serial killer Norman Tyler (35) is certain he’s handsome enough to be worthy of a podcast.

According to Tyler, his MO isn’t the most interesting to the desensitised masses of true crime podcast listeners and unfortunately for him, his childhood was tragically uninteresting.

“One time I remember my father, he was a cruel man, took a chip from my Happy Meal without asking,” stated Tyler, hoping his back story would make for a gripping podcast.

“Luckily I’m very charming and good at persuading people..”

Tyler proceeded to vividly recount the incident where he bludgeoned his father to death, taking extra care to mention how the blood splattered into his fringe creating a rough-one-in-the-boyband type look.

Posing in his cell, Tyler stated that he believed a podcast would finally get made when he could come up with a serial killer name that promoted both his sick behaviour and sickening style.

“I put a tender out to see if any PR agencies would like to represent me. Turns out PR agencies are careful about who they align with so I’ve only got 908 replies.”

Ageing Rock God Impressed By Crowd’s Harmonised Groan After He Starts Playing Some New Stuff

TEXT:

An iconic rock god from the late 80s has tonight found himself admiring his thousand-strong crowd after they were able to hit a pitch-perfect low C note, all in complete unison without any rehearsal. 

The miracle happened following the artist announcing that he was going to play a few tracks off his new album.

“Alright, Betoota! Who’s having a good time?”

“These next few tracks are from a new album I’ve been working on, I hope you like them”

At this point the crowd emitted the sound, which can best be described as a long groan.

“Uggggghhhhhh”  a thousand people harmonised.

It’s believed that the musician went on to play at least 5 songs from his new album, effectively taking up all of the remaining time on his set list, the time allocated for his more popular and anticipated tracks.

The Advocate sat down with the rock god after the show to see how he thought the show went.

“Who knew this town was so talented?”

“Did you hear that out there? That was a pitch perfect low C”

“Unbelievable”

It’s not clear how the rock god thought the groan was positive, perhaps the two-decade long rock & roll lifestyle is having more of an effect on his brain capacity than originally thought.

Man With Dinner Plans Responsibly Moves From Pints To Schooeys After 6th Beer In 2-Hour Window

TEXT:

Local man, Jim Sampson, has impressed his friends this evening after publicly declaring that he has dinner and isn’t going to drink any more pints, instead opting to only drink schooners for the next few rounds.

The announcement was followed by a chorus of praise from Jim’s friends, commending him for being so mature and responsible.

“Mate, Jess is lucky to have you”

“Nah, good on you though”

Although Jim did want to stay at the pub with his friends, he silenced the voice in his head, ignored his friend and dragged himself to dinner with Jess – making it only 20 minutes late to their original reservation.

Reports from the scene say that Jim might have been better off staying at the pub, as he wasn’t in a great state at the dinner.

It’s not yet known whether Jess has forgiven him, however, friends of Jim later told The Advocate that he was well and truly in trouble after his slip-up and as a result has given up drinking for Lent.

Junior Stockbroker Enters Next Phase Of Career After Being Invited To Long Lunch By Boss

Junior stockbroker, Nathan Abbott-Smith’s pig-like behaviour has paid off today after his boss extended him an invitation to a partner-only long lunch. 

The invitation has caused quite a stir amongst his junior colleagues as they’re all aware of what the invitation actually means – Nathan’s made it.

The Advocate sat down with Nathan before he was due to depart for the lunch, which has since been revealed to be at a hatted restaurant called La Pepe’s, in the French Quarter.

“The last 7 juniors that’ve been invited to this lunch have started managing their own portfolios in 3 months” he said to us. 

“So, I’m feeling pretty good about this”

According to records at the finance firm, Barnest & Bond, you won’t even be considered for a promotion unless you’ve sat through a session with the four big dogs that run the company.

The Advocate reached out to some of Nathan’s junior colleagues to see how they’re feeling about Nathan’s fast-tracked career.

“It’s kind of a stich up” said one hard-working woman, who actually has far better results than Nathan.

“Nah, good on ‘im!” added a fellow male who’ll probably get invited to the next lunch.

Reports from La Pepe’s indicate that the lunch is going quite well for young Nathan, he’s made the partners laugh and there have been multiple bouts of back-slapping. 

It’s believed Nathan’s boss is going to pull him aside shortly and let him know he’s one of the big boys now.

Charity Auctioneer Patiently Waits Until Crowd’s A Couple  Deep Before Kicking Things Off

The Betoota Bulls Charity Ball has been a landmark on the town’s social calendar for quite some time. 

Reports from the scene say champagne and beers have been flowing non-stop since it kicked off today.

According to the Ball’s program, an auction was due to take place at moments ago, however, the auctioneer remains crouching in the corner, evilly tapping his fingers together and biding time.

The Advocate quietly approached the auctioneer to see why he was deliberately delaying the schedule and why he was sporting such a sly smile.

“Ah, you found me” said Michael Fowler, the auctioneer.

“I, ah, am waiting for…”

“Nah, I can’t lie. No one will bid unless they’re half cut”

“I’ve got a kid’s BBQ set here, no sober person would pay for that”

“So, I just like to wait till they’re at least 4 standard drinks in before I get on the mic.”

Reports from Ball indicate that Michael’s plan worked perfectly, with every single one of the auction items selling for well above their recommended retail price. In particular, a signed Sydney Swans jersey that sold for $1300.00. 

The jersey wasn’t even the most overpriced item, a young man from West Betoota bought his girlfriend a serviette with Lee Kernigan’s signature on it for $2000 – it’s not yet known if this serviette has any ongoing monetary value, or if the girlfriend even knows who Lee Kernigan is.

Inner-City Leftie Hopes Tragic Redevelopment Of Nearby Public Housing Has A Good Cafe At Least

Local inner-city leftie Gen Eckse (49) says the dispossession and forced removal of generations of low-income and vulnerable inner-city residents is such a shame, but it’ll be interesting to see what the developers have planned.

While drinking out of a designer Keep Cup on the steps of her recently renovated terrace house in Betoota’s once rough French Quarter, Gen looks on at the demolition workers pulling apart the iconic ‘Russel Hinze Tower’ and sighs.

“I can’t believe they were allowed to do that” she said, solemnly staring at the once-bustling public housing projects that she used to make weekly noise complaints about.

The fact that Gen was consulted by council several times and even attended a few community meetings about it appears lost on the part-time graphic designer, as she laments the edginess that she once bragged about at dinner parties, until the kids got old enough to ask about why the old drunks outside the convenience store didn’t have a home to go to.

“It’s like it happened overnight”

“It’s such a shame”

As the alarm on her iPhone buzzes to notify her of her upcoming pump class at the recently opened 24-hour-gym next door, Gen takes one last sip of her coffee.

Local Bull Rider Effortlessly Pairs His Cowboy Wardrobe With DC Skate Shoes

TEXT:

While local bull rider, Peter Seeney (29), never had the honour flying out the chute at the Easter Show or the Ekka – he’s still a household name in the Diamantina Shire.

After years on the road with different rodeo circuits, the former juvenile offender turned jackaroo turned reckless showman is slowly climbing the ranks.

With whispers of a paid trip to Brazil or even Texas coming up, it seems Peter may soon be fully exposed to the trans-national culture of competitive bull riding that he has been trying to emulate since his teens.

But until then, he’s forging his own look – one that is more representative of his regional Australian lifestyle

With a fashion sense that has elements of the traditional Outback country and western style, a bit of small town motocross – and a heavy influence of West Coast American gangsta rap – Peter is one of maybe a thousand Australian townies who sit quietly at the end of the bar waiting to be asked if they had a chance to ride Chainsaw.

With his achievements inside the arena on show for all with his giant belt buckle, a black Akubra and paisley shirt – Peter is the last true cowboy. That is, right until you follow his baggy Levi jeans down the chunky DC skate shoes.

It’s a look that is seen at gymkhanas and country race meets right around the country, and one that the older rodeo identities have grown used to – as they realise the kids can’t really afford a nice pair of moleskins and baxters – not when you take into account how much a can of JD and cola nowadays.

With a skinny frame and a filterless rollie permanently fixed to his hand, Peter says you should wait til you meet Howie, who’s currently in the shitter. Because he’s ridden Chainsaw before.

Lebanese Barber Swears To God Mate You Shoulda Seen The Bloke We Just Had In Here

Prominent Betoota hairdresser and male grooming expert, Elie Corrie (57) says you wouldn’t believe the rare unit they had in the shop this afternoon.

An already pretty loud conversation with one of the customers waiting to go up next has moved forward in leaps and bounds in terms of energy.

The yarn, which was initially about how many more young birds you see getting around with tattoos nowadays, quickly turned into a conversation about how you rarely see any young blokes who don’t have tattoos, and how some of them are just taking the piss.

“Swear to God mate. Up to his eyeballs” says Elie, with passionate use of his free hand while halfway through a straight razor on a seemingly unconcerned regular.

“Mate he must have been off his head. Had to have been”

“Two full blown sleeves, fingers and all mate…. Legs, same thing. Both legs all tattoos”

The customer sitting next to you in the waiting chairs can’t believe what he’s hearing.

“No way” he says, said as more of an exclamation as opposed to actually questioning Elie’s yarn.

Elie responds instantly, as though it was questioning his yarn.

“Wallah. I am not kidding!” he spits, before bringing his daughter into it.

“Tell them. Tell the man Jessie. Two full sleeves”

His daughter, Jessie looks up from the broom and clarifies the story.

“It’s true. Fingers and everything and his legs” she says.

Both men start laughing while Elie runs his fingers down his arms to show where this alleged criminal/drug user had tattoos.

“And guess what mate. And guess what” he says.

“What?” asks the excited customer.

“Head… and neck. As well.” says Elie.

“Swear to Go-uhd”

“I could not believe it”

The customer who must know Elie quite well – given their non-stop referencing of mutual friends – stands up halfway through his fit laughter and makes his way to the now empty chair.

He appears to have bypassed you in the line and there really is nothing you can do about it.

Apprentice Whose Phone Has Been Cut-Off For Unpaid Bills Puts 20 Inch Rims On His Work Van

Apprentice chippy Luke Swainy (19) has today provided the older blokes on site with a rare glimpse into how his cannabis-hazed brain works.

Swanny, as he likes to refer to himself, has rocked up to work today with a $2000 set of KM702 Deuce Satin Black Milled 20 inch rims, on his $6000 dollar Toyota Hiace.

It’s a new look that he’s excited to debut, as he informs the world that this work van is also a weekend van.

This new impulse purchases appears odd, considering the fact that Luke has eaten packet mi goreng for every single meal since he was signed on as a first-year 9 months ago, and regularly complaining about the fact that his phone has been barred from service because he can’t pay the consistently overwhelming bills that he racks up from indiscriminately playing Candy Crush at any spare moment, with or without access to wifi.

“I’m gonna lower it too” says Swanny, while flicking wrist and making a clicking sound with his middle and index finger, as young males that age tend to do.

“Drop her right on her guts. Maybe gets some airbags or hydraulics [teenage laugh]”

Swanny’s honest belief that he will be able to afford any of those new features without a high-interest loan from a financial institution in no way associated with his current bank warms the hearts of the older blokes on sight, who begin to reminisce on a time when they too thought doing up a work vehicle was a good idea.

“Might get like a TV or something in there for when I get some action”

At time of press, Swanny was seen playing inappropriately sensual R’n’B slow jams as loud as his Kenwood 2 way speakers could manage.

After a big day hanging cooler room doors and jump starting fans, the five-years-and-running bachelor has cracked himself open a frosty tin of the bravo bravo.

With mum and dad not home for another couple hours, Sammo takes to social media to let his 347 followers know that this is what it’s all about with a selfie video of him drinking some piss!

The video, which appears to have been taken just after he cracked the can open, shows the local touch football identity taking a big swig of the first of two beers he will be drinking today. The video ends with Sammo tapping the camera lens in a blokey kind of cheers.

While his video isn’t as tragic as previous videos he’s posted, some of which have shown him doing the same thing while drinking alone at a pub, it’s still pretty heartbreaking.

“Why don’t you go over there and have a beer with him” says his best mates mum, Jenny, after seeing the video on instagram.

Sammo’s best mate, however, says he’d love to but it’s fucken Tuesday and he’s got gym in like an hour.

At time of press, Sammo was posting Instagram stories of funny shit that was happening on A Current Affair, with his old man yelling at him to come have some dinner in the background.

‘Where Did The Weekend Go’ Asks Woman Who Was Cooking Pasta At 3 AM On Saturday Night

TEXT:

A young local woman from Betoota’s French Quarter is doing a bit of soul searching at her desk this morning. 

The woman named Cynthia Williams, who was cooking a pot of pasta 18 or so hours ago, says she’s feeling pretty empty today. 

Without an endorphin in her body, Williams told The Advocate early this morning that her weekends always seem to vanish in a flash. 

“I just don’t know where this weekend went,” sighed the Accounts Manager who was cooking an entire saucepan full of pasta to consume with half a litre of tomato sauce and some grated cheese at 3am on Saturday night. 

“I always seemed to get back to my desk on a Monday morning even more burnt out than I was when I left on Friday,” said the woman who kicked things off with a few joint trips to a toilet cubicle at a popular city worker’s bar on Friday evening. 

“Friday rolled into Saturday and I spent Sunday moping around licking my wounds, and got the generic bout of anxiousness when the light started to fade in the evening, as another weekend drew to a close.”

“One day I’ll get my shit together, go straight home after work on Friday, get a good nights sleep and then go for a day trip out to Lake Betoota, or go for a walk up the range,” the young woman lied.

Photos Of Local Bachelor’s New Tinnie Almost Rivalling Baby Spam In Social Media Feed

TEXT:

Wayne Lindfield, a local FIFO worker, who is also single, treated himself last payday by purchasing a second hand tinny to facilitate his growing obsession with fishing. 

While his friends were initially happy for the man to have something that keeps him occupied, the barrage of photos swamping their Instagram feeds is fast turning that happiness into annoyance.

Since purchasing the boat 14 days ago, Wayne has uploaded over 27 minutes’ worth of stories, 5 separate Instagram posts and 2 albums on Facebook. 

In Wayne’s defence, the photos aren’t entirely of the small vessel, there are also a number of photos of his new fishing gear and the small fish that he has caught so far.  

Regardless, the oversharing has his friends comparing his spam to that of new mothers – a group whose online reputation is painful at best.

“You’re worse than Stacey and her new-born, mate!” heckled one friend.

“I’ll have to mute you if you’re not careful”  

“You should just go and join the mothers’ group, you can share tips on how to piss off your followers with your spam”

Despite the clear disapproval from his friends, Wayne has no plans on slowing his boat uploads.

“Yeah, no way! This boat is the smartest investment I’ve ever made – and I was in crypto before it shit itself!”

“If they’ve got a problem with my uploads they can just unfollow me, fuck ‘em”

Teenage Goths Revealed To Be Best Authority On Whether Global Warming Is Real

TEXT:

A new report published by Australia’s peak weather, climate and water agency, the Bureau of Meteorology, has today revealed an unlikely new indicator of global warming. 

Chief Meteorologist Dane Virga announced to the media that they have been monitoring the activity of young goths and based off that, they’ve been able to conclusively prove that Global Warming is real. 

“Over the past 20 years we’ve noticed a steep decline in the number of goths walking the streets” 

“Initially we thought this was because being a goth was not in vogue, but we soon discovered that the goth community had just gone underground to escape the rise in temperatures” 

“We then started monitoring their behaviour and we found that on cooler days they’d venture outside, but on the warmer days they were nowhere to be seen.” 

“It’s quite simple really, goths hate the warm weather and the globe is warming, we can’t believe other countries haven’t notice this yet – especially Germany.” 

While goths may be a little hard to take seriously, one notorious climate change denier is taking the report rather seriously. 

Tony Abbott has come out and publicly praised the report going as far as to say that if someone had shown him conclusive research like this earlier, he would have had a vastly different position on climate policy while he was PM. 

Perhaps the current PM should have a look at the research ahead of the election and rethink his position too.

Country Dad Reckons His Home Cooked Breakfast Would Cost $40 Down In Sydney

TEXT:

A Betoota Cotton Farmer has caused his family to roll their eyes in unison this morning after proudly looking at his breakfast and stating that his creation ‘would cost you bloody $40 down in Sydney.’

The breakfast in question is what Jim Macksville likes to call A Big Royale; bacon, poached eggs, roasted tomatoes, hash browns, avocado, fetta and a sprinkling of dukkah.

The Advocate sat down with Mr Macksville and his family of 4 to see why their reaction to their father’s culinary skills was so negative.

“Because he says this about every meal he or mum makes” said Josephine, Jim’s oldest daughter.

“We get it, Sydney is expensive, but we’re just sick of hearing about it,” added Tom, the middle child.

“I don’t know why you’re sick of hearing it, I’m just trying to educate you kids,” Mr Macksville said. 

“Maybe teach you to make breakfast at home instead of going out and wasting 0.004% of your future home deposit,” he continued.

This comment caused the whole family to roll their eyes again.

“Dad, everything is more expensive in Sydney, just accept it,” said one of his kids.

“For the sanity of everyone in the family, can you just please try not to comment on every meal? We’re sick of it.”

It was clear that this request put Mr Macksville in a very awkward position. He wanted to do right by his family, but it was in his fatherly DNA to comment on the comparable cost of a meal.

With lunch not far away, Mr Macksville’s ultimate test is fast approaching.

Man Wearing Fox Racing Flat Cap Lies And Says He’s Never Glassed Someone

TEXT:

An outer Betoota Quarry man, Chayden Bell, has today lied through his teeth today while telling his new girlfriend’s father that he had never been in a bar fight. 

The lie in question came about after Krystal’s dad, Kyle, started grilling Chayden at the family’s dinner table in a bid to find out whether this Chayden was good enough for his princess, Krystal.

“So, you reckon you’ve never been in a bar fight?” questioned Kyle, not believing Chayden for a second.

“Nah, Mr Krystal’s Dad, never. I’ve never glassed anyone either.”

While usually you would give your daughter’s boyfriend the benefit of the doubt, in this instance Chayden had what’s known in the poker circuit as a ‘tell’.

Chayden was wearing a Fox Racing cap. Not only that, but he had bent the brim of it so forcefully that it nearly formed a full circle.

Speaking to The Adovcate after the interaction, Kyle explains how he knew the bloke was sus from the minute he got out of his white ’03 Holden Commodore V8.

“You don’t wear a Fox cap if you’re a straight shooter”

And he’s right. According to a report carried out by the QLD Alcohol Fuelled Violence Commission (AFVC), 76% of glassing’s in pubs are carried out by men wearing Fox Racing caps.

It’s not yet known whether Kyle has put an end to the relationship or has continued to let his daughter go out with the public nuisance.

95% Of Population Has A Slight Scoliosis In Need Of 16 More Appointments, Says Chiropractor

TEXT:

A local Chiropractor has confirmed today that unfortunately almost everyone is suffering from scoliosis. 

Scoliosis is a sideways curvature of the spine, and in most cases the cause is unknown. 

The practitioner, who is notably not a doctor, and isn’t really in fact a trained medical professional at all, explained to The Advocate this morning that it’s scary how many people actually have scoliosis. 

While actual doctors prescribe certain types of treatment to help with the condition, local chiropractor in the French Quarter, Shon Key, insists the best treatment is coming in and seeing her. 

Shon explained that rather than surgery or physiotherapy, the only way scoliosis can be effectively dealt with for the ‘95% of people who actually live with the condition,’ is by stopping in for 15 plus visits at her ‘practice’.

“I wish it wasn’t the case, but unfortunately, the only way to deal with issues like scoliosis and many others is to be seen to by a chiropractor,” Key said. 

“For scoliosis, I usually help resolve problems associated with the condition by vaguely massaging snake oil into the clients back for 30ish minutes.”

“Do not, under any circumstances, listen to your GP or your Physiotherapist on stuff like this.” 

“Just come in and see me for a few sessions if you are serious about your health.” 

Key then explained that the chiropractor down in Melbourne under fire this week for his treatment of a two week old baby is being unfairly targeted. 

“That’s a classic example of the mainstream media and the government trying to run scare campaigns against alternative medical professionals.”

Local Tradie’s Mate Obviously Behind Hideous New Logo

Luke Rathbone has confirmed this afternoon that he is ready to take his business to the next level. 

The 29-year-old pest-controller from Betoota Heights did so after revealing his new uniform and new logo to The Advocate this afternoon. 

“Not bad aye,” Rathbone said to our reporters down at the Dogs Leg pub in the Heights a few moments ago. 

“Really let’s my clients know I’m not some fucking cowboy.”

The Betoota Dolphins Reserve Grade winger explained that a lot of work time went into the new log and polos, and he’s glad they’ve come out looking top notch. 

“I mean, I really wanted to make sure that they looked the part,” Rathbone said. 

“Which is why I didn’t just go with some generic navy tee’s. That just makes you look like a bottom rung plumber or concreter. The polos demonstrate you know what you’re doing.” 

Rathbone then explained that his mate who’s ‘done a bit of graphic design and stuff before’ was in fact behind the brand new logo. 

“Yeah he’s done a cracker of a job on it. The colours work really well and I reckon he’s nailed it.” 

“Apparently it took him a fair while to do, but was heaps cheaper than if I went to some wanky agency in the French Quarter, so all’s well that ends well.”

Boyfriend Uses Up All His Valentines Brownie Points By Going On 48 Hour Bender With Flat Phone

A local Betoota Ponds man who remembered Valentines Day for the first time in his 4-year relationship has burnt through all of his newly earned brownie points over the weekend.

Michael Hawkins (29) was feeling pretty chuffed with himself for remembering the big day, and thought he might treat himself to a schooner or two over the weekend.

That was 72 hours ago. 

And Michael’s girlfriend, Tash, is still absolutely fuming this morning.

“I’m was in the good books so hard,” a shadow of Micahel said to our reporters at his desk this morning. 

“I think I might be out of them now.” 

The Advocate then contacted Tash to confirm, and that was, in fact, the case. 

“I don’t care that we went for a nice dinner and that he got me flowers, he was out for 48 hours, and 24 of those were with a flat phone,” she said.

“I kept trying to call but his phone goes straight to voicemail.”

Bloke In Bunnings Ad Not Instilling A Lot Of Confidence In DIY Customer

TEXT:

Sitting back watching TV from his half-renovated living room, Jez Walker wonders if the teenage rock enthusiast in a Bunnings uniform talking about eaves and guttering really has much of an idea about home improvement at all.

The rock enthusiast, or Decklan as his name tag suggests, is one of the many Bunnings employees who star in the home improvement giant’s commercials. 

In this particular ad, Decklan is telling DIYers that he can personally solve any question or query about home improvement, and if you find a cheaper price on a stocked item, he’ll beat it by ten per cent. 

“I’d like to see the last house you renovated, mate” Jez said to the TV.

“As if you can give me good advice on my reno”

“I bet you don’t even have calluses on your little hands, Decklan!”

In another commercial break, Jez saw another Bunnings ad but this time with another employee – one who he thought looked equally as incompetent.

“I don’t trust you either!”

It’s believed that this is a pretty common train of thought amongst Australians looking to carry out a DIY renovation on their property, with 79% of Aussies saying they wouldn’t trust the advice of Bunnings employees.

Despite the trust being so low, The Advocate can confirm that Jez is going to go into Bunnings to pick up supplies tomorrow morning.

Bloke Who Crashed On The Couch After House Party Better Fucking Grab A Garbage Bag

TEXT:

Last night Brittany Minkville and her housemates hosted a party for over 150 people at their 3-bedroom terrace in the French Quarter. 

The bottles, vomit and other debris make it look more like 3000 this morning.

Reports from the scene indicate that Brit and her housemates are about to commence the clean-up process but can’t until their mate, Carl, gets up off the couch.

Brit, who’s an aggressive Gemini, told our reporters this morning that if Carl wants to pass out on her couch, he can get up and bloody clean.

Not employing a skerrick of consideration, Brit has allegedly started noisily picking up bottles and dropping them into the bin right next to Carl.

However, despite her best efforts at waking him up, it’s understood that he still isn’t budging.

In a further attempt, she then put on some ‘cleaning music’.

“Carl, are you for real?” she finally said.

It’s believed that Brit the gave up on the passive-aggressive approach and jumped straight into full on aggressive waking up techniques.

“Oi!” She yelled into his face.

“Carl! Wake up!”

“Don’t think you can sleep through this clean-up” 

He then stirred, at which point Brit decided to shake him.

“You always do this! Get up and help us clean!”

It’s believed that Carl did end up helping Brit and her housemates with the clean-up, but only for five minutes. 

He said he would clean up the front of the house, but actually ordered an Uber and left. 

It’s yet to be confirmed whether Brit and her house mates have realised.

Latest Water Bill Suggests Mum Must Be Growing Cotton Out The Back

TEXT:

While the majority of NSW is in a crippling drought, a local mother of two must have completely missed the memo. 

June Daily, more so her husband Rodney, got a rude shock this afternoon upon opening their latest bill from Betoota Waterways.

“Jesus Christ, Juney!” proclaimed Rodney.

“Someone’s stealing our water, we’ve got a bill here for over $1000”

It’s believed that June initially wasn’t sure how to let Rodney know that she was in fact the reason for the astronomical water bill, not some non-existent water thieves. After a short pause she mustered the courage to reveal the truth.

“Ah, Rodders, darling… it wasn’t thieves”

“It was me, I’ve been trying to keep the garden alive”

At this point Rodney asked to know what the hell could need so much water.

“Have you lost your mind?”

“What garden uses $1000 worth of water in 3 months?”

“Are you growing bloody cotton out there?”

The Advocate has is on good authority that June is not growing cotton in her backyard, but rather a range of rare non-native species that require a considerably higher amount of water than most native species.

With Rodney now on to her, June is in a real panic about her garden. 

Reports say that she has been asking neighbours if she can syphon water from their water supply, which she will pay for at an inflated rate. 

It’s not yet known if and arrangements have been made.

Dart Break Ruined As Manager Joins In

TEXT:

What was meant to be a heart warming and lung destroying smoko between an inner circle of work colleagues turned to absolute shit as the manager joined the group, in a desperate attempt to socialise with the people who hate him.

It is believed Site Manager Daly Wayne (44) is yet to gain the respect of his crew, due to starting most conversations with ‘how’s tricks?’ and ending them with ‘alright, back to work now.’

In an act of carcinogenic defiance, many members of Wayne’s team have begun taking group dart breaks to treat their brains to sweet nicotine and their souls to whispered assertions that their boss is a total fuck.

All that changed earlier today at approximately 10:30 am, when Wayne chimed in on the dart break as if it were the most natural thing in the world.

“Anyone got a light?” he asked in a symbolic representation of his organisational skills.

“And a durry?”

Unable to say any of the things they really wanted to say during the smoke break, Wayne filled in the awkward silence with stories about his juvenile delinquency.

“Oi, did I ever tell you guys I saw Gunners when they came over in 94? I think I’ve already told you this story…I’ll say it anyway…”

Members of the usual smoke group stated that not only did Wayne deprive them all of an enjoyable escape from their daily duties but he failed to properly smoke the cigarette that was provided to him.

“Bum puffed the whole thing,” said dart provider Mitch Gere (29).

“I’ve got a deck of menthols at home I accidentally bought from a pub ciggie machine four years ago, he’s getting those from now on if he asks again. Dart-scabbing break-ruining short-man-syndrome little fuck.”

Retired Accountant Landlord Says He Should Be Right To Just Fix That Structural Fault Himself

TEXT:

Earlier this week residents of a French Quarter share house experienced the rare phenomenon of having a maintenance request answered.

It appears the residents may have celebrated too soon as their landlord, former accountant Geronimo Shah (68), says there is no need to involve contractors or the council, as he should be able to take care of the structural fault himself.

“I fix this thing all the time [sic],”  stated Shah as he eyed the deep crack running through the middle of the terrace house that  was functioning as a highly effective cockroach highway.

“Piece of easy cake.”

After climbing through the window into his 1992 Nissan NX, Shah drove home and returned with a wooden ladder duct taped to his roof and a friend who was  older than him who he introduced only as ‘Chief.’

Using Shah’s semi-runged ladder, the pair climbed to the ceiling of the terrace house and began filling the beginning of the crack that seemed to divide the home in two with used pieces of aluminium foil. 

“Now the water, it can’t get in.”

Following this, the pair took a break to smoke a packet of cigarettes each on the roof before rain began to fall, realising they couldn’t get down and having to construct a rope out of their shirts and trousers to abseil down the side of the house. 

Standing wet underneath his makeshift rope of clothes wearing only his underwear, Shah informed the tenants the work was done and asked if they wouldn’t mind paying rent in cash this week.

“All done, fixed. Now who has the money?”

Man Invited Into Corporate Box Reckons He Could Get Used To This

A local cheapskate has peaked in life today after being invited into a corporate box at the Betoota Cricket Ground. 

He shared the news with his Instagram followers by uploading a story consisting of a close up shot of a crisp schooner on a table, with the rest of the grandstand and pitch slightly out of focus in the background, with a caption saying, ‘I could get used to this.’

The Advocate managed to catch up with Jim van Bix sometime after this post while he was out in the concourse having a cigarette.

“Fuck, I can’t believe these boxes have been sitting here the whole time.”

“This is just so grouse.”

“I don’t think I’ve even watched any of the cricket.”

“I’m just in there scoffing down all those Peking Duck pancakes, fuck they’re good!”

After doing some further digging, The Advocate discovered that about 80% of people who attend corporate boxes and upload proof of it on to social media, are in fact free-loading. 

The other 20% are men on bucks’ parties who have all pooled their money together.

It’s not yet known whether Jim will receive the call up to next week’s game.

“What makes you think that you’re a better swimmer than me?” asked Joel.

“In primary school I was age-champion for swimming every single year, I was so fast people thought I had gills and flippers!”

“Your sporting achievements hold about as much value as your bloody crypto portfolio, mate.”

“And I don’t think I’d be skiting about either of those things if I were you,” said Joel before bursting into another fit of laughter.

Report: Nothing More Sweaty Than An Ex-Queenslander Visiting Home After Acclimatising Down South

A recent report looking what the world’s sweatiest thing is has revealed that something in Australia has taken out the prized number one spot – even ahead of a taxi driver in an ’89 Camry driving through Texas with the windows up and no air-con.

In what can only be described as a great honour for Queenslanders, the report found that there is nothing on Earth more sweaty than an ex-Queenslander visiting home for the weekend, after he’s acclimatised to the temperature of his current southern state.

The Advocate can confirm that one ex-Queenslander in particular, Carl Engle (29), was named in the report as being the sweatiest living organism.

Our reporters caught up with Carl to see how he feels about winning Australia the sweaty honour, and, true to form, Carl had sweat dripping off his out of shape body.

“Fark, it’s hot here!”

“I don’t remember it being this hot.”

“How are you not sweating?” Carl asked as he used his shirt to wipe the  sweat off his brow.

“Yeah so I suppose it’s great that I’ve won something for Australia, but at the same time, my mates won’t stop paying me out.”

“They’re just in my ear about how much of a pussy I’ve become, so I guess the victory is bitter sweet.”

Local Class Traitor Sits In The Back Seat Of The Uber Like It’s A Limo

A local bartender has today indicated that he thinks he is far too important to share his personal space with another shift worker.

After booking a ride home after a few afternoon beers with coworkers at the pub they all work at, Todd Comino (22) has opted to spend big and book a 2012 Hyundai Accent Sport 1.6 Hatch Model home to his six-person sharehouse in Betoota’s French Quarter – which is roughly 4 kilometres away – and easily walkable.

Saving himself roughly 18 minutes by ‘booking a car’ instead of just waiting for the bus, Todd is making sure he makes the most of every cent of the $9.52 that this ride usually averages out to be.

Firstly, he’s making sure the driver has the air con on, because it’s hot outside and he’s not going to pay 43% of his hourly wage to sit in a hot car.

Two, he’s going to request that the driver puts the radio on 96.5 Desert Rock FM, because as an young unpaid creative, he won’t settle for talkback over some of the hottest tunes in the Channel Country.

And three, he’s getting in the back seat, because after spending the last eight hours being paid a barely liveable wage to run plates back and forth from the TAB to the pub kitchen, he’s not about to have yet another conversation with a friendly Nepali man on his own dollar.

At time of press, Todd was seen listening to the Joe Rogan interview with Elon Musk through his $500 noise cancelling headphones that he recklessly bought using AfterPay two weeks before arriving at his family Christmas with no presents for mum.

Busy Co-Worker Hoping Someone Notices Them Having Lunch At Their Desk

Lisa Hughes (37) reached dizzying heights of busy today, as the ambiguously titled Office Administrator ate lunch at her desk, something she hopes her co-workers will take notice of.

At approximately 12 pm today, Hughes was seen heating her lunch up in the office microwave, muttering to herself about all the things she has to do, before walking her lunch past the empty lunch table and eating it at her cubicle desk.

“No, it’s fine, what’s up?” stated Hughes as a co-worker who came to ask her a question noticed she was eating lunch.

“Didn’t even get time to heat it up all the way through.”

Following what pundits are calling the ‘desk lunch affair,’ Hughes went to the kitchen and loudly complained about the mess in the sink, before audibly cleaning it and explaining that she doesn’t have time to do it to every person who entered the kitchen during that period.

“Busy, busy. I’ve got to finish last month’s reports, authorise my bloody expenses and ask IT to send me a new keyboard because mine keeps getting jammed.”

Internet In First World Country Brought To Its Knees By Afternoon Shower

Productivity has plummeted even further at a firm in the Old City District today thanks to a run of the mill afternoon shower.

Despite the fact that pretty much everyone has stopped turning up to work, Celia Ho unfortunately still has a couple of meetings and jobs she needs to finish before the Christmas break.

The Accounts Manager at a firm in the city explained that her progress on some painful brief ground to a sudden halt moments ago as an early afternoon shower set in.

While her work doesn’t require her to be in the outdoors, the rain has successfully brought the internet in the office to a standstill.

Sitting at her desk, Ho told us that despite the fact she lives in a first world country with relatively good infrastructure, her work is constantly affected by the appalling quality of the internet.

“I can’t even compare it to some Eastern European country, because their internet is most likely better than ours,” Ho said.

“I just tried to google a question and I can’t even load the landing page.”

“All it takes is an afternoon downpour for the internet to be crippled. It’s frailer than a Tuesday morning post-Splendour attendee.”

Ho explained that she has probably had enough.

“I’m not fucking hot-spotting, because I’ve gone over my data for the 10th time this year.”

“I think I might go home.”

Man Throws Group Chat Commitmentphobes Under The Bus By Proposing

TEXT:

A local man has caused headaches for all of his friends today.

The late 20-something-man named Ben Thomspon has done so by deciding to propose to his long-term girlfriend.

His proposal this afternoon to his soon-to-be wife has caused tremors amongst his friendship group.

The tremors stem from the fact that Thompson’s actions have now put all of his friends and their girlfriends on notice.

“What the fuck did he have to go and do that for,” said one member of the group chat to us this afternoon.

The 28-year-old friend who placated his girlfriend of 4 years with a dog earlier this year explained that Thompson’s actions have far reaching effects.

“Obviously I’m sort of happy for him.”

“They are a great couple and are made for each other.”

“But he’s fucked the rest of his by proposing.”

The local commitmentphobe explained that by asking the love of his life to marry him, Thompson has inadvertently caused unwanted probing questions and increasing pressure to be piled upon the other members of the group.

“The smile my girlfriend gave me when I told her said it all,” said the friend.

“My days are numbered unless I decide to take a knee and ask her as soon I think.”

Agency Suit Awkwardly Laughs At Something He Was 65% Sure Required A Laugh

TEXT:

Sitting in a meeting at a local marketing agency, Simon Harper, a soulless suit, has just laughed at what he’s pretty sure is a joke told by his client, Emma.

In the real world, the attempt at humour would be met with crickets, however, in this instance, Simon was required to laugh – well, he thinks he was meant to.

“Good one, Emma!”

“You’re so right, contracts are annoying,” he said to the client.

The Advocate caught up with Simon shortly after the incident took place to see how he lives with himself, knowing how much of a coward he has become.

“It’s not easy, let me tell you,” Simon said.

“I have to kiss ass all day, I just laughed at a joke that I’m not even sure was a joke.”

“I just get in there on auto-pilot. My father would be so disappointed if he knew the man I have become.”

“He raised me to be a leader, not a loser [sigh].”

When questioned about what the alleged humour was, Simon was unable to answer.

“I dunno, she’s such a pain so I just switch off – as I said, auto-pilot.”

Our reporter reached out to Emma, the client, to see what her perspective on the whole situation was and whether she has any inkling that Simon hates his job and himself.

“Simon is such a great guy, but between you and me, I’m pretty sure he has a crush on me,” she said.

“I told the shittest joke before and he laughed at it.”

Boring Man Who Really Isn’t Of Much Interest To Anyone Puts Tape Over Webcam

TEXT:

Ambiguously titled IT Technician Bevan Blake (33) has protected the privacy of his uninteresting life by sticking a piece of tape over his webcam.

Known throughout his company for promising to provide IT support and occasionally showing up to do it, Blake is now gaining a reputation as somewhat of a tinfoil hat type who thinks the government wants to hack into his webcam to watch him at work.

“I use a VPN. I can install one on your computer later today,” lied Blake.

“The foil you can install yourself though. Kek.”

Those close to Blake say they are unsure why he feels the need to take low-tech preventative measures to protect himself from potential hackers as the most dangerous thing he has ever done was drive a car while a loose can of V rolled around on the floor.

“Keep in mind it might not just be the Australian government who wants to hack in. That’s why all my files are in English, so the Russians can’t read them.”

Friends of Blake are quick to point out that if Russian intelligence did hack into Blake’s computer and read his Harry Potter fan fiction, they would be the first people to do so.

“It’s just Harry Potter set in Japan. It’s not even creative and it’s pretty offensive to be honest,” stated a source close to Blake.

“And if they hacked his webcam to catch him wanking, they better get some extra hard drives to save that footage on because they’re gonna get terabytes worth.”

Responding to these comments, Blake pointed out that hackers will not be able to see him pleasuring himself due to the foil over his webcam and claims there is nothing offensive about his fan fiction.

“You Need To See The World,” Says Woman Who Spent 3 Weeks Blind Drunk In Europe Ten Years Ago

TEXT:

Work colleague Tracey Rhiannon (34) may have overstepped some boundaries this week by telling younger co-workers they “need to see the world” – like she did when she spent three weeks blind drunk in Europe ten years ago.

Aged beyond her years, Rhiannon occasionally feels the need to state that her age makes her a wise and experienced individual and not a grumpy old lady full of unwarranted information that her younger colleagues in no way asked for.

“When I went to Greece it was still actually Greece,” stated Rhiannon, referring to the 31 hours she spent in Athens switching between drunk and hungover.

“Happy memories. I think.”

Colleagues of Rhiannon report her travel recommendations consist mostly of whatever Lonely Planet says is good that year and the pubs she got smashed in on the Contiki tour she took back when Kevin Rudd was Prime Minister for the first time.

“I have a travel bug, I booked my next cruise on my last cruise!”

In an exclusive with The Advocate, Rhiannon revealed more about her recent travel history which consists entirely of cruises she takes with her friend Christine, documented by a series of pairs portraits on her desk, each with increasing levels of slack-eyedness.

“That one [P&O 2013] I don’t know if we even left the boat! I don’t remember taking that photo! Haha, it was great.”

Local Tradie Refers To Picturesque Location As “Today’s Office”

TEXT:

A local chippy has let his social media followers know that they should be pretty jealous of him today.

Kayden James (23) did so by posting a photo of the picturesque location he is working at and titling it ‘Todays Office.’

The young man uploaded the photo from a location on the coast today where he and his boss are working on a little annexe.

James told us that the post on his socials was just a cheeky uplifting shot to show off how nice the place he is working at is.

“Yeah just good to let my friends and family know that I’m leaving the dream out here today,” James said.

“Especially those of my followers who are pen pushing drones who stare at the same cubicle wall every day of the week.”

“Honestly, couldn’t do that mate,” he laughed to us.

“Just plug myself into the same booth every day and go through the motions like that. Couldn’t work in an office,” said the man who never has and like he said never will work in an office.

James then told us he had to get back to it as his boss was off the phone and looking for the young man.

We spoke to one of James’ office mates about the upload today and he explained that the location did look nice.

“Yeah, beautiful view, beautiful day, good on him.”

“He’s right, it’s better than sitting in this same fucking desk that I’ve been sitting in for the last two years.”

Uber Driver Shifting Through Automatic Transmission Like He’s Driving A B-Double Up A Hill

TEXT:

Pulling up at the lights on Greens Road in Betoota Heights, local Uber driver Bill Stroker clunked his late model automatic Holden Cruze in park as the lights turned red.

His passenger, Butter Waterford, was confused.

She thought long and hard as to why he’d done that. Where they about to get out and walk the rest of the way? Who knows?

Speaking to The Advocate this morning, the popular city worker said she was left without answers because when it boiled down to it, she didn’t really care that much.

“It’s still strange though,” she said.

“Has it happened to anybody else before? When an Uber driver comes to a halt in traffic or something, they put the fucking car in park? I’ve never seen that before.”

And if that wasn’t already bad enough, she says, when they got moving again, he put the thing into the tiptronic bay and flicked himself up and down through the gears.

“Like he was Ayrton fucking Senna, it was crazy. I thought those things were only there for show,”

“He was acting like the only thing that separated him from Senna was the fact that a bolt wasn’t about to come flying through the window and put him into the back of the big Uber in the sky!”

“This planet has gone and got itself in a big hurry, Errol. It’s too much for an old 23-year-old account executive like me.”

Pathetic Sook Looking Forward To Abusing Airline Staff Who Weigh His Carry-On

TEXT:

Sadly, the bollards are still bolted to the ground at Remienko International Aerodrome after the unpleasantness in Sydney all those years ago.

However, that fact is largely being credited with saving the life of a remarkably unpopular city worker today after he abused a female staff member because she said the man’s bag is overweight and would have to be checked.

Members of the public were seen attempting to lift bollards up to stop Dale Peter Sampson from yelling at the polite and professional ticketing clerk sitting behind the FrugalFlyer desk, who was allegedly on the verge of tears.

The Advocate can reveal that Sampson, a freelance photographer, had told friends he was looking forward to abusing the airline staff if they weighed his bag – which topped out at a whopping 14kg.

However, AFP officers were luckily on hand to defuse the situation with a length of reo bar and a set of plastic handcuffs.

With a swift crack, the 28-year-old was turned off at the wall like a French protestor and his lifeless body was carried out through a secret door beside the oversize luggage conveyor.

Dale is said to be in a stable condition in Betoota Base Hospital with a skull fracture, cranial lacerations and a reattached tongue that was bitten off after his chin collided with the polish concrete floor when the focus of his anger shifted to the overalled lawmen.

Man Railroaded Into Complimenting Friend’s Weird-Looking Baby

TEXT:

A French Quarter man has confided in The Advocate today about something that happened to him on the weekend that left him with an odd feeling in his stomach.

Dylan Westacott said he was railroaded into complimenting his friend’s strange-looking baby on Saturday afternoon at a Christmas barbeque – something he says creeped him out.

“That kid gives me the heebeejeebees,” he said.

“I know what you’re thinking, it might be a birth defect or something but we’ve asked them and they said no with a mild look of offence on their face,”

“What they do is is that come up and say hi and everything, then try to get the little freak to say high but he’s nine months old so he just looks at you with those big googly eyes while he loads his britches! Then they’re like, ‘Isn’t he a big handsome boy these days?’ and you just have to stand there and say, ‘Oh me, oh my, yes he is! He’s going to be such a looker in a few years!'”

“It’s all lies. What can you do? Can someone tell me?”

“So how was it?” he asked.

“Great, it was really fun.”

“How was the music?” he asked.

“Great, it was really fun.”

With her EmuPass still on the floor of a rented Hyundai iMax outside Betoota Airport, Lucy Steerson was forced to buy another one this morning just so she’d be able to get the bus to work.

This weekend gone, the 26-year-old Virgo and a few close friends made the trip out to The West-By-Windorah Festival on the mail plane where they say they had the time of their young lives.

Speaking this Monday morning to The Advocate, Lucy said she’s still not sure if she actually had fun or not – judging by the way she’s currently feeling.

“We’ve all been there before right?” she said.

“Will I ever feel joy again? Are all my efforts in life in vain? Why do I even bother? Jesus Christ, don’t print any of that. What the hell is wrong with me? I don’t even know you; why am I telling you this?”

“Everyone at work is laughing at me and asking all these really involved questions that I simply cannot answer right now. Why are they like this? I’m never doing drugs again.”

Watching Lucy’s internal battle from afar was a fellow sales team member, John Forkman, who also took time out of his busy morning of doing fuck all to speak to our reporter about Lucy’s ongoing battle to not suddenly burst out in tears.

“I remember my first festival,” he laughed, condescendingly.

“She’ll be right. She just needs to get some bananas into her. Maybe even some salmon? I’m actually quite impressed she came in today. If I went to West-By-Windorah, I would’ve taken a sick day, that’s for sure.”

Power-Tripping Coworker Chooses Shitty Xmas Party Venue That Caters To Her Cigarette Habit

TEXT:

The entire workplace of Lorigan And Co Accountants in Betoota Heights have today been treated to the news that next week’s staff Christmas party will be at one of the grossest pubs in the area.

Mainly due to the fact that Lanny from the front desk loves punching darts, and is also in charge of organising the event.

Whispers started circulating as early as yesterday that the event was going to take place at the Betoota Heights Tavern.

“Isn’t that where all the fights happen?” asked Bill, a graduate employee.

“That’s a pretty rough venue, Lanny” he said.

Lanny, who appeared shocked that anyone would care where the 5-hour office piss up was going to hosted, insists that the tavern had a really nice kitchen.

“Excuse me” she said.

“But I don’t see anyone else putting their hands up to organise this”

“The Heights Tavern is a lovely venue with plenty of space”

And by space, she means the infamous DOSA [designated smokers area], which kind of blends into the outdoor dining area, and won’t be an awkward place for her to punch some sweet sweet Benson and Hedges.

One of the partners, Sandra, interjects on behalf of everybody.

“Lanny didn’t some guy get killed with an ashtray in that beer garden a few months back?”

Sandra is quick to reign it in after Lanny gets that look in her eyes, a look that is only seen about once or twice a year when the boss’ son double parks out the back.

“Ok. I’ll cancel the booking. If it’s not flash enough for you lot! Fine”

At time of press everyone was telling Lanny that it was fine and that they got confused with another venue but that this one is actually good.

“Coal Is Technically Vegan And Organic” Says Inner-City Leftie Justifying Purchase Of Tesla

TEXT:

A semi-retired geologist is at the centre of a localised firestorm this today after he attempted to justify the purchase of a used Tesla motorcar by saying coal is technically vegan and organic.

Betoota Grove resident Gregor Spearson, who was once so moved by the slaughter of whales by the Japanese that he bought a bumper sticker for his late-model Citroen wagon,  was responding to claims made by an intellectually-superior conservative neighbour that he’s ‘dodgem car’ doesn’t help the environment at all because it’s charged by the local Euromanga Basin Coal Power Plant.

“It’s also fair trade coal because it is of Australian origin,” said the 57-year-old.

“We pay or mining workers fairly. But technically, coal is an organic substance and also vegan! But I don’t recommend eating it! [laughs]”

But his aging neighbour, Colin Rogerson, was not laughing.

The School of Hard Knocks alumnus and graduate of The University of Life knows a thing or two about electric cars, he tells our reporter, and none of those things is good.

In fact, Colin says he often gets worked up whenever he sees Gregor’s Tesla and feels it sneaks up on him as he’s walking his unmicrochipped Staffie down the street.

He spoke to our reporter about his issue with the car a short time ago.

“Nearly all the rare earth minerals that go into those batteries come from the Central African Republic where they’re mined by child slaves and traded by warlords,” he said, smirking.

“I’d rather drive my EL Falcon that was made by a proud man in Geelong called Dave or Brett. She’s got 740 000 km on her clock and her inline-six still runs like a Baby-G. I know that think Gregor has goes like a shower of shit and can drag a chisel plough down a highway but at what cost?”

Colin then went to spit but it didn’t come out right and it ended up dribbling onto his Souths jersey.

“Ah Christ!”

Our reporter elected to leave after that.

Pub Raconteur’s Story Ruined By Mate’s Mate Googling Everything

“Who was that cunt and why did you bring him to the pub last night?”

At 6:04 am this morning, the first message buzzed the group chat and Nick Friesen wanted some answer.

The Diamantina Air Freight pilots often meet on a Tuesday afternoon for a quiet drink at the Dickless Parrot in Betoota Heights, which was once a nice shithole to drink in before Justin Hemmes bought it and made it into a popular eatery complete with prams and seafood.

Once there, Nick and his fellow flyboys like to relax and tell wild stories from the frontier country as well as yarns passed between friends like gastro in a boarding house.

However, there was a small problem yesterday which took the shine off the evening, according to Nick.

“So John brings this poon he went to school with who was not good company in the slightest,” he said.

Nick spoke to The Advocate this morning as he filled his Rav4 Boomer Wagon up at the Daroo Street Caltex.

“Every time we’d start spinning a yarn, he’d start fact checking what we were saying. Does he understand the concept of getting a few cold schooners in you and telling your friends stories that aren’t entirely factually correct? It seems he does not,”

“So I told this timeless yarn I have about this bloke drinking 100 stubbies of heavy in a single sitting. He’s pulled me up saying that’s like 40 litres of beer and about 140 standard drinks. A stranger at the table, he had the gall to call me a liar!”

“We all looked at John and he’s suddenly realised that he as fucked up big time by bringing this fucking dork to the pub with him, so he says he has to go, thinking that this spoon would follow him,”

“But he didn’t. We got stuck with him. So we all ended up leaving. Mate, I can’t begin to tell you how annoyed I am.”

After flagellating herself all morning for being born middle-class to two polite and stable property owners, a happy-go-lucky city worker has had to endure said parents moaning and complaining that their hyper-inflated asset is now sharply decreasing in value.

Joining her folks for lunch this Tuesday gone, Emile Seymour said aside from the normal questions about her life and why it seems so aimless, she also had to sit through her aging parents saying they’re on the way to the poor house if the housing market crashes.

“I know, it’s bad,” she said.

Her mother, Bucket, rolled her eyes.

“Oh how would you know? You live week to week and spend every last cent you make on silly things like takeout dinners and wine!”

Just as Emile was about to retort, he father explained that times are different and things are harder for young people now.

Deverill Seymour, however, failed to redeem himself in the eyes of his daughter because he said the current housing woes facing young people are ‘Gough Whitlam’s fault’ because he opened the door to rampant and unsustainable immigration.

“So taking all the above into account,” said Emile.

Kidnapper’s Girlfriend Tired Of Having Her Magazines Cut Up For Ransom Letters

TEXT:

After years of silent compliance Susanne,* girlfriend of career kidnapper Brody,* has stated she is tired of having her magazines cut up and used for ransom letters.

Throughout their four year relationship, Susanne has enjoyed certain aspects of being the partner of a career kidnapper but has struggled in silence with others.

“I put up with a lot, his late starts, the noise from the cellar, never being able to ever use the car boot,” stated Susanne as she held a mangled magazine of hers.

“But enough is enough. This was the last ever issues of Australian Cosmopolitan he just cut up. Where am I supposed to get sex tips now?”

According to Brody, he requires the letters from his girlfriend’s magazines to send untraceable ransom notes to the family of his kidnap victims as he still hasn’t figured out how to set up his wireless printer up correctly.

“I don’t like printed notes anyway, no tradition, where’s the respect for the victim’s families?” he stated as he cut the P off the cover of Peppermint magazine, pasting it with care to form the word ‘pay.’

“She pays for these with the money I earn from ransom, so really it’s just a bit of give and take. That’s just the line of work.”

Brody’s excuses for the trauma he has caused to Susanne by cutting up her magazines are not good enough according to Susanne, who would much rather he write the notes with his left hand or use letters from his car magazines.

“I don’t want to hear it, some of those magazines are very valuable! I’ve got one with Clarkson on the front, that’s got to be worth something. I wonder how much you could get for kidnapping him? You’d need two roles of duct tape for his mouth alone I reckon,” Brody said.

For Susanne, this is no matter that can be solved with a high profile kidnapping and she is demanding that Brody either stop dissecting her magazines or propose to her like they’ve talked about.

Curious Man Wonders How Perennially-Empty Travel Agency In Local Strip Mall Stays Afloat

A popular local thinking man has been bamboozled by a Betoota Heights travel agency this afternoon because despite never seeing anybody in it ever, it still manages to remain open.

When he’s not enjoying a fine prepackaged lasagne with friends in his rented one-bedroom apartment, Kane Mooch applies his oversized brain to academia down the South Betoota Polytechnic College Music Department.

The 27-year-old can play Liszt’s La Campanella from memory, after a short warm up, he says.

He’s brought two Tinder and six Bumble dates home with him this year – just so they could hear and see him play Debussy’s Clair De Lune – seconds after ripping a Kosciusko-sized cone in front of them with his water-pipe named ‘Elliot Carver’ after his favourite Bond villain.

“But,” he said. “That all pales in comparison to the Betoota Heights Flight Centre.”

Kane spoke to The Advocate this afternoon about his constant amazement at the store and its ability to have no customers, ever.

“I’m sure they do have customers, from time to time. But I’ve never actually seen one in there, like ever. Do people still go to travel agents? Do people still think it’s 1994 and Michael Jackson is still throwing shamonas around like they’re run-of-the-mill tee-hees?”

Unsupervised Boomer Finds Himself Watching SBS Food Again

TEXT:

A Betoota Grove father-of-four has been left to his own devices this morning, something that the sexagenarian relishes and enjoys.

Colin Dollarhyde is using the lack of spousal supervision to his advantage, he says, by sitting himself down on his new Koala lounge in front of the ‘idiot box’.

In particular, SBS Food.

Speaking a short time ago to The Advocate via telephone, the surprisingly virile Gemini said he somehow always ends up enjoying food channels more than others.

“I enjoy watching Nigella,” he said.

“It is much easier to watch than the others. Rick Stein is OK but he looks ill. Bourdain is always great but it makes me sad now. Don’t get me started on Jamie Oliver. Honest to Christ, he must live in an alternate universe where things take a quarter of the time to do as they do in our dimension,”

“I respect Gordon Ramsey; because I think he’d be able to fuck me up if we ever got into a fight. But yes. Nigella is my favourite. Do you need me to spell it out for you? I don’t think so.”

However, Dollarhyde said he can only enjoy these shows unsupervised.

He told our reporter that his wife and kids often ‘give him stick’ for enjoying Nigella’s shows as much as he does.

Late last year, Colin said he was caught watching Nigella’s Christmas Special by his wife and eldest daughter, who both rolled their eyes at him and called him a ‘creepy old man’.

“That’s the thanks you get for putting a roof over their head, putting them through two private schools because of their upper-middle-class problems with authority. Putting them through a ceramics course at the tech college because that’s their passion. Sometimes I wish I voted for Kim Beazley so I’d be poor now. Oh well.”

Phone Addiction Realised After Attempt To Set Alarm Results In 30 Minute Social Media Scroll

Local woman Alyshia Stephenson has just come to after losing 30 minutes of her life down a social media black hole.

Dazed and confused, Alyshia sat there wondering what the hell happened.

“I just went on there [my phone] to set an alarm,” she said.

“I don’t even know what happened.”

This type of behaviour is quite a common occurrence amongst millennials who have developed a dependency on their smartphones.

“Shit, these big tech corps have got me, my brain just took me to their app on autopilot, I’m addicted!”

Just as those words escaped Alyshia’s mouth, our Zuckerberg Boner-metre went crazy. He has got another one hooked.

Woman Deletes Message From Stranger In Hopes Of Removing Drunken Friendship From Memory

TEXT:

Ellen Sobrata has woken this morning with more than just an alcoholic hangover.

She’s also experiencing sharp pangs of anxiety brought on by the fact that she gave her phone number to a complete stranger she met at a trendy Betootan rooftop bar.

Ellen was reminded of the number exchange as she scrolled through her messages and saw an ‘X’ at the end of a message to a boy she didn’t recognise.

“I look forward to a plutonic catch-up X” read the message she sent to someone by the name of Rhylie Louboski.

Upon reading this Ellen immediately deleted the message, desperately trying to erase from her mind whatever fragmented memory was swirling around in there.

The Advocate reached out to Ellen to see how she’s feeling about the whole encounter and whether or not the shame of her drunken message to Rhylie had been disposed of or not.

“Mmm no, it definitely hasn’t.”

“Yuck, just the thought of it gives me shivers, who the fuck was Rhylie?”

“And why was I having a plutonic catch up with him?”

“There are so many questions I need answered but at the same time definitely don’t want answered.”

“I think I might just try to bury this one with the slut dropping incident at my work party.”

Waitress Backs Herself Without Pen Or Paper

TEXT:

Patrons of French Quarter cafe The Almond Teet, have been left anxious and confused as waitress Jess Hamilton (26) has begun relying heavily on her memory skills and is taking orders without a pen and paper.

Since opening in 2015, The Almond Teet is a proudly alternate food destination that according to it’s mission statement, likes to do things a bit differently, serving the exact same type of over-priced food on mismatched plates as every other cafe in the gentrified neighbourhood.

In an extension of the cafe’s relaxed atmosphere, many of the wait staff elect to take their orders without a pen and paper, causing an unwanted side-effect as the diners practice the speech they will make when they are inevitably delivered the wrong thing.

Ever-confident, Hamilton states her diners need not worry as she has the cognitive function necessary to commit an order to memory.

“I am an actor, I can recite whole Shakespeare scripts, pretty sure I can remember if someone asked for coconut milk,” stated Hamilton with a thespian’s flair.

“All the staff here are actors actually, that must be why we always remember our orders.”

It is unknown at this time whether the all-actor wait staff is another gimmick initiated by The Almond Teet or if it is a cold reminder of the impenetrably scarce work available in the performing arts.

Disappointment As Mum Reveals Christmas This Year Is With The Weird Cousins

A bubbly Betoota Grove sexagenarian has taken time out of her busy afternoon of smoking cigarillos on the deck and watering the geraniums while they’re in direct sunlight to ring her children to say that Christmas this year is with the weird cousins.

“We’re spending it with my husband’s cousins. He’s an only child,” she said, moments before letting out an earthshattering cough.

“Yes they are pretty weird but they’re family none the less. One thing I do know is that the kids don’t really like them that much,”

“They’d much rather go to my brother’s house because he has a pool and his kids and mine are around the same age. But he’s going to Yamba this year with his boys so we didn’t have much choice other than the Betoota Heights cousins. There’s always next year.”

Our reporter also spoke to Colin Jr, who said he doesn’t have much in common with his father’s cousin’s family and that he finds them to be ‘a full-time job’.

He told The Advocate that he always feels the need to be on because they keep asking him questions and fail to pick up on the many social cues one can give when they want a conversation to end and never start again.

“They’re always ‘on’, you know what I mean?” he said.

“Like just, don’t ask me questions when I’ve got a mouthful of food. What cunt? Do you want to wait 90 seconds for an answer while I chew? And nobody smokes. Except for Mum. And then they have the gall to give us shit for it,”

“Saying it’ll kill us. Well fuck me, bring on the Spanish Dancer if it means it’ll get me away from you quicker! Actually, I don’t mean that. Christmas should be OK. But I’m not drinking and we’re leaving at 5 on the dot.”

Local 30-Something Viewed Quite Differently By Peers After Learning He Can’t Drive

TEXT:

Day broke by the Lake Betoota Boatramp this morning as three local shift workers reversed their beloved Quintrex into the deep and majestic waters of Western Queensland’s deepest body of water.

Moments after the hull slid off the rollers, skipper Sam Davison threw the keys to his ex-cab EL Falcon to one of his mates to park the car and trailer.

However, the keys just happened to land in Gregor Redpath’s hands.

He looked down at the keys in his cupped hands then back up at Sam.

“Can you park her for me? Phil and I will bring her round to the jetty,” yelled Sam.

Gregor pursed his lips and thought about trying it for a second. That by some grace of God, he’d be able to summon the ability to reverse park a trailer when he’d never even sat for his learner plates.

But no.

“I can’t,” he replied.

“You can’t what? Are you disqualified? Fuck it, mate. There’s no jacks here.”

Again, a part of Gregor died.

“I can’t drive.”

Both Phil and Sam, now slowly drifting backwards in the still lake, stood in silence as they let the news sink in.

“Oh,” said Phil.

“Wait there, I’ll come do it.”

Speaking to The Advocate this afternoon, Sam said that they never knew that young Gregor didn’t have a licence. They just expected him to have one because he’s 33-years-old.

“How does he live?” Sam asked our reporter.

“How does he get to work? Or go shopping? Or get across town? He went to Whooton. Whooton boys don’t get the bus or the train,”

“It’s so weird. I definitely see him in a different light now. I used to think he was a handy, useful, red-blooded male. Not anymore.”

Our reporter spoke briefly with Gregor, who said he absolutely hates it when his biggest secret comes out like it did this morning.

“It is a source of immense shame for me,” he said.

“Truth is, I just never got around to it. And the older I got, the more embarrassing it was for me to seek help. Imagine asking a coworker to help you get your hours up as a 33-year-old? You’d be cactus!”

“What do I do?”

Our reporter shrugged and clicked the recorder off.

Healthy Option From Work Cafe Once Again Fails To Hit The Spot After Way Too Many Chances

TEXT:

A investigation has reported that the healthy wrap from the work cafe has failed to hit the spot for the 22nd time.

Wanting to spread her wings during her strictly monitored lunch hour, employee Gina Kidman (33) elected to visit the ‘Business Park Kafe,’ a venue that meets her criteria of being 50 metres away from her desk and unremarkable enough that she can visit everyday guilt free.

“What can I get you?” asked the cafe staff who knew exactly what Kidman was going to order but pretend not to know her every time they see her.

Perusing through the selection of pre-packaged lunch options, Kidman purchased a grilled prawn and vegie wrap after briefly toying with the idea of eating something she might actually enjoy.

Upon finishing her lunch the Sales Director confirmed that she was almost satisfied with her healthy wrap for what is reported to be her 22nd time.

“Might have to have a piece of fruit with it next time,” stated Kidman for the 22nd time.

“Or like, they used to soups here. I don’t mind soup if it isn’t too creamy”

“Or maybe I should take the days that I forget to pack lunch as an opportunity to treat myself with something fucked”

“Hey, That Looks Pretty Easy” Says Local Deadshit About To Try Fly Fishing For The First Time

TEXT:

Yesterday morning around 9, Peter Midas’ phone rang and on the other end of the line was Liam Cruikshank.

Liam is a keen fisherman with a particular penchant for the fly fishing variety, however, he seldom finds people willing to stand alone with him in a local river for hours on end.

Which is why, on a bright Monday morning, Peter rang the Betoota Heights property manager at his desk to invite him out for a day of fly fishing this Saturday.

But Peter had never fly fished before – he’d never even thought about it until now. In saying that, Peter loves to game fish out in the open ocean. The sun, surf and unabridged consumption of bargain basement beer on a multi-million dollar game boat.

Speaking to our reporter this morning, Peter said he agreed on the spot.

“Yew! What a way to spend your Saturday! How good?” he asked, rhetorically.

“Pulling brownies out of the Cooper. Liam’s even got all the gear for me, too. Told me not to bring a thing. So yeah, that means all I need to bring is the piss. Some mutha-fuckin al-co-hol! Woo-hoo!”

“How hard can it be? Just a bit of back and forth with the old wrist and there you go, a big brownie in your net.”

Our reporter, in the interests of balance, decided to speak to Liam as well about the upcoming Saturday on the Cooper.

And what The Advocate uncovered will chill you to your very core.

“No, it’s actually quite hard,” he said.

“That and you can’t really do it pissed because it takes a great amount of dexterity and coordination. There’s really not much it has in common with game fishing,”

“But I understand Peter enjoys all types of fishing. He said he hasn’t tried to fly fish before but we’ll see how it goes. I bet he’ll love it.”

Senate Inquiry Concludes Vintage Sunglasses Are In Vogue This Summer

TEXT:

A Federal Senate inquiry into the reemergence of vintage sunglasses this spring has all but confirmed that the fashion accessory is back in fashion this summer.

The news was met with mild fanfare this morning in Canberra, with Greens leader Richard Di Natale yelling across the chamber to his Conservative colleague Cori Bernardi: “Strike a pose, you straight-laced bitch!”

The findings are set to trigger an explosion in the finite resource.

Local retailers are already struggling to keep up with demand, which is leading some grey-market manufacturers to produce counterfeit vintage eyewear.

However, just what styles of vintage sunglasses are back in fashion is a mystery.

Speaking exclusively to The Advocate this morning, Richard Di Natale said this was just another example of how the parliament is always working in the best interests of the people.

“This is probably the most productive and important bits of research this parliament has done this year,” he said.

“And people said 2017 was a bad year. By Joh, this one has been pretty average as well! But the findings of this Senate Inquiry will give Australians of all walks of life the confidence to wear vintage eyewear this summer with impunity,”

“In saying that, is this week the last sitting week? I’m stuffed.”

“Don’t Talk To Me About Oppression!”: Charity Mugger Receives Tongue-Lashing From Wallabies Fan

TEXT:

An overly-polite and softly-manner door-knocking charity worker has been yelled off a Betoota Grove property this morning after he attempted to speak to the homeowner about the many oppressed peoples the world.

Rather than receiving a stern but nice ‘no’ from the man, Duncan Pegg got an absolute tongue-lashing.

Duncan, who has been collecting monies for the Exploit The Kindness Foundation for about a month, alleges that he was called ‘a whole manner of horrible names’ by John Foxley, who stayed up late last night to watch the Wallabies go down yet again.

Witness say an irate Foxley was ‘yelling and screaming’ at Pegg, who was bidding a hasty retreat back through the lush front yard.

“Get off my property, you fucking leech!” he yelled, allegedly.

“Go get a real job. Contribute the economy, you soft-eyed dildo! Fuck mate, you’re letting life give you a Turkish drill press! Get off my lawn, it’s Sir Walter!”

“Don’t talk to me about oppression! I’m a fucking Wallabies fan!”

The Advocate has reached out to Mr Foxley for comment but he has yet to reply as his lawyer’s office isn’t open until Monday.

The jacks at Betoota Grove Police Station were notified of the disturbance but ultimately decided ‘it wasn’t worth getting off the couch for’.

Supermarket Lasagne Slowly Defrosting On Kitchen Bench Says Mum’s Clocked Off For The Day

The shoes are off and the Austar IQ is working double time.

Brenda Matthews is ‘fucking’ done for the day.

Four ice-cubes clang against the tempered glass of her chardonnay chalice as the 21-year-old* spoke to our reporter through the screen door of her rendered brick four-bedroom McMansion in Betoota Heights this afternoon.

From all accounts, the popular high school principal has had an absolute ‘cunt of a week’ and she’s glad to see the back of it.

However, as a working mother of three, her responsibilities, unfortunately, didn’t end when she pointed her late model Land Rover Freelander 2 toward the car park gate at South Betoota Sports High around 5pm today – they ended when dinner was on the table.

“You’d be fucked if I’d ever had a weekday off from making dinner,” she said, shortly before asked for a drag on our reporters lit JPS Blue.

“My man is probably putting the Magnetic Island holiday fund through Big Red somewhere and my kids are probably cutting the end of a neighbour’s hose. I don’t care,”

“But the common denominator in all of their behaviours is that they’ll be hungry when they finally get back to the over-capitalised bogan bordello. So on the way home, I pulled up at the shops and got a prepackaged Greek salad and two kilos of frozen lasagne. Dinner is sorted.”

The Advocate reached out to one of Principal Matthews’ sons, but he was otherwise engaged.

He explained that he’d be happy to talk to us after he was done ripping cones under his friend’s grandma’s North Betoota Queenslander.

Brenda’s husband is currently under arrest from DUI and is due to be released before dinner.

Report: Drinking In Direct Sunlight Found To Increase Alcoholic Beverage Strength By Up To 50%

TEXT:

Australia’s peak scientific body has today confirmed what many believe to be true.

The CSIRO, a chronically-underfunded government money pit, released their findings today into whether drinking alcoholic beverages in direct sunlight makes them more potent.

And it makes for chilling reading.

Speaking to the media today in Canberra, a faceless spokesman from the Organisation said that all the evidence they’ve collected over the past few weeks all points to one thing.

“Yes,” he said.

“Drinking in direct sunlight all day makes the drinks you’re drinking much more powerful. We don’t really know why, but we paid two young ladies of similar size and piss fitness to strawpedo a bottle of cleanskin chardonnay at the same time,”

“However, one was in the heavily-airconditioned pokie room down at the Betoota Hotel and the other nice lady was sitting on a camping chair in the middle of the carpark where it was the best part of fifty in the shade.”

The scientist then explained that he didn’t really need to explain what happened next – but he would anyway.

“So the girl in the carpark said she felt like death and begged God for forgiveness an hour after inhaling the white wine,”

“While the polite double-xer in the pokie den said she felt like she could run through a brick wall. We had to physically restrain her to prevent her from actually trying,”

“Therefore, we concluded that drinking in the sun is way worse and it is only fun in moderation. It makes drinks, like, about 50% more powerful? That sounds about right. Did you know we invented wi-fi?”

The CSIRO’s report can be found in full on their website.

Pub Chef Bares His Soul With New Pepper Grinder Tattoo

TEXT:

Whether he’s burning steaks or shingling cheddar over a chicken parmigiana, it’s safe to say Dale Poing’s passion lies within the culinary arts.

He returns to work often without washing his hands, rarely acknowledging anybody on the pass with more than a grunt.

There’s pub chefs – and then there’s Dale.

The 28-year-old used to work at the local Merivale hotel in town, The Dickless Parrot on Vulture Road in Betoota Heights, but he said he didn’t go to chef school to learn what ‘gruyere’ is.

So now he works at the South Betoota RSL where he’s free to abuse people and put his entire paycheck down Pelican Pete’s gullet.

However, the spritely Virgo spoke exclusively to The Advocate this morning about his craft and how he’s recently shown a commitment to his job.

“Look at this, you pencilneck fuckboy,” he said to our reporter.

Poing rolled up his sleeve and unpeeled the protective Glad Wrap cover.

“This is called a pepper grinder. We in the industry use it to transform pepper from it’s original seeded form to a fine (or course) powder that adds spice to dishes,”

“I got it because I’m a chef and this is what I do. I make food and then I go home. There’s a lot of drinking and watching European sports. I don’t even like soccer, it’s for wallys. But it’s the only thing on after my shift so I go for Liverpool. You’ll never walk by yourself!”

Our reporter declined Poing’s offer of a free pint of postmix pub squash and left.

Confused Boomer Attempts To Move Against The Flow Of Passengers Disembarking Plane

TEXT:

A gibbering old fuck was seen attempting to move against the flow of disembarking passengers today shortly after the 3:20 pm Qantas service to town landed.

While some immediately and needlessly stood as the plane pulled up at the ramp, Graeme Ponk was determined to be different.

The 68-year-old didn’t remain seated, he didn’t try and stand up in the race to be first off the plane.

He did something much, much more unique.

Speaking exclusively to The Advocate this afternoon, fellow passenger Emily Spearman detailed what the confused, terrified Baby Boomer did next.

“This old bloke started walked toward the back of the plane, even though there weren’t any back steps,” she said.

“He was moaning about being unable to find his bag or something. It was in the overhead bins opposite his seat. We could all see it. Fuck me dead, don’t ever let me get that old and afraid.”

“Come to my house on my 60th birthday and shoot me through the brain like at the end of The Departed or something. That looks like hell. You could see everyone on the plane looking at Graeme with absolute disgust.”

Mercifully, an errant stewardess appeared to corral the intrepid sexagenarian into going back with the flow.

He helped Graeme find his carry-on luggage and told him which carousel to find his checked bags – to which Graeme asked:

“What on Earth is a carousel and why does it have my bags!”

Parent Films School Play Someone Will Eventually Be Held Captive With

TEXT:

Eleanor Mitchell (42) felt very proud as she watched her daughter perform in a school play which she filmed in its entirety and will eventually hold someone hostage with.

The play in question featured Mitchell’s daughter Lillian (10) acting as a giraffe who was friends with a tiger and polar bear, despite the fact that in real life these animals live in completely different parts of the world and would kill each other if they ever met.

Biological and geographical blunders aside, Eleanor Mitchell found the 15-minute ordeal delightful and is likely planning to show the full video to some poor soul in the near future.

“Had to delete all my podcasts to make room for it,” stated Mitchell as she watched the shaky video of her daughter onstage with her back to the audience.

“Here’s her line, I’ll turn it up!”

At present, Mitchell plans on showing the video to all of her family members who couldn’t make it to her daughter’s play.

“I can’t just post it on Facebook because it has other people’s kids in it. I’ll have to sit with them and show them the whole thing, rewinding if they miss anything and pausing to explain anything that might have gone over their heads.”

Mitchell states she is very proud of her recording, which according to her is just like being there except for the grainy appearance, limited field of vision and unbalanced audio which means the child actors can hardly be heard while every sniff from the audience is amplified.

Account Exec Feeling Threatened After Intern Forms Bond With Her Work BFF

TEXT:

Local girl Jasmine Richards has just seen Cayley Stephens go down for a coffee with the intern. Which is weird, because usually going to get coffee in the morning is hers and Cayley’s thing.

The account exec and Cayley are what is commonly known as ‘work BFFs’, a close relationship two women form in their place of work. Characteristics of this bond are that the two go everywhere together, have lame personal jokes and are often quite exclusive.

Up until now, Jasmine has been feeling very secure in her BFF status with Cayley, however ever since that intern started, Jasmine has been feeling threatened – how dare she be BFF’s with her BFF?

“Omg, right? Like who even is this intern?” Jasmine said to our reporter.

“Cayley and I go downstairs and get coffees together but now she’s going with the intern! Wtf is that?”

When asked why she has taken a defensive approach as opposed to trying to be friends with the intern and most likely finding similarities with her, Jasmine gave a rather juvenile response.

“Because she’s my best friend, I was here first, the intern can go find her own friend”

At this point it became clear that Jasmine was just one of those girls, the highly possessive, immature types that mentally hasn’t left high school yet.

Despite Jasmines aversion to the intern, reports from the office indicate that she’s actually a really nice girl and pretty good at her job – which is likely why Jasmine is so threatened by her.

Huge Sigh Of Relief After Driver Successfully Executes Reverse Park In Front Of Cafe

TEXT:

Local woman Ava Morrison has just successfully executed a reverse park of medium difficulty outside a busy French Quarter café.

Reports from the café say that Ava’s sigh of relief could be heard over the general café hum and even the coffee machine.

Prior to Ava’s arrival, customers at the busy café had the joy of watching a previous driver try and fail to park in the spot, as one woman explains.

“Oh, it was fantastic! They must have had at least 4 goes at getting in there”

“Then they gave up and drove away”

“That’s the best, seeing them give up and drive away with their tail between their legs”

It’s this exact attitude that warranted Ava’s loud and lengthy sigh as she turned off the ignition.

It’s believed that Ava, who waited until she was 25 to get her L plates, had the added stress of two male friends in the car, one of whom she was hoping to make more than a friend.

“Oh my god. I’m so happy I nailed that park”

“I probably would have just got out and left it if I didn’t”

“I don’t need that stress, especially when I’m trying to impress Tiago”

It’s hard work catching the eye of a Portuguese stud, but Ava says her expert parking skills may have given her the upper hand she needed to begin her courting phase with Tiago.

Approximately 6 months ago Jess’s husband filed for a divorce after he fell in ‘love’ with a fellow police officer. It’s believed that the woman he chose over Jess seduced her ex-husband by wearing provocative clothing and laughing obnoxiously loudly at his jokes that weren’t even funny.

“Maybe that’s what I should be doing in the office? [Haha]” Jess laughed awkwardly.

While it’s great that Jess is putting on a brave face, as one colleague explains, the constant jokes about it are just starting to make things awkward.

“I don’t know whether to laugh or console her, do I just ignore that she’s dropped her divorce into the conversation?”

“It’s getting so awkward now.”

“The other day she was milling around the bin, making a bit of a fuss, you know just waiting for someone to ask her what’s wrong.”

“So, I asked her, and she goes ‘oh yeah everything’s fine, if fine means that my husband left me for another woman’ like wtf?”

“How am I meant to respond to that?”

Drunk Mate Entering Mute Phase

Emily Smales has just offered her last piece of incoherent speech to her drunken girls chat at a Betoota pub this evening.

It’s been confirmed that Smales has officially hung up her talking boots and is entering the drunken mute phase of the evening, where she removes herself mentally, just leaving her smiling, captainless body at the table as a decoration.

Friends of Smales have said that this is a common occurrence for the young party animal, not wanting to miss out yet not knowing her own limits.

“Yeah, shje does thhiss all ther time” slurred one of her marginally more coherent friends.

“We’ll tjake her home with us whan whe gao”

It’s not yet known exactly when that will be, but our reporter at the scene has been able to stay quite close to the developing story, stating that Smales has made eye contact with a number of her friends but not yet said anything.

In absence of being able to interview Smales, The Advocate reached out to a 24-hour alcohol specialist who was able to offer some insight into what exactly is going through the drunken girl’s mind.

“She’s likely thinking to herself that she’s got everything under control and that she’s not that drunk” said Dr. Barron.

“Quite often selective mutes think they’re still regularly participating in conversation, so in her mind everything is normal.”

“Alternatively, she’s geeing herself up to muster the strength to get to a cab and go home.”

Whatever is going on in her pissed little brain, our reporter is keeping a close eye on Smales to make sure she gets into a cab safely.

“Today is a day for people to show their support for some of their favourite homegrown bands,” Tom told The Advocate via mobile phone this afternoon.

“I wanted to wear my Jebbediah t-shirt but I guess I just got disgtracted. I forgot what day today was. So here I am, on Triple J’s second most sacred day, wearing a band t-shirt,”

Girl Feeling Cheated After Jury Duty Turns Out To Be For Some Lame White-Collar Shit

Kate Swan may be the only person ever to get excited about being called up for jury duty.

In bucking the Australian trend, she hasn’t even attempted to make up an excuse to get out of it.

However, Kate’s excitement was shattered into a thousand tiny pieces after the case she has been assigned to turned out to be some bullshit white-collar crime and not the gritty sex or underworld crimes she’d hoped for.

“I’m so off it! This is nothing like Law and Order.”

“Or legally blonde!”

“Or Suits.”

“This is the shittest thing ever, and now I’m stuck here,” she moaned.

Kate’s boredom and disappointment are definitely justified, as the case she’s been assigned is a run of the mill assault defamation between two rich cousins in a local family.

Kate couldn’t go into detail about what she had heard as a juror so far but explained that she wasn’t having fun.

“There are just so many things I don’t understand about this case.”

“They’re both guilty in my eyes, I just want this to end.”

These cases typically draw out due to the stubbornness and idiocy of both parties, and as Kate is only in the first recess of the first day, it’s looking like it will be a long week.

Feeling isolated from the small rural property he has spent a few months in total on since he started high school, Ben Hogan made a heartfelt purchase today.

The 25-year-old Markets Analyst in Betoota’s Old City District decided to purchase a rain gauge online in order to keep an eye on ‘how many mils we got overnight.’

ScoMo Vomits After Trying Traditional Tradie-Bloke Breakfast Of Choccie Milk And A Dart

This morning in Singapore, the Prime Minister took his PR rebrand to the next level by taking to social media to enjoy a traditional tradesman’s breakfast in his hotel room.

However, it’s reportedly backfired after Scott Morrison (known locally by his stage name ScoMo) ran from the room to projectile vomit up the side of the vanity before collapsing beside the porcelain.

Workers groups, who said the PM’s Facebook Live Stream was largely offensive to their culture and society, took the opportunity to slam Scott this morning in the wake of the stunt.

Agent Punished For Giving Bond Back To Tenant Despite Evidence Living Room Had Been Lived In

TEXT:

A French Quarter leasing agent told The Advocate this afternoon that he’s being reprimanded for releasing a bond in full back to a tenant this week – despite their being evidence to suggest the property’s living room had been lived in at some point during the lease.

Oscar Lipseen, of HG Stock and Realty, said the property on Rue de Nique ta Mère was cleaned and left in an appropriate condition at the conclusion of the lease, so he released the full bond back to the former tenant.

However, the 27-year-old explained to our reporter that upon his return to the estate agency’s offices, he was almost immediately called to his supervising manager’s cubicle.

“I was told that I hadn’t performed my duties to an acceptable level,” he said.

“My boss said we are never to release a full bond back to a tenant unless we know them or they’re a friend of a friend. The senior partner of the office has a cleaning company, too. Company policy dictates that every single property must be cleaned before it’s returned to the market,”

“Even if it’s already clean enough. They exclusively use the partner’s cleaning company. Anyway, I said I didn’t know the procedure and my boss accepted that but gave me a stern warning not to do it again.”

As for punishment, Lipseen says he has to spend another year working the leasing desk before he’s allowed to start selling houses and making a livable wage.

However, the director of HG Stock and Realty has hit back at his ‘disposable piece of shit’ in his ‘disposable double-breasted Tarocash three-piece’ by saying there was evidence that suggested the house was far from clean when he got the keys back.

“There was a large amount of evidence to suggest that the living room had been used for living,” said director Brett Doink.

“The carpets were trodden down a bit. There were a few scuff marks on the wall. It looked like that fucking tent city in Calais! And then when I found out Oscar, that dumb fuck, released the full bond back to them without having the boss’ cleaning company give it the once over, I almost had a stroke!”

“He’ll learn his lesson! Nobody gets their full bond back on my watch!”

Our reporter nodded.

The Advocate has reached out to Janine fucking Willmott for comment but has yet to receive a reply – due to the time difference between Betoota and Antigua.

Office Intellect Leaves Book On Desk In Hopes Of You Noticing It

TEXT:

Ned Oakburn has today picked up his copy of George Orwell’s 1984 and sat it strategically atop his desk for everyone in the office to see.

This comes despite his empty backpack sitting right beside him.

It’s believed that Ned has done this in hopes of garnering some extra attention from colleagues passing by his desk, as one cluey co-worker explained to the Advocate earlier.

“Yeah, he does it all the time. He puts out whatever book he’s reading so people see it.”

“It was some book on psychology the other day, he’s a fricken human resources manager for god’s sake.”

“He reckons he’s an intellect, but he’s just a twat,” said the colleague who wished to remain anonymous.

The Advocate reluctantly reached out to Ned to see why he does this every day, instead of storing it in a bag the same way everyone else stores their personal possessions at work.

“Oh, I didn’t know I was doing it…”

“But if I was doing it, well I think it’s a nice conversation starter.”

“I’d love to talk to someone about how Orwell’s themes in 1984 actually translate to today’s society?“ he asked.

At this point, our reporters told him they had another job to do.

Surf School’s Final Lesson Teaches Students How To Fight A Local After Repeatedly Dropping In On Them

TEXT:

“If you can, try and grab a handful of hair. That way you can free up your other hand to punch the bloke across the chin. Hopefully rendering them unconscious,” he said.

“Fighting in the surf is very difficult, but not impossible. With enough focus and dedication, anybody can do it. Even you.”

The final pep talk Betoota Ponds surfing coach, Adam Rutland, gives his students isn’t one that inspires confidence, it’s designed to help them overcome the first big hurdle that surfing a new break.

The locals.

The Lake Betoota Surfing Complex opened late last year and was almost immediately claimed by a local surfing gang.

While it attracts a number of tourists each year, police and council have had to explain time and time again that the artificial wave generator belongs to everyone – not just ‘the locals’.

The complex has been the scene of surf-related violence in the past and students often feel the brunt of it.

“Which is why I teach them how to fight while sitting on a surfboard,” says Rutland.

Adam took time out of his busy afternoon of smoking bongs and complaining about the onshore breezes today to speak to The Advocate about his controversial surf school.

“Getting bashed by the locals for repeatedly dropping in on them is a rite of passage for every new surfer. I want my students to have the best chance of winning,”

“So I give them a few pointers.”

Council To Trial ‘Yuppie Cull’ In Bid To Save Fledgling Local Tourist Attraction

TEXT:

The thousands of young professionals that have recently moved into our town’s French Quarter have been put on notice today by the Shire Council after a report into the damage they cause to the local tourism industry has prompted a plan to cull them.

From next week, any ‘yuppie’ that is caught within the vicinity of the struggling Betoota Museum Of Technology runs the risk of being shot through the brain by a trained marksman.

The report, which found that these city workers with their high disposable incomes and a high sense of self-worth, have heavily gentrified the area and destroyed the nighttime tourism economy that once thrived in the French Quarter.

“Enough,” said Mayor Keith Carton today at a press conference on the corner of Rue de Branlette and Rue Putain.

“People aren’t coming to the French Quarter anymore. Tourists are cancelling bookings. The impact that these fucking yuppies are having on the Betoota Museum of Technology is also extremely profound. It’s on the verge of collapse. There’s talk of it moving out to Betoota Ponds!”

“So we are taking measures to protect the local tourism industry here in the French Quarter by culling the biggest yuppies in the area.”

However, the controversial move to murder innocent civilians without warning with a high-powered rifle has been met with criticism from justice groups.

But one local is in support of the measures.

Despite having barely enough cognitive function to select an appropriate rock out of a pile to throw at a passing bus, Dennis Capallerbar said he moved to the French Quarter to be closer to his place of employment.

The 28-year-old works full time at the Betoota Museum of Technology as a ticket stamper. He rose to local fame in 2011 for downing a schooner of Windex in a dare that ultimately cost him the ability to recognise faces.

Dennis spoke to our reporter out the front of the Museum a short time ago.

“The so-called ‘research’ the shire council has done is just typical Betoota Grove thinking,” he said, in his outdoor voice while inside.

“There rich toffs think they know what it’s like but they don’t. They don’t listen. These yuppie attacks on the French Quater have destroyed the tourism industry!”

Young Dennis then became so worked up, his brain began to misfire and he stopped speaking altogether.

But some members in the French Quarter Chamber of Commerce have lashed out at the plan, saying that these yuppies are a vital part of the area’s financial system and removing them in such a violent manner will have run-on effects long into the future.

However, as we were preparing to interview one yuppie from the Chamber of Commerce at Pont Jardin on Rue du Lapin, a trigger-happy marksman shot the young man in the throat and he quickly died then and there on the park bench in front of our reporter.

The sniper is set to be reprimanded for killing a yuppie a few days early.

Local Dad Eats Entire Apple Core As If It’s Wartime

TEXT:

What started as a normal day about the town now has a slight air of the obscure as local dad Wesley Moss (62) was seen eating a whole apple core as if it’s wartime.

After picking the fruit from his apple tree that literally everyone he has ever met knows about, Moss proceeded to walk from his home to the local township while munching the sweet fruit as if he were a naive child at the beginning of an 1800s coming of age tale.

At about 10:30 am, Moss was seen walking through the village eating the apple core in its entirety including stem, seeds and that weird little spiky bit at the bottom.

According to witnesses, Moss’s ration-era eating habits caused the bustling township to grind to a halt as shopkeepers pressed their faces against windows, cyclists lost control of their bikes and frightened children asked their parents what the strange man was doing.

“Morning,” Moss was quoted as saying to one passerby as if consuming the entire core of his apple was the most normal thing on Earth and not a sign of a crumbling society on the brink of self-destruction.

“Great day for it!”

Witness accounts state a large number of town’s population retreated to the town church once Moss had consumed the whole apple as if he had a curse that meant he could never be satisfied.

“I think he does it to intimidate people,” stated Moss’s eldest son Wendel.

“I once saw him open a beer bottle with his teeth and swallow the bottle cap. It was a twist top to for fuck’s sake.”

Speaking exclusively with The Advocate, Moss bit the top off a press microphone before running about with his arms by his sides yelling “feed me!”

Substitute Teacher Gifts Ethnic Student Nickname For Life During Botched Roll Call

TEXT:

Substitute teacher Mr Ticehurst became another failing of the education system this week, gifting year 9 student Marek Majchrowski with a nickname for life during a botched roll call.

A first generation Australian, Majchrowski (pronounced Mik-roff-ski) is used to people having trouble pronouncing his Polish surname but was unprepared for the absolutely appalling display of roll call from Mr Ticehurst and the lingering effects it would have on his life.

“Mark – sorry Marek. Marek Maj…Maji?” stuttered the full-time substitute.

Majchrowski’s disgruntled assertions of attendance were drowned out by the growing murmur of laughter which only increased when class power-broker Dominic French cried out “Aw g’day Maji!” and lead the class in a roaring chant of the new nickname.

“Maji! Maji! Maji!”

Witnesses state substitute teacher Mr Ticehurst did little to control the class during this chant, offering instead a weak smile to suggest that this was a funny misunderstanding and not a costly mistake that would follow young Marek to his grave.

Expert estimate the new nickname is here to stay after Majchrowski asked that his friends stop calling him by his new moniker.

“The worst thing he could do is ask for them to stop calling him that,” remarked bullying expert Edwin “Balls Head” Ball.

“Trust me.”

Following the initial incident, it has been reported the new nickname has given birth to other titles such as ‘Noodle Boy’ and ‘2-Minute Maj’ a reference to the producers of 2-Minute Noodles, Maggi.

Anti-Horse Racing Activist Waits Until Coast Is Clear Before Making Move On Canapés In Office

TEXT:

Georgia Ainsley finally found the right time to strike at the office spread a short time ago.

The #FuckTheCup and #NupToTheCup activist has been particular active on her social media over the last few days, alerting all of her like minded friends that she is anti so many things that today stands for.

However, despite being stridently opposed to the concept of horse racing and gambling, Ainsley doesn’t mind a nice little bight to eat and a cold glass of champagne.

Which has left her in an uncomfortable position today, with all of her colleagues enjoying the excuse to have a couple drinks, some pleasant canapés and time off work thanks to the race that stops the nation.

Ainsley explained that she had to be very disciplined and patient, knowing that the right time to raid the spread would come.

“I mean I’ve made a point of telling everyone that the Melbourne Cup is actually fucked, so I can’t be seen to be enjoying some of the benefits that come from today,” Ainsley said.

Ainsley explained that she is saying ‘Nup to The Cup,’ but yes to a free spread and time off work.

“So I had just been waiting until everyone was a little bit tipsy and distracted by a race jumping.”

“Then I swooped in and grabbed a plate with Steve, who is also from the French Quarter and has been similar active in swaying public perception, and we stacked up some goodies and pinched some champas (sic).”

“I don’t think anyone saw us,” she laughed.

“If an activist crumbles in real life and social media doesn’t document it, did it really happen?”

“You cheap son-of-a-bitch, Graeme! I’d rather backflip into an empty pool than fly Tiger with you again!”

HR Forced To Step In After Numerous Complaints About The State Of Colleague’s Desktop

TEXT:

It’s been a real case of the Mondays for some local Human Resources staff members today, being forced to tackle an internal complaint head on this morning.

This busy start to the week for the HR team of two down at a firm in Betoota’s Old City District follows complaints levelled against an employee with a ‘disgusting laptop.’

The Advocate has been informed that the employee in question’s laptop, has a laptop with an “incredibly cluttered desktop” and has been a source of grievance for some time in the office.

“It’s fucking appaling,” said one anonymous complainant.

“It makes me sick every time I see it. For someone who seems to have their life in order, that desktop is cooked. How do you function like that?”

One HR staff member who was frustrated about having to actually do something told us that they just couldn’t leave the issue any longer.

“Yeah we spoke to the person at the centre of the complaint and just told him he’s gotta spend some time cleaning that thing up,” the HR team member said toying at some leftovers from the night before.

“Halfway through our pretty informal chat, the staff member in question opened up his phone to check something and we saw something else pretty disturbing.”

“341 unread text messages, and 2,000 unread emails just sitting there.”

“We are working out whether we will need to be escalating that, because if that was to get out imagine the anguish that would be caused around the office.”

Man Emerges From Racetrack Portaloo A Hero After Beating Personal Best Piss Flap Drop Count

TEXT:

The Betoota Gold Cup was the scene of many dramatic victories and losses this weekend – but none more so than Jack Rivers’ win he had alone in a trackside portaloo.

Speaking candidly to our reporter this morning through the flyscreen door of his rendered brick Betoota Heights display home, the 29-year-old explained that he’d had nine stubbies of beer before breaking the seal.

Which, he says, his more than usual.

So with his well-worn iPhone 5, he set out to the row of portaloos to see if he had enough body juice to break his personal best portaloo piss flap drop record.

“I did 17 flap drops at the Polo about four years ago,” he said.

Rivers is home today sick from work with the Toohey’s Flu, as he calls it.

“And that was after breaking the seal after six beers. So the first thing I did was get my phone out to film the record attempt.”

The part-time music student at South Betoota Polytechnic College told his WhatsApp group that he was about to go for 18 piss flap drops just minutes before the attempt.

With the best wishes of his very own digital men’s shed, Rivers walked into that portaloo a man – and emerged a hero.

“I did 22. That’s like two and a bit litres of urine. Honestly. 22 regulation flap drops. I started having an out of body experience at about 16. It felt like I had a fucking netball or something trapped in me that had a slow puncture in it,”

“I felt the pressure on my belt start to decrease. When it was all over, I felt fantastic. Like you could hitch a chisel plough to the back of my belt and watch me rip up a thousand acres with my two legs. Invincible.”

The video, which is about 3 minutes in length, shows the hero’s ample penis a number of times during the attempt as to verify that it wasn’t coming out of a water bottle or something to that effect.

However, due to that fact, The Advocate has chosen not to share it publically.

If you’d like to see the record-breaking video, please come down to The Advocate‘s offices in the Old City District and we’ll get someone to put it up on the big screen for you.

Golf Cart Undermines Any Benefits Of Actually Playing Golf

TEXT:

‘Proud gold wife’ mug recipient Lorna Davies (65) was happy to hear her husband was spending more time outdoors, until earlier this week when she discovered he was using a golf cart, undermining any of the health benefits he would have received from actually playing golf.

Under the assumption that her overweight partner of forty years Graham Davies (68) was fine with actually walking during a pleasant day on the green, Lorna discovered a receipt for golf cart hire in her husbands pants when she was about to treat them for grass stains.

“Oh would you believe it?” exclaimed Davies.

“How did that ratbag manage to get these stains then?”

According to Davies, she confronted her husband on the day of the discovery when he returned from the club after what he stated was an afternoon on the front nine and one or two light beers.

When confronted, Graham tried to explain to his wife that while he is very motivated to beat his friends in a competition to see who can best swing a thin metal club to knock a ball into a cup in the ground, he simply cannot be fucked walking.

“I won by the way in case you cared?”

When Lorna looked into Graham’s story she later learnt he had not won but tied with another player and hours later noted his nose looked sunburnt, casting doubt on his assurances that he had worn sunscreen.

“Kids Have Ridiculous Names These Days,” Says Bruce

TEXT:

As a slow news week draws to the end, publishers everywhere scramble to engage their online audience with a story about the weird names people are giving their children these days using quotes from an agreeable man named Bruce.

According to Bruce, names have gone too far these days and new parents need to rein it in when it comes to the stylistic spelling choices and pick something a bit more monosyllabic and old fashioned like his parents did.

“Do you know how stupid some of these names are?” asked a man whose name sounds like a contagious skin condition.

“I heard the name Indigo for a girl. That’s not a name and if it is, it’s a boys name surely!”

In order to further increase his outrage, we provided Bruce with a list of popular baby names which included the names of characters from the popular TV show Game of Thrones, a show that no one called Bruce has ever watched.

“How do you say this one? Carl-lis-ee? Why would you spell it that way, that’s just plain stupid, you just know that kid is going to have a double-barrel last name don’t you?”

Bruce is referring the popular Game of Thrones character who leads large armies to conquest in a show where a character called Bruce is would probably just be some peasant who dies while taking a shit.

Boomer Who Supported Joining The US In 4 Pointless Wars Condemns Americanisation Of Halloween

TEXT:

Albert Jensen has had just about enough of the Halloween rubbish this week.

The 65-year-old retired accountant from Betoota Grove hit out at the growing celebration of the American holiday of Halloween.

Jensen explained that he is fed up with all of this nonsense about a day we shouldn’t even be celebrating over here.

“The fact that I’m even here talking to you about it is a bloody joke,” he said.

“The deterioration of Australian culture is disgraceful,” explained the resident of a nation who tried it’s hardest for a couple of hundred years to erase roughly 40,000 years of the country’s culture/s.

“All kids do is watch American TV shows, play American games, and try and speak like Americans.”

Jensen then told The Advocate that he only supported following into America into four pointless wars because of regional and global stability.

“It was absolutely necessary that we sent our young men and women overseas to risk their lives fighting in conflicts that really had nothing whatsoever to do with us,” Jensen said.

“But we shouldn’t be following their lead blindly in regards to a random holiday that affects me in no way at all.”

Jensen’s wife Beryl told us that only one group of foolish kids knocked in the door.

“That was still enough to send Albert over the edge though. He decided to lecture some little girls just trying to get out of the house and say hello to their neighbours about the problems with celebrating the Americanised version of Halloween,” she said.

“Hopefully he’s going to calm down about it for a while now.”

Gen X Graphic Designer Renovates Terrace House Car Port For His Prized Saab

Gillion Andersen has finally shaken his builder’s hand today and put the cherry on top of his new reno.

The 52-year-old father of 2 smiled at his builder’s handiwork after the new carport he wanted to protect one of his most prized assets, reached completion today.

The Graphic Designer from Betoota’s French Quarter decided to undertake the ‘stressful’ and ‘onerous’ task of redoing his carport as a treat to his beloved Saab.

“I love her,” he laughed motioning to the 2000 model car.

“I also love my wife,” he chortled, flicking some European brand cigarette onto his driveway.

Like many Gen Xer’s around the country, Andersen explained that the Saab brand has always had a special place in his heart.

“They are beautiful in their own right. An ‘anti-brand’ brand,” he explained.

“The Swedish automobile perfectly says fuck conformity, and fuck the system that has benefited us so well you know.”

“So that’s why I needed to protect my baby,” he said referring to the car with an inexplicably placed ignition and an engine that would be better suited to a motorised scooter.

“Lord knows what I’ll do if I have to get another car,” he said referring to the fact that Saab has been defunct for a few years now.

Andersen then told The Advocate that he isn’t like every other Gen X who loves the ‘left of centre brand.’

“Did you see the way my name was a spelt,” he said.

“Not your typical ‘Anderson.’ I mean my family’s been in the country for 3 generations, but there is a bit of Scandi blood running through my veins.”

“Geez they’ve got it right over there,” he said before launching into a lecture about the ways in which Scandinavian country’s are miles ahead of us.

Arts Graduate Feeling A Little More Motivated After At Least Getting Auto-Reply To Job Application

After a few long months of fretting about her future, things are looking up for Kristen Sullivan.

Toiling away through online application after application, answering needless questions about herself that are already in her resume, Sullivan was beginning to wonder if there was light at the end of the tunnel.

So when she received an automatic group email from someone called Sophie, or Ellie, letting her know that she hadn’t made it through the interview round of the application, she realised, that the dream job may be out there after all.

Sullivan explained that although the auto-reply message only referred to her as “Dear Applicant” a wave of renewed optimism has washed over her body.

“I mean, it’s a shame that they couldn’t even be bothered to address me by name considering I spent 2 hours applying for a generic job as a Comms person at some corrupt regional fuck hole of a council, but hey it’s something,” Sullivan said.

“This is exactly what I need to spur me on to keep applying for a raft of jobs I’m aptly qualified for but probably won’t get for a variety of reasons.”

Sullivan explained that when she attended all the uni and career days, no one told her about how hard it is to get a job.

“These fucking uni’s should be sent to the ACCC. ‘Oh we have a 95% employment rate for journalism,’ they all tell you,” she said.

“Yeah and 10% of those people with a job are actually journalists. They rest of us are causal employees in hospitality and retail. I shoulda done teaching or something.”

Local Nurse Sleeps Easy Knowing She’s Paid More Tax Than Qantas And News Corp This Year

TEXT:

A deep sense of pride washed over Nicole Grayling last night as she finally got into bed after a double shift at Betoota Base Hospital.

As her spine decompressed and her ankles cracked back into their natural positions, she drifted off to sleep knowing that she proudly paid more tax this year than some of Australia’s largest companies.

News, Qantas, Glencore, Shell and other enormous multinationals are set to pay no tax in Australia this year – all the while benefiting by destroying the environment and using our nation’s infrastructure.

“But that doesn’t matter,” laughed the bubbly and approachable Nicole.

Speaking to The Advocate this morning, Grayling said she feels fantastic.

“I sleep easy at night knowing that I’m doing my bit. Knowing that 18% of my $64 000 salary is going to fund national infrastructure projects like Nauru and other awesome programmes that torture children helps me sleep like a log every night! All the while the big end of town doesn’t pay anything!”

“That’s life, I guess?”

Nevertheless, yesterday was an especially trying day down at our town’s largest medical facility.

The 24-year-old was assaulted by an out-of-control drug user, although her minor injuries felt better after the hospital’s security guard gave the man’s brain a full factory reset with his baton.

Nicole had to consul a young boy with double tibia fractures that came after the 6-year-old jumped off the roof of the family home in a double-dare gone wrong.

A rude and largely unpopular senior man shit his bed twice in protest of the hospital food.

“Needless to say,” she said.

“Yesterday was a bit of a bitch. I was supposed to go home at 6 but they were understaffed out the ying-yang! So I was like, ‘fuck my fucking life, I want to fucking die,’ and then punched in for another shift!”

“Oh well. At least it’ll help me pay off my HECS quicker and go to lowering our national debt. Who knows, maybe some of my tax dollars will help pay one of Christopher Pyne’s research junkets to Spain to buy some more second-rate el cheapo destroyers?”

“Whatever it is, I’m proud of it. It helps me sleep better at night – working 16 hours on my feet.”

Man Heroically Pays For Lunch By Saying He Needs The Points

A local man has wowed some half cut mates today over a long lunch.

The 28-year-old commercial leasing agent from Betoota’s Heights district was enjoying the company of a couple of friends down at an Old City District restaurant when the conversation briefly turned to what should be done about the bill.

Harley Thomas, who for some reason decided to pretend like his mates hadn’t adhered to the code of someone just informally picking up the bill when they felt like it was their turn and paying for the group meal, decided to make a statement.

Despite the fact that he hadn’t paid for lunch for the last few outings, Thomas decided to announce to the group that he would get lunch today because he needed the points.

“Don’t worry fellas, Daddy Thomas will pick up the bill for you dawgs,” he said infuriatingly.

After ever looked at him nonchalantly, he decided to qualify his kindness.

‘“I need the points anyway,” he laughed, motioning to his Velocity card.

“Not far off booking flights to Fiji with the points from this bad boy,” he said hopping out of his sit and walking to the counter.

One of his friends Glenn Hunt spoke to us about Thomas’ heroics just moments ago.

“Lol (sic). I’m pretty sure it was his turn to pay for lunch. He hasn’t bought one of our lunches for ages,” Hunt said.

Coupled with the casual of her workplace contract, it means any time off that doesn’t ultimately result in her death, would obviously end with her losing her job.

“Suppose I could just not go?” she laughed in resignation.

“But she’s put me in the bridal party, so I have to go. Maybe I should just get a credit card and let my credit score slip further and further down that alphabet of shame? At this point, I don’t even care,”

“I might call my Mum tonight and just have a good old-fashioned bitch about my life and how fucked everything is. She’ll agree with me and it’ll make me feel better,”

Suburb’s Gentrification Process Now Complete With The Arrival Of Dogs Wearing Raincoats

TEXT:

Our desert community is mourning the loss of another suburb to the horrors of gentrification this morning after a dog was spotted in Gawden Estate sporting a raincoat.

The one rough neighbourhood has been under attack in recent years from do-gooder city workers and the parent-subsidised South Betoota Polytechnic Students who were initially attracted by the cheaper rent but have now grown to claim the enclave as their own.

Just two short years ago, an argument down at the former Anvil & Heroin Hotel on Curllewis Street turning tragic when a young man was curb-stomped in front of his pregnant wife after suggesting Curtis Stone’s chicken casserole tasted like ‘Mark Taylor’s dot’.

But a wave of relief washed over him like a fully-clothed tourist stuck in a rip as soon as he got outside.

“How do you drive this fucking wookatook piece of shit?” yelled George Washbrook, a perennially angry and frustrated local baby boomer who has by the grace of God somehow avoided a serious cardiac episode in his life.

“I was trying to send a message to your sister and it fucking disappeared.”

He was huffing and shaking at this point.

However, in a cruel twist of fate, Nathan looked at the half-fucked Motorolla Razr and shrugged.

“I don’t know how to use those things either, Dad,” he said.

“Let me take a look, but.”

After a few minutes of dicking about, Nathan was able to find his way back to the message his father was attempting to compose.

Confiding in our reporter, Nathan said the message was not to his sister but to his receptionist.

“Why do bad things happen to good people?” he asked The Advocate while our reporter was buying him cigarettes at Sully’s Newsagency in South Betoota.

Our reporter shrugged and he didn’t know – but assured the Year 7 student at The Whooton School that what goes around, ultimately comes around.

Local Apprentice Shocks Friends And Opts Against Spending 80% Of His Wage On A New Ute

TEXT:

Those who know Kayden Gardiner, were over the moon when the young man landed himself a carpentry apprenticeship this month.

They were all happy he was able to pursue a trade he had been keen on since primary school.

However, most of his friends and family knew this would automatically mean he lived off pittance, with the majority of his meagre apprentice wage going towards a high-interest car loan.

So that’s why everyone was genuinely shocked, and pleasantly surprised when the 17-year-old from Betoota Heights decided against buying a brand spanking new set of wheels.

Instead, the young man has decided to live as well as possible and maybe save for a trip overseas.

Gardiner’s mate Jim Phelps told The Advocate today that he was genuinely shocked when the young man said he might not splurge on an overpriced fuel guzzler.

“I just assumed it was a formality,” Phelps said to us.

“It’s just what young blokes who don’t know how to manage their finances do when they get their first few pay cheques. A right of passage really isn’t.”

Phelps explained that he wasn’t sure what the other boys on site will think about the decision.

“I mean obviously he will get tagged in memes featuring dildos and men in leather arseless chaps etc, but hopefully they don’t give him too much shit.”

Local Woman Graces Newsfeed With What Looks Like Her Scariest Halloween Costume Yet

TEXT:

Sasha Hillyard has given her followers on social media a fright this afternoon.

The 28-year-old school teacher from the Betoota’s Heights District did so by revealing what could be her spookiest Halloween costume yet.

With the American holiday that has become increasingly popular over here only a week away, and many adult celebrations taking place over the weekend, Hillyard has made a shock reveal.

‘Getting ready for Halloween,’ she posted on Instagram and Facebook with a scary looking facemask.

One of her friends and followers Phil Phelps told us that he was immediately given chills the moment he saw it.

“Holy fuck. That’s some like Saw level shit. She looks like she is going to chop someone’s fingers off in a basement,” Phelps said.

“Serious kudos to her, that’s an awesome effort. I can’t wait to see the rest of her outfit on the weekend!”

We contacted Hillyard for the comment on her outfit that had shocked plenty more of her friends but she seemed confused by our reporter’s lines of questioning.

“What are you talking about?” she asked.

“My outfit isn’t even that scary at all. I’m just wearing the same stuff as last year.”

When our reporter explained that people were scared of the mask that she was planning to wear, she shut the door and told him that she had no idea what he was on about.

Franking Credits Debate Now Distant Memory As Boomers Channel Rage Into Aussies Celebrating Halloween

TEXT:

If you had asked Beryl and Phil Bloomfield a few months ago about franking credits scrapped, it would have sent them into a white rage.

The retirees who reside in Betoota Grove, were a seething mass of anger for months on end, as the debate around franking credits raged across the town and the country.

However, in an incredible turn of events, and a testament to the ever-changing news cycle, the grandparents have turned their scathing social media comments onto a new topic.

Halloween.

Notably, the celebration of the American holiday in towns and cities across Australia.

The couple took to Facebook yesterday with their shared account to explain to their 98 friends just why Halloween getting a run over here is ridiculous.

They also took the time to talk to The Advocate today about the issue.

“Excuse me? Where are we right now?” Beryl asked us.

After telling her we were in Betoota she followed up with.

“That’s right. Betoota. Betoota, Australia! Not Alabama, or Arkansas or Arizona State,” she said.

“So why the bloody hell are we celebrating an American holiday here,” she asked rhetorically.

At this point, Phil chimed in.

“No idea why. We have spent a 100 years trying to build this country’s identity,” he said completely canvasing over millennia of history and culture in one sentence.

“And everyone wants to Americanize the way we live. it’s a disgrace. I haven’t been this fired up about something since the PC brigade forced us to pay for plastic bags.”

“It’s pronounced Zed, not Zee! We put jam on our sandwiches, not Jelly, and we celebrate Australia Day not Halloween.”

Beryl and Phil finished by telling The Advocate that they certainly wouldn’t be stocking up on treats ahead of whatever day the holiday fell on.

Local Mum Already Beginning To Stress Over Christmas Lunch

“It’s just that your fucking aunt and uncle eat so much, I don’t know how much to cook,” she said.

“That and they’ll probably be Grant Hackett wheelchair drunk by the time the turkey comes out of the oven and they won’t even taste it! God! Why does it always feel like it’s my turn to host Christmas! Fuck!”

Michael Roundtree didn’t have an answer, he just told his mother she was right and that she had every right to be stressed about Christmas lunch.

Even though he didn’t necessarily agree.

The Betoota Heights resident spoke to The Advocate this afternoon about the current mood his mother is in – all because of Christmas lunch.

“I long to be stressed about something so trivial,” he said.

“But she has a point but it’s also the 22nd of November. There’s like 60-odd days until the big dance. She could microwave the fucking turkey and I’d still eat it. Dad would still eat it, then start smoking at the table, ashing on his empty plate like some sort of Persian king,”

“Honestly, she’ll John Candy her big heart one day if she lets herself get this stressed about things like this.”

Our reporter spoke to Marcia Roundtree this afternoon about her planned Christmas lunch and the trials and tribulations that go into such an endeavour.

“You don’t and probably will never understand the responsibility,” she said coldly.

“In fact, I’m too stressed to even talk about it. Bonsoir, Errol.”

Coworker’s New Tattoo Has Really Lame Back Story

TEXT:

A local cleanskin has today found himself having to lie to his tattooed co-worker after the co-worker shoved a weeping chest in his face saying, ‘look at my new ink, isn’t it cool?’

Luckily for Mike Ropesly, the cleanskin, he was quick-witted and able to think on his feet, summoning a supportive response in 0.43 seconds.

“Oooh mate, that’s so cool! I love it. Does it have any significant meaning, or you just got it because you think it’s cool?”

For our readers, the tattoo is a romanticised image of a tribal dragon. There are some textual lines drawn seemingly at random around the image, it’s yet to be confirmed whether these lines are intentional or where the artist was checking to see if his gun was working.

“Oh, it’s definitely got meaning. I’ve been going through some shit and I feel like the dragon fighting St George. I feel like my spirit animal is a dragon, so dreaming about it was a sign. I got it over my heart because I’m dragonhearted.”

“It’s kind of a visual metaphor for how I wish my life truly was.”

“Ohhhh oh cool cool, cool. Cool.” said Mike the cleanskin.

“And what do the squiggly lines mean?”

“Oh, they’re how I wish straight lines were [haha]”

“Why be so straight? Why not be a squiggle? The world needs more squiggle.”

Mike informed the Advocate that his tattooed co-worker already has plans to add to his tattoo, he just has to wait for this one to stop weeping and itching.

Year 12 Student First Person In Family To Experience Stress

TEXT:

“You guys just don’t fucking understand!”

“I have got 3 exams in one week!”

“There’s no way I can study for all these exams at once!”

Those are the pathetic cries of current year 12 student, Danika Fernly. Danika, like many other year-12 students before her, is under the illusion that she is the first person to experience stress from the HSC exams.

“I need special consideration, or something!”

According to Danika’s mum, Beth, Danika has been carrying on a little bit too much.

“I’m just about sick of her complaining to be honest, I’ve got real stresses on my plate. Like being a single mother paying for my daughter to go through private school, while also paying off a mortgage. If she wants stress she should take a walk in my shoes for a day.”

“Bloody special consideration, life doesn’t give you special consideration!”

“The way the media, ABC in particular, pander to year 12 students shits me to tears. That’s why we’re pumping out a generation of wusses, because everyone is too scared to tell them to suck it up.”

While Beth may have let her frustrations clear to our reporter, the front she puts on for Danika is the complete opposite. To Danika’s face Beth is much like every other parent; telling their child that they are special, and the HSC is hard and if it’s too stressful just take a break – a two-faced-phenomena that is in fact just perpetuating the cycle of wussiness everyone is so sick and tired of.

Live Music Enthusiast Puts Concert Highlights On Instagram Story For Her Less Cool Followers

TEXT:

Last night at the Betoota Bowery Ballroom, a local live music enthusiast stood in awe as Taxiride played a smorgasbord of their classic hits – as well as their tasteful and experimental new stuff.

As Emma Hall bobbed her head and clicked her fingers to the beat, she paused and thought that the second emergence of the chorus is Creepin’ Up Slowly would be some prime content to throw up on her Instagram Story.

Speaking to The Advocate this morning with a sore head and the fleeting remnants of a K-hole, the 28-year-old youngish professional said she had a blast – and she wanted her ‘less-cool’ followers to know she was at a show.

“My friends and I smoked a joint before we went in. Classic Taxiride behaviour, they have the best fans,” she said.

“But I didn’t put that on my IG story! Just the gig! I’ve got so many friends who don’t do anything on the weekend. They put boring things like their partners, dogs, babies or them on a hike on their Insta stories,”

“Not me. I got so hammered last night, I did ketamine. Went to a kick on and yeah, this guy cut me a line and said, ‘go ham’, so I went ham. I went from having a good time to speaking Greek to myself in the back garden in like 30 seconds! Cool!”

A friend and avid follower of Emma’s social media activity also spoke to our reporter this morning.

Grace Lee freely admitted she didn’t do anything last night because she ‘doesn’t have a life’ and ‘felt tired’.

The lame Virgo went on to reiterate to our reporter that she did not, in fact, feel FOMO for not going to Taxiride last night.

“I don’t know why people do this, I reckon people just swipe left and go onto the next story,” she said.

“But yeah, last night. I didn’t do anything. My three friends were all away for doing something with family so I just watched MeatEater on Netflix and dreamed about buying a nice rifle and getting amongst nature,”

“I think I’ve got it in me to shoot, clean and butcher a deer. It seems like such a nice way to live. So primal. So, uh yeah. Not jealous of Taxiride.”

Man Not Willing To Engage In Fistfight With Complete Stranger In Public Labeled A Dropnuts

TEXT:

A local man is facing stinging criticism today after his attempts at trying to resolve conflict at a local train station yesterday.

The 33-year-old man named Chris Koslch, unlike many other men, doesn’t adhere to the oft-touted theorem of toxic masculinity.

So he didn’t attempt to resolve the conflict by threatening to knock the other bloke out and entering into a peacocking display until someone wins the bluff, or the two come to blows.

Instead, he simply tried to pretend the situation was not happening, staring awkwardly at some weird advertising banner on the other side of the tracks.

The situation occurred on the T3 line out to the ponds, when a local lad caught accountant Kolsch looking in his direction.

While many would think it somewhat reasonable that a young shirtless man blasting some gutter rap out of his phone drinking a long neck be the subject of a few looks from other commuters, the man at the centre of the scene yesterday certainly did not.

However, Brayden Smith, the 23-year-old shirtless Eshay who was the subject of some stray glances, was far from flattered and zeroed in on Kolsch.

”Something wrong with ya eyes cunts” barked the young Rockstar energy drink enthusiast.

“You wanna gee-oh?”

At which point Kolsch became visibly uncomfortable.

“I’ll do you right here in front of the grannies I don’t give a fuck you fat cunt” the eshay finally yelled at Kolsch realising the battle was won.

Thankfully the train rolled in and Kolsch scuttled up into a different carriage to shamefully pass the time until commute finished at the Ponds.

Man Goes Back To Buying Vegetable Oil Instead Of Fancy Olive Variety After Girlfriend Leaves Him

TEXT:

As the gentle guitar strums in the intro to Tom Petty’s 1991 classic, Learning to Fly, guide Glenn Jordan down the supermarket aisles this afternoon, it’s clear to him that he needs to do some learning of his own.

Speaking exclusively to The Advocate today, the 34-year-old said he needs to learn how to love himself again – after his life partner of seven years, Daphne O’Peachman, walked out on him earlier this month for someone much more successful and better looking than he is.

But, he said, at the moment his priorities are elsewhere.

This afternoon in Coles South Betoota, he’s trying to see the silver lining in the little things.

Our reporter joined him for a few laps around the cold produce and pasta sections, stopping for a deep and meaningful chat beside the cooking oil selections.

“Get a load of this. $27 a litre for that Cold Pressed Extra Virgin Organic Olive Oil. You’d think you were buying a jug of Russian Imperial Stout at your local craft brewery,” he said, trying just a bit too hard to make our reporter laugh.

Our reporter laughed and agreed regardless.

“This is the shit you want. Black & Gold Vegetable Oil. Cheaper than a night at the Phuket Crab Races. Mate, I’m telling you. There’s fuck all difference between this stuff and the shit they pump out of the Earth’s crust to make diesel and styrofoam out of. Dollar and a half for 600mL. Can’t walk past it.”

But with a bit of needless prodding, The Advocate could tell that deep down, the professionally-uninspiring Virgo would rather be taking out a second mortgage to buy the good oil.

“Daph[ne] used to put that fancy oil on her salads she used to pack for lunch,” he said, holding a bottle of the fancy oil in his left hand, next to the vegetable variety in his right.

“She used to say it had a multitude of uses. From frying to dressings to shotting it on a dare at a kick-on. Hope that new fuckwit in her life knows how much she likes it,”

“Honestly, my life is better now. I’ve got more time to hang out with my friends. Things are chugging along just fine and dandy.”

World First As Man Successfully Nods Off Reading Matthew Reilly’s ‘Scarecrow’

TEXT:

The literary world has been rocked by news that a young local man has successfully fallen asleep while resting his eyes as he read Matthew Reilly’s 2003 bestseller Scarecrow.

Dylan Harrison, a Betoota Heights leasing agent, is currently reading 462-page high-octane novel for the fourth time and is being touted as the first person in human history to nod off while reading the book.

Speaking to The Advocate this morning, the 29-year-old said that he was shocked to find the book still open on his navel when he woke around 5 o’clock this morning for work.

“Jesus,” he said.

“The last thing I remember was Shane going over that cliff and Knight and Gant getting pinged. Then bang, my alarm going off. My bedside lamp was still on,”

“That’s never happened before. A few minutes after I got out of bed, the phone rang and on the other end was some bloke from the CSIRO telling me that I was the first one to do it.”

Australia’s peak scientific body found out about Dylan’s world first after his life partner took to social media to post a photo of a tuckered out Virgo asleep with the book on his ‘little tum tum’.

Our reporter spoke to Wendy Pearson, who’s been in a mildly-committed relationship with Dylan for a few weeks now, about the world first.

“That’s how I debuted him to my followers,” she said.

“He just looked so cute with his little book like that.”

The Advocate reached out to Reilly for comment but his management says he’s stuck down the shops trying to help someone jumpstart his DeLorean DMC-12.

Blockchain Technology Set To Be Replaced By Something That Makes Sense To People

“But it’s so transparent and free,” he said.

There was a pause.

It was late and Michael Rust, a Betoota Grove private asset manager was tired.

“Who gives a shit? And why would we want that? So governments and poor people can see what we’re doing? So the financial systems around the world become fairer? Who in their right mind would want that?”

“Poor people want job security and the promise of a brighter future. That’s it. Blockchain is the Pokemon of the 2010s. It’s a passing fad.”

Another pause.

“I guess you’re right, Mike.”

Speaking to The Advocate this morning, the 55-year-old said he’s sick of his clients ringing up to discuss cryptocurrency and ‘whatever the blockchain is’.

While Rust admitted he doesn’t fully understand or care what blockchain is, that doesn’t mean he needs to do his research.

“I’ve had people try and explain it to me a few times and it sounds stupid. If it doesn’t benefit rich people then it won’t catch on. If the current system of hiding money or making transactions through shelf companies isn’t broken, then why fix it?”

“Fuck me, I hate young people! You should hear them all. Well, I’m sick of it!”

“The blockchain or whatever it is will be replaced by something that makes sense to the layperson. Because if they think they understand it, they can be exploited. Just like our current system. They stay poor and my clients and I stay rich. Simple.”

The Advocate reached out to a number of known local crypto enthusiasts but all of them had since woken up to themselves and got a CommSec trading account like a grown up.

New Teacher Still Under Impression Spending Own Money On Classroom Supplies Can Be Deducted From Tax

TEXT:

Drowning in debt, going bald from stress but glad to finally have a job in the industry, a bright-eyed and freshly qualified teacher told The Advocate this morning that she’s really been enjoying her first year in primary education.

Sandy Greenwich’s group certificate has been sitting by the disconnected landline in her Betoota Heights sharehouse for a few months now and the deadline to have your tax return in is fast approaching.

So like any self-respecting 24-year-old go-getter, she set aside last night to get all her receipts together and take down them the road to the local tax accountant.

She told our reporter that when she left her money man’s office, her opinion of working in education had changed somewhat.

“I spent nearly $6 000 of my own money on school supplies that the school couldn’t afford or simply wouldn’t buy for the kids,” she said.

“No hard feelings against the school or anything, or even the department. They have to make sure every kid gets their fair share of the funding pie – but I at least thought I’d be able to claim things like crepe paper and edicol dye. They’re classed as student expenses, which you can’t deduct from your tax,”

“Fuck me! Why didn’t anybody tell me! That’s basically business class to Japan and back! But the kids need these things but I also need things!”

Cough-laughing and rolling her eyes, a 30-year veteran of the teaching trade provided comment to The Advocate this morning in the wake of young Sandy’s fiscal epiphany.

South Betoota Public School teacher Brenda Gilmour said she feels for Sandy and can empathise with her position.

But the 62-year-old said Sandy probably wouldn’t be making the same mistake twice.

“You just need to make do with what the school gives you,” said Brenda.

“Which is fuck all but that’s the skinny of it. You just need to make it work. You’ve got these suckhole politicians who can claim everything from a clandestine visit to a massage parlour to a dozen shucked oysters in Beirut – and we can’t even claim a pair of sucking Hush Puppies,”

“And it’s the same regardless of who’s in power. Fuck the lot of them.”

Bachelor Annoyed He Still Hasn’t Made Love To His Burnt Slow Jams Mix CD From 2002

TEXT:

As a 12-year-old boy, Stephen Doohan burnt himself a slow jams mix for the express purpose of charming an overly-polite and awkward girl in his class – Mary.

While he has grown, his sense of what constitutes something to be appropriate or not has not.

Recently, the comically-tense Gemini moved out of his parents leafy Betoota Heights display home and while he was in the act of packing his room, he found the old mix tape.

“From a simpler time,” he told our reporter.

“I made this mix for a girl called Mary. Don’t know what happened to her after primary school. She moved away, I think. My parents had this Packard-Bell that had a sticker on it saying ‘Never Obsolete!””

“Funny when you think about it. It had a CD burner and I made like hundreds of mixtapes.”

Stephen let out a big sigh and turned to look out the window.

“If I have Mary’s slow jam mix CD then that means she obviously didn’t want to accept a mix from me – the ultimate humiliation for a 12-year-old boy,” he said.

“But then again, I might’ve kept it to have as a general soundtrack to many of my planned lovemaking sessions; the same ones that never happened. God, I can’t even think about how much of a poon I was back then,”

“It’s OK, I’m cool now, but? Right?”

Coal Lobbyist Legitimately Wonders If Coalition MP He’s Buying Lunch For Has Brain Damage

Working on behalf of a number of local coal miners and power companies, it goes without saying that Sam Ferguson gets to wine and dine on the company card more than most.

He doesn’t get his hands dirty – unless of course, you find cold hard cash to be filthy.

Part of his role as a lobbyist for the coal industry, the 31-year-old often meets with politicians from all sides of the political divide and then buys them a lavish lunch.

“It’s just how things are done,” he said.

“We have a discussion over lunch and we try to come to an understanding. Some parties are easier to deal with, more my industry especially, that others. But most come around when the money comes out so it’s not really that difficult,”

But today, he says, was different to other days.

Sam explained to The Advocate that this afternoon he had lunch with a prominent Coalition MP who impressed him for all the wrong reasons.

“He was saying these things. Things that made me wonder if he had brain damage,” Sam said.

“After telling me that hydro is turning koalas gay for twenty minutes, he then regaled me with facts about solar energy that spooked me a bit,”

“Saying things like, ‘solar energy is destroying traditional family values,’ and ‘wind power causes brain cancer in sheep,’. I can’t believe my job is this easy sometimes. All I said was coal is a proven source of reliable energy and he basically said he’d do anything I told him to do. I think he might legitimately have brain cancer.”

Fox Screaming In The Night Enough To Rattle Visiting City Boy To His Very Core

In town for the Betoota Gold Cup at the weekend, homely Brisbanese man Dennis Spears was woken in the night by a blood-curdling scream.

“What the fuck was that?” he said, springing up in bed.

The 28-year-old was so confronted by the noise that he decided to wake his host, Mike Pearson of Yulumba Street in the French Quarter, to ask if they should go investigate.

Speaking to The Advocate this morning, Mike said the lights went on in his room not long after they got home from the pub at around 4am.

“So Dennis has come in and told me that somebody was being murdered out the front of the house,” he said.

“Naturally, I got up. Put my ugg boots on and followed Dennis out the front. Nothing. He swore he heard some girl scream or something. Then we both heard it.”

Pearson then began laughing as he told our reporter what happened next.

“Won’t be the first time, won’t be the last,” he giggled.

“It was a fox. The first time you hear one scream in the night, it’ll shock you if you don’t know what it is! They sound just like somebody being stabbed to death in the night. Google it if you don’t believe me.”

The friends then said they retired back to their beds – but not before Mike had told his group chat that he shares with Dennis all about it.

Mums Rings To Inform Child That Prince Harry Is Here With His New Wife And That’s Exciting

It is probably the most exciting thing to happen to Betoota Grove mother-of-four, Wendy Spock, this calendar year.

Save for perhaps the conception or unplanned birth of her first grandchild.

Prince Harry arrived in Australia this morning with his popular new wife Megan Markle – and Wendy is barely keeping it together.

Speaking exclusively to The Advocate this morning, the 29-year-old* spoke to her youngest son Paul who’d just arrived at work.

“I just had to tell everybody, I’m so excited!” she told our reporter.

“I’ve already spoken to all my girlfriends about it but that didn’t satisfy me enough so I’ve decided this morning to individually call each of my adult children to tell them that my second-favourite royal is in the country,”

“My favourite is The Queen, of course. It’s just so great! I’m driving down to Dubbo this weekend to see them in person!”

Paul, when he later spoke to our reporter, was not as excited as his mother was but claims he understands why Baby Boomers like the Royals.

However, he said he didn’t have time to articulate that because he’d just arrived at work and had a lot to catch up on.

“So Mum rings me six times this morning so naturally I think Dad’s fucking brown bread or something. Like she’s walked in on him in the shitter this morning and he’s gone and Elvis’d himself or something, you know?”

“Turns out she just wanted to get onto me about Prince Harry being here. Big whoop!”

“We’ll be a republic in the next decade or two, anyway. I can see through this PR coup. Anyway, I can’t really speak now. Cheers.”

Serial Schooner Killers Keen To Add To Their Tally Of Victims This Afternoon

It’s a glorious afternoon in our great south-west and two of the town’s most polite and happy-go-lucky youngsters are keen to murder a few local schooners this afternoon as the soft atumn sunlight warms their shoulders.

Though it’s not the first time Lindsay Cappoo and Digby ‘Gorilla Tits’ Frost have been seen looking for victims of a Friday afternoon and it certainly won’t be the last.

But this afternoon has an air of mischief in it – one seldom felt unless all their drinking planets have aligned.

Lindsay spoke to The Advocate via mobile phone as he drove to pick up his friend.

“When the clock strikes 4pm, I’ll be heading over to pick up Digby from work and then we’ll head out and try find some innocent beers to kill,” said Cappoo, a marginally employed party bus pilot.

“Then once we found a few, we’ll get on the group chat and beckon the boys to come and enjoy the kill with us. Catch up over a few bodies! [laughs] Seriously, but. I’m thirsty for a few fucking beers! I could murder a couple I reckon!”

Digby was also in high spirits when he spoke to our reporter, saying that it’s a great afternoon to have a couple of cold Betoota Bitters in a nondescript beer garden with friends.

Catch Up With Less Successful Friend Puts Local Woman’s Anxieties At Ease

After a particularly heavy week of work after a particularly heavy weekend last week, a local city worker has made time to catch up with an old friend who’s largely unsuccessful – in order to put her doubts about her own life at ease.

Louise Pichot knew on Wednesday night that she’d need a bit of a lift before Saturday so, in order to get it, she organised to see Olive Spearman.

Olive and Lou went to school together and used to be much closer but life commitments and work have seen them drift further apart.

However, they make time every now and then to see each other and catch up.

Lou spoke to The Advocate ahead of the planned meet up at a popular small bar in the French Quarter tonight.

“I had a big weekend on the gear last weekend. Like vomiting in front of people and completely losing my mind. Don’t know what came over me,” said Lou.

“Needless to say, the first few days of the week were especially tough. I never wanted to be a lawyer but here I am, a fucking lawyer at a giant firm surrounded by people who love playing corporate touch. What the fuck am I doing with my life?”

“Fuck! Why am I thinking like that? It’s a great job. I need to see Olive soon. She’s still living at home. Dropped out of uni and works at a cafe. I need to see what rock bottom looks like for me.”

“We’re going to the War Memorial tomorrow so today we’re doing the galleries,” said Nathan this afternoon via telephone.

The 27-year-old said he’d found time to speak to The Advocate after finding a husband chair at the Civic David Jones.

“So anyway, we’re clip-clopping around the National Art Gallery like a pair of lost brumbies when Luce turns to me and says, ‘Oi, that’s the most valuable painting in Australia,’ So I turned my big old melon to look and I was not blown away at all,”

“It looks like a fucking kid’s done it. I could’ve done it. It looks like some bloke’s just chucked a bit of canvas down on the garage floor and thrown paint on it. I’ve seen painter’s radios look better. Art is a silly business that I don’t understand.”

The emotionally-stunted Gemini then went on to say that Lucy wasn’t convinced – and that saying you can do just as good of a job as the artist is considered crass by some.

But, he says, he doesn’t care.

“What?” he said.

“Tell me I’m wrong.”

Nation Demands Public Apology From Nick Cummins For Not Entering Into Arranged Relationship

TEXT:

Television love-rat Nick Cummins arrived back home in Australia this morning where he was met with nationwide condemnation for opting not to enter into an arranged relationship.

After appearing on this season of The Bachelor, the ‘Honey Badger’ came to the conclusion that he’d rather not start a relationship with two women he’d grown close to in front of millions of everyday Australians – choosing to remain young, virile and single for the interim.

However, that wasn’t good enough for the wider public.

“I feel cheated,” said one Bachelor viewer.

“It wasn’t supposed to end like this. It was supposed to end with marriage and children. That’s what everybody in this world wants. It’s what true success looks like. Happiness isn’t a warm gun, it’s the sound of little feet and the soft heartbeat of your life partner beside you,”

“What a love coward. Open your heart, Nick. I speak for the whole of Australia when I say he owes us all an apology.”

Demonstrations against the talented utility back have been planned in every capital city for the weekend.

However, Cummins has remained positive throughout. Having just returned from Papua New Guinea, he took time out of his busy morning to speak to our reporter on the matter.

“Mate,” he exhaled.

“This whole thing is as cooked as the NSW Government’s books. I’m just a happy-go-lucky barnstorming winger slash fullback. I’m no Jude Law. I didn’t want to lead one of those girls on, only to turn around in a few months and say sayonara, you know?”

“I reckon I’ll just cut about town for a while and be good company, good looking and funny. That should fare me well, you think?”

Cricket Fan Clearly Punching Above Weight Happy To Watch Reality TV Instead Of Day 5 Tonight

TEXT:

He’s paying for the premium 4K Foxtel package that comes with their new dedicated cricket channel because he loves the sport more than almost everything.

Except, of course, for his partner-in-crime.

The Bonnie to his Clyde, Rachel Seymour, is a huge Block fan. Her dream is to one day buy a dilapidated French Quarter terrace and over-capitalise on it through a comprehensive renovation that places her and Michael Spoon in financial ruin forever.

Ask Michael and he’ll say it’s also his dream.

But in the short term, it’s the 28-year-old’s dream to watch the last day of the Test Match against Pakistan where the boys are up against it.

“They’ve got to last 90 overs. I’ll probably get the television after 9 but it could be over by then,” he said.

“I reckon the meat of the innings will happen when she wants to watch The Block or what-have-you. And I’m OK with that. I still look at her and wonder why and how this whole thing has happened,”

“Look, I know it might seem boring to the passing cricket fan but I live for this shit. Day 5 will be a mental battle of the likes we seldom see. If we can save a draw, it’ll be one of the great victories. It won’t end up in any highlight reels or anything, though.”

Our reporter spoke to Rachel about what’s going to happen tonight when she gets home – and it was largely the same as what Michael described.

“We love The Block and the Bachies. GoggleBox is like Mike’s favourite show,” she said.

“Why? What did Mike say?”

Melbourne Cup Craft Beer Hangover Eclipses Historic Record Set By Sparkling White

TEXT:

A pleasant day meandering through many of the French Quarter microbreweries turned sour for one local city worker last weekend – waking up on Sunday with what he feels is the worst hangover he’s ever experienced.

Sam Nakado, a corporate lawyer at Minter Clayton Poon Factory’s Old City District offices, found a TV playing Channel 7 with some old school friends from The Whooton School, and by his own admission, they painted the town red.

“Things got a little bit out of hand,” he told The Advocate this afternoon over the phone.

“One minute, I’m ordering a beer tasting paddle, drinking a pony of a dark beer that tasted like burnt toast and putting $50 on the favourite”

“The next, I’m moving money over from my Barefoot-inspired savings offset account so I can buy two bags of meth dressed as cocaine,”

“I spent about $900 on last night. So that’s like two bags and a dozen schooners of craft beer? [laughs] I’m on kidding! Anyway.

“That was probably the worst hangover I’ve ever had in my life. Way worse than the infamous PassionPop binge of 2009.”

Our reporter asked what used to be his hangover highwater mark before this one.

The 28-year-old audibly swallowed down the line.

He explained that it was just a run-of-the-mill blackout night most well-adjusted Australians have had in their lifetime – except for one small detail.

“It was the height of summer and we were young,” he said.

“We had a graduation party and got stuck into the el cheapo white varieties as soon as the formalities at school were over and done with. Being largely inexperienced with alcohol, I had a whole case of PassionPop and passed out at 4am in the middle of the backyard. The sun came up and roasted me until noon,”

“I needn’t explain any more, it fills me with anxiety.”

Our reporter agreed and hung up the phone.

Man Unable To Read Room Drops Second C-Bomb After First One Somehow Failed To Go Off

TEXT:

“I was simply retelling a story verbatim,” he said.

“I’m not the Daily Telegraph, I’m not going to exaggerate and outright lie just to make something sounds better – or worse than it actually is!”

Earlier this afternoon, Stacey Kelly found himself being cringed at repetitively over lunch as he recounted a story from a recent bucks weekend he was on – repeating every word as it was spoken.

He spoke briefly to our reporter this afternoon in the smoking pokies at the South Betoota RSL Club where he explained that he did nothing wrong and his co-workers need to lighten up.

“All I said was, ‘so the dumb cunt went and did it, despite us telling him not to,’ and my boss’ mouth puckered up like a fucking cat’s arse! Two female coworkers of mine let out a big sigh and rolled their eyes,” he said, coughing up something he later spat and rubbed into the pokie room carpet with his Hush Puppy.

“Jumping Jesus, lighten up would you? It’s just a word!”

One of the female coworkers Stacey mentioned took time out of her bust afternoon of trying to keep a level of decorum around her office to speak to our reporter about what happened at lunch.

Asking to remain anonymous, she explained that when Stacey saw his first c-bomb didn’t generate the laughter and backslaps he thought it deserved, he doubled down.

“Why,” she asked rhetorically.

“Men are so weird. Not all men but men like Stacey who can’t read a room. Jesus Christ, mate. Please don’t say that word around me! It is not nice! I’d say that to his face but he’s my superior so I just have to pretend laugh and wish I’d listened more in school and had a better job!”

Fancy Regional Mum Uses Proper Table Manners At Italian Restaurant

TEXT:

A polite local mother has shown off her more cultured side this week at a dinner with friends.

Enjoying some Italian cuisine and a nice bottle of red down at an authentic Italian place down in the French Quarter last night, Joce Anthe put her table manners on full display.

The regional mother of three has always prided herself on her ability to turn it on when she feels like.

From her table manners to her elocution, Anthe can wine and dine with the best of them.

So that’s why during her meal with a couple of other mums from around Betoota.

Nudging her way through nice Cab-Sav, Anthe pulled herself her first slice of pizza down onto her plate, before impressing her tablemates by taking to it with a knife and fork.

Speaking to The Advocate this morning, Anthe explained why it’s nice to carry yourself with a little bit of class from time to time.

“Enjoying a nice meal out with the girls, I don’t wanna stuff my face with a Sassari like some pleb,” Anthe said.

“I mean some people don’t know any better, and that’s fine. But I was always taught the importance of table manners, so when you are out at a nice joint like this one you should treat it with a bit of respect.”

“Intermittent Fasting Will Counteract Weekend Of Treating My Body Like Garbage Dump”

TEXT:

For the past 48 hours, Brittany Seldom has been stuffing her face like it’s her last day on earth.

Having gone on a weekend getaway, Brittany’s binge eating marathon began with a large bag of salt and vinegar chips, followed by two separate stops at a fast food chain that rhymes with schmickmonalds.

The following hours followed in a similar vein, Brittany did not discriminate against any food groups.

When questioned about whether she was concerned that her body was a walking garbage dump for two days, Brittany’s response was naive at best.

“Nah it’s fine, I’ll just fast from Sunday night to Monday lunchtime”

“Fasting just resets everything, like if I have eaten all this crap, my body will eat it during the fast – it’s like It’s tapping into the fuel I already have”

“Do you get me?”

Despite Brittany’s best attempts at explaining her diet hack to our reporter, the science and legitimacy of her claim don’t add up.

According to a local biomedical scientist, while intermittent fasting has been proven to have restorative effects on the body’s cells, eating junk food will counteract the fast.

“Yes, binge eating junk food will completely void any health benefits of intermittent fasting, Brittany is grossly misinformed,” said the scientist.

So, while there is some truth to Brittany’s intermittent bingeing, it generally only works if the body isn’t stocked like the south Betoota Tip.

Breaking: There Is A Dog In The School!

TEXT:

Central Betoota residents are advised to be on high alert for fun times as a dog has been spotted running through the quadrangle at Betoota Primary School.

The unidentified dog has reportedly caused chaos during recess time after it entered the quad through an unknown entrance and has proceeded to chase a couple of birds and allegedly licked Samantha Hickey (9) on the hand.

“It licked my hand when no one was looking,” stated Hickey who was probably lying as she previously stated her cousin was on The Bachelor but wouldn’t say which one she was.

Teacher on duty David Murphy (42) reportedly told the students not to approach the mixed breed dog but couldn’t resist giving it a little pat as he unsuccessfully tried to usher it out of the school grounds.

“Ran right under my legs. Cheeky little shit.”

At present, the situation has been classified as a serious threat to productivity and staff have been instructed to take precautions to ensure no student put a hat on the dog and bring it into the classroom to be taught like a student in the style of the naughties Disney cartoon Teacher’s Pet.

Packs Of Awkward Teenagers Lurking Outside Cinema Suggests It’s School Holidays

TEXT:

Reports of packs of skinny, lanky and badly dressed teenagers lurking around Betoota’s entertainment precinct have had phones ringing off the hook here at The Advocate this morning, which can only mean one thing – it’s school holidays.

The entertainment precinct is popular amongst teenagers, not necessarily the indoor facilities like the bowling alley or cinema, but rather the concreted footpath and car park surrounding it.

One woman, who wished to remain anonymous, reported to The Advocate that a male teenager with an ear piercing and heavy metal chain leered at her before saying “show us where you piss from.”

It’s understood that while these packs of dero-looking teens are relatively harmless, police have issued an approach with caution warning as the packs’ behaviour is often times unpredictable.

“Much like a pack of wild dogs there is a hierarchy amongst the teens, which means that the alpha is always being challenged.” Sergeant D Linquent told our reporter earlier.

“These challenges can come in many forms; seeing who can smoke a cigarette the fastest, or spit the furthest, or if it’s a skate crew the teens often poorly attempt kickflips”

“All of this stuff is harmless, however, if you get too close they can stalk you and try to pester you into buying them alcohol, more cigarettes, or even marijuana.”

“It’s best to give the pack a wide berth to avoid any unsolicited interaction.” Ended the Sergeant.

Given the scungy appearance of the teen packs, avoiding them like the plague is almost a certainty.

Unescorted Mother Comes Back From The Shops With Coronas Again

TEXT:

It’s often screamed from the rooftops around the world – Corona is the beer from where you’d rather be.

However, according to a Betoota Grove man, he’d rather be anywhere but where Corona is from.

Speaking exclusively to The Advocate this Thursday afternoon, Bill Woxford, a local 24-year-old full-time stay-at-home-son, painted a grim picture of what unfolded when he told his mother that he ‘didn’t care’ what beer she bought when she rang to ask earlier today.

“We’re having family over on Saturday which means Mum does the shop on Thursday for the specials, you see,” he said.

“Not saying that we’re poor, I’m saying that Mum just loves a bargain. Anyway, she rang up around 3 this afternoon and woke me up to ask which beer she should buy. I told her I didn’t care. Turns out that was a lie.”

Shortly after young Bill hung up abruptly on his homemaker mother, Wanda Woxford, sighed and wondered what she and her emotionally-vacant husband did to deserve such a layabout, man-boobed son.

But the unpredictable Cancerian didn’t dwell on it, she just tack rolled the shopping trolley into BWS and loaded her up with sickly, imported beer.

“I can’t believe she’s done it again. The beer in the fridge is always Betoota Marathon Mid or Bitter. Not this crap. God! I should’ve gone with her.”

Our reporter spoke to Wanda shortly after she finished bringing the groceries in, by herself.

She outlined that while she doesn’t mind doing absolutely everything around the house, it would be nice if ‘people’ showed an interest in ‘perhaps’ helping her from time to time.

“I know he doesn’t like Coronas. He told me last time. But if he’s going to just lay about on the couch and steal my cigarettes then fuck him. He’s getting Coronas,”

“They were on special, anyway. Two for $90. Can’t walk past that.”

Banking Royal Commission Set To Shoulder Blame For Causing Impending Property Crash

TEXT:

The Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry is set to take the blame for causing the impending, unavoidable crash in property prices next year.

Damien Spoon, head of the Australian Bankers Association, has told journalists today in Sydney that everything was fine in the industry until the Royal Commission came along and exposed how they’ve been keeping the ship upright.

“What did they expect?” said Spoon.

“Did people honestly think that the everything in the banking and financial sector was above board? No! And they didn’t care. Just as long as we kept the economy chugging along and property prices growing, they didn’t care,”

“Now that the cat is out of the bag, they’ve ruined it. The responsibility for the upcoming downturn in the property market rests on the shoulders of the Royal Commission and they know it. They’ve ruined it for everybody.”

The Advocate reached out to the chair of the Royal Commission for comment but his police guard explained to our reporter that he’s currently not taking interviews.

Irate Heavily-Modified Car Lashes Out At Government Decision To Scrap Tampon Tax

TEXT:

A local hotrod has taken to social media this morning to criticise the plan by every state treasurer to scrap the GST on feminine hygiene products.

Nathan ‘Frogstomp’ Peters, an 85-year-old 3-window lowboy Deuce chop top coupé from Betoota Heights – the aspiration heartland of our town – lashed out at the tax axing, explaining that in his opinion, lady gear such as tampons and other things of that ilk are actually luxury items and should be taxed as such.

His controversial Facebook status is published in full above this article.

The Advocate reached out to the eight-cylindered hot-head just moments after he published his articulate, 334-character opinion to gain some insight into the man for this story.

What our reporter discovered failed to surprise even our most seasoned, Walkley-Award Life-Banned journalists.

Peters, who earned the nickname ‘Frogstomp’ due to his lifelong love of grabbing green frogs out of the toilet and stomping on them, told our reporters that he meant everything he posted this morning.

“Did you know that tampons kill more women than they save each year?” he said via telephone.

“I didn’t think so. They’re not actually necessary for their life, they are a luxury item. What about man-only products such as condoms and Wolfmother tickets? They have the GST on them? Why?”

Our reporter rocked back in his chair, looked up at the ceiling and wondered why he didn’t do something vaguely useful with his life – like engineering or medicine.

Then he realised he didn’t listen in school and thus relegated himself to a life in journalism whereby the only way to keep your head above water is to stand on the heads of those drowning underwater.

Our reporter then hung up on the modified car.

Man Farewells Any Remnants Of Youth He Had Left By Visiting Madame Tussauds During Overseas Trip

TEXT:

Though he’s only 31, a local man has bid farewell to his youth and all the things that go with it after he was discovered posing with various wax figures at the London Madame Tussauds this week.

Oliver Redman, who’s been awkwardly teetering on the tightrope between middle-age and youth, told our reporters that he’s finally fallen off the wrong side.

“The transition has been long,” he said, just days after the images surfaced on Facebook.

“I’ve got grown-up things like a mortgage and a long-term girlfriend – who isn’t just nice to look at but also is great company – but I’ve also got things young people have like a bowl of weed in the garage and a billy,”

“But yeah, I guess you could say I’m a fully fledged grown up. Millie and I are on our first big trip Euro together and naturally, we started in London. But the thought of dropping our bags at the Airbnb and immediately heading out to find affordable, high-quality cocaine didn’t really appeal to us – for some reason.”

So rather than starting a hard pinting session at their local Wetherspoons, Oliver and Millie decided to visit the Tower and all the other old shit you see in London now that they’ve closed down The Church.

However, it’s widely considered by many that the final frontier, the last thing you do when you’ve exhausted everything a city has to offer, is to visit a Madame Tussauds.

“And we did just that,” he said.

“We literally had nothing better to do, so we went to Madame Tussauds. It was like £40 entry and about as interesting as a John Howard TED talk. But Millie enjoyed herself,”

“To be honest, I’d rather be writhing around in a hostel bed having been out at Infernos all night on the gear but at the same time that idea scares the shit out of me.”

Atheists Eat Humble Pie As God’s Answers Scott Morrison’s Prayers For Rain

TEXT:

A group of local atheists have thrown their hats in the dirt and eaten humble pie today after the Bureau of Meteorology has forecast heavy storms for most of the eastern seaboard this week – including drought-stricken parts of New South Wales and Queensland.

Last month, Prime Minister Scott Morrison asked people around the nation to pray for rain as only He has the ability to make it rain when times are tough.

While almost every God-less man, woman and angst-riddled teen collectively rolled their eyes at ScoMo, it seems the Member for Cook as had the laugh last.

Speaking to the media today in Canberra, Morrison said now wasn’t the time to gloat, it was time to thank God and his popular son Jesus for bringing rain to farmers.

“Even though they bred them without having any means to feed them. Even when the season looked like it was getting dryer. Even when their gamble didn’t pay off and they cried on television saying they’ll lose their multi-million-dollar asset because the gamble didn’t pay off – He was there,” said Morrison.

“Then we asked Him to bring rain and my friends at BoM have told me that rain is coming. So shove up up your arse, atheists.”

The Prime Minister then made a dad joke and called the press conference closed.

It All Makes Sense After Bowtie-Wearing Classmate Reveals Himself To Be Christian

TEXT:

The mystery surrounding a local business student’s choice to wear a bowtie to class has been solved after the 21-year-old revealed himself as a soldier of Jesus Christ, a popular magic man from yesteryear.

David Pearlman, a second-year business studies student at South Betoota Polytechnic College, confused a number of his classmates for a long time with his wardrobe choices.

Some chalked his bowtie penchant up to him being eccentric, a bit different to other people.

“Which is fine,” said Tania Kline, who’s been in the same class as Pearlman for the past semester.

“Some people wear bowties in a smart casual way, which to most people is odd but some people like it. Then there’s the chin strap beard and wispy moustache. Again, kind of odd but nothing wrong with it,”

“But it all made sense after he tried to get us to come to church with him. He’s a Christian! I can’t believe it took me this long to cotton onto it. Ah well. He’s a nice guy and everything, it’s just funny.”

Pearlman was nice enough to speak briefly to The Advocate this morning via telephone where he explained just why he loves the bowtie and button-down combo – and the invisible boogieman, Jesus.

“I just think it looks cool, which I guess is why people wear the things they do. It’s a personal preference. Why is this even news?” he said.

“Honestly. You’ve called me up on a public holiday to discuss why I sometimes wear a bowtie to uni. Go take a look at yourself in the mirror,”

“If I wasn’t a Christian, I’d probably actually come over to your office now and give your brain a full factory reset with my bare hands. Not even Charlie Teo would be able to restore your hard drive after I’m done with you, brother. Maybe I could do it and then just ask God for forgiveness? But I won’t. Have a nice day.”

“Look At All These Collingwood Bandwagoners” Says Australian Lakers Fan

TEXT:

Inner-Melbourne native Carl Tonello (38) is unhappy with all the Collingwood Magpies bandwagon supporters who ‘tarnish the game he loves second-most’ after basketball, of which his favourite team is, and always has been, the LA Lakers.

An Australian rules football fanatic, Tonello states he almost had a chance with the VFL but passed it up to spend more time studying commerce and playing pick-up basketball whenever a film such as Space Jam or Airbud has recently played on network TV.

Although he spends most of his time working and getting pissed in Melbourne’s CBD, Tonello is outraged by the casual fans throwing support behind his hometown Magpies, a team he rarely shows support for as they haven’t made a snapback cool enough yet.

“Fakers. Bet none of them have ever pegged a pot at some loose-lipped Swanie-sucker for hanging shit on Joffa,” stated Tonello.

“Bet they can’t even name one player.”

When asked how many Lakers players he could name, Tonello stated “Lebron obviously,” before continuing to talk about how much he hated middle-class Collingwood supporters for ‘ruining the game.’

“If you ask me, you’re not a Collingwood supporter until you’ve had your life ruined because someone thought you were being a racist when you were just having a go at someone fuckwit for being a fucking flog.”

“I’m not racist anyway because I go for the Lakers and they’ve got lots of black people on their team. Lebron for example. Metta World Peace I think. Yeah, Lebron.”

Mate’s New Relationship Comes With A Sock

Eyebrows were raised today as Dennis Procter turned up to his mate’s grand final barbecue with his lovely new partner and a sock.

The relationship might be only three weeks old but the 26-year-old’s friends say they’ve never seen the cynical Cancerian happier.

However, one thing that Dennis failed to mention to his friends prior to today was that the new relationship came with a sock.

Our reporter is currently on the scene at Mark Spearman’s leafy Betoota Heights display home, sitting on the Nick Scali with a cold tin of Betoota Marathon Mid between his legs while another of Dennis’ friends explained to The Advocate what a sock is.

“S.O.C.K,” he spelt out.

“Some other cunt’s kid. Apparently, he’s a real bag of shit, took off on them. Pretty sad, she’s such a beautiful person. The kids a real legend, too. Pretty shit at cricket, but. Dennis is trying to teach him how to play but he’s mad keen on Fortnite,”

Our reporter spat a mouthful of beer out onto the replica Noguchi table in shock.

“A sock? Jesus wept! Don’t let Dennis hear you say that,” said our reporter.

His mate laughed.

“He’s the one who coined the term. He reckons the sock is a great.”

But many at the party concede that perhaps Dennis might be a bit young to start this phase of his life, considering his private education, law degree and hedonistic lifestyle.

In saying that, those people aren’t prepared to say that to him in person.

Our reporter tried to rouse Dennis’ mother, who’d just washed half a sheet of valium down with two bottles of bargain bin prosecco, for comment but she was unresponsive even to a very firm sternum rub.

Anti-Vaxxers More Concerned About Autism Than Recalled Airbag In Car

TEXT:

Despite warnings that the Takata airbags in their 2009 Honda Odessey could go off at any time and send deadly shrapnel through their brain, headrest and roof, a breeding pair of local anti-vaxxers have revealed that ‘they’re not too concerned’.

In fact, they’re more concerned about exposing their soon-to-be-born child to deadly vaccines which they say have been proven to cause a smorgasbord of potential health problems such as autism and sterility.

“The risk of our airbag killing us is almost zero,” said French Quarter resident, Banjo Clemente.

“Yeah. We’ve done our research on the airbag industry so we know the truth. The truth is that the Takata airbag recall is just a false flag for the government to put vaccines into your air conditioning.”

His life and spiritual partner, Bucket-Bong Reindeer, nodded and clicked her fingers as the 27-year-old Banjo punctuated each truth bomb by slamming his index finger down into the opposite hand’s palm.

However, our reporter spoke to a largely incompetent sales executive at South Betoota’s second-largest Honda dealership who said the complete opposite.

Larry Boink, who shot to local fame in 2006 for throwing rocks from the Stanley Street footbridge at passing vehicles, said that the airbags in Clemente’s Honda Odessey ‘pose a huge risk to life and limb’ and need to be replaced as soon as possible.

“It’s basically like driving around with a claymore strapped to the steering wheel, one little accident and everything that’s inside your skull will be on the outside and your organs will be well on their way to being in some half-fucked old white dog,”

“In terms of not vaccinating your kids, this is way more dangerous. That’s not without saying that not vaccinating your kids is safe because it’s not and it constitutes child abuse,”

“But I don’t make the rules, I just sell Hondas, play FIFA and smoke enough cones to make this planet seem habitable. See you all in hell.”

Office Unisex Toilet Clearly Used Exclusively By Pigs

A drift of city working pigs have marked their territory in an Old City District office unisex toilet by pissing on the floor, leaving the seat up and letting the cleaners pick anything up off the floor.

Though there are two women who work on the second floor of LJ Hooker’s inner-city offices in town, they elect to use the bathroom downstairs because the men they work with are grots.

Speaking candidly to The Advocate this morning, one female leasing agent (who asked to remain anonymous) said that there used to be an air of decorum and civility in that unisex toilet – but that’s since ended.

“They’re pigs. All of them,” she said.

“I feel sorry for their partners. I mean, there’s one guy in the office who obviously needs to go and see a doctor. He’s in the hurt locker for 40 minutes twice a day and leaves the porcelain looking like a monochrome Jackson Pollock,”

Big Kahuna Turns On The Charm At Airport Check-In Trying To Jag Himself An Exit Row

A local happy-go-lucky, correctly proportioned man is on his way to the coast for the long weekend.

But first, he must suffer the indignity of being a man of charming heft flying on a budget airline.

Lewis Smokeman, a French Quarter grain trader, told our reporters that he tried to jag himself an exit row as he checked in this morning by turning on the charm at the counter.

“I noticed that the check-in lady was wearing this big old engagement ring so I complimented her on that,” he said.

“Turns out it was the wrong hand but she said thanks anyway. That made what I was about to ask her a bit harder, though,”

“Dropped a hint that I might like an exit row seat, considering I’m 201cm and a buck ten. That’s a big old boy in any language. I am the big kahuna. But yeah, she said nah. They’re already been a few big kahunas check in before me, apparently.”

After treating himself to a 9 am $12 airport schooner of Tooheys New and a ploughman’s lunch, the 29-year-old made his way to the gate for the flight to Brisbane.

As it turns out, most of the Betoota Dolphins third-grade team were on the same flight – heading out on their end-of-season footy trip to Port Moresby.

Sometimes Mark Annesley-Wright bounces it a few times on the polished concrete floors to herald his arrival into the room.

His new role as office sportsguy has put him at odds with the rest of his team, most of which agree that the 28-year-old’s presence in the workplaces has a negative effect on productivity.

“I had no idea what an ACL was until I started working here,” said one colleague.

“It sounded to me like some sort of car but as it turns out, it’s a little tendon inside you knee that prevents fuckwits like Mark from playing sports ball,”

“Honest to God, once he even bounced the ball right up to my desk, fucking pulled out of my headphones out and asked me if I wanted to go for a drink with him after work that Friday. I’d rather paint the ceiling Cobain-style than spend a minute with that droopy-eyed dough-banging fuckboy outside of work.”

Our reporter, clearly taken back by Mark’s coworker’s sentiments, said thanks and moved onto another worker on the same pod as Mark.

However, she too had roughly the same feelings about the guy who’s rarely seen either doing work with or without a ball.

“He must be some cunt’s son,” she said.

“Because nobody wants him here but he’s probably going to be the first to make partner. When does life start becoming enjoyable? I’m all fucking ears.”

Band Of Friends Use Up Entire Footpath Walking Three Abreast Like They’re The Fucking Bee Gees

TEXT:

Nobody knows where they’re going – but they sure as hell look like they do.

It’s just after 12 in our town’s Old City District and the various suits, smart casuals and the plain old shit-kickers dressed in mufti have flooded out of the offices in search of a $10 lunch special.

The narrow, windy streets have footpaths just wide enough to walk single-file each way, however, it seems nobody’s told Tommy, Danny and Sammy from the local abattoirs’ sales team.

They were seen walking three abreast down Willis Street toward BONA [Betoota Old And New Art] taking up the entire footpath, forcing oncoming traffic out onto the street and the faster walkers behind them seething.

All three were too caught up in their own world on self-importance and zero spatial awareness to speak to our reporter, who watched the whole scene take place from across the street.

The Advocate spoke to a long-legged, quick-walking hospitality professional who ended up stuck behind the trio of casual strollers – something he says quickly ruined his day.

“You know I’m not having a very good week,” said Myles Freakford.

“I’m 90% sure my ex, who broke up with me two years, is now seeing somebody significantly more successful and better looking than me. My hours just got changed from day to night shift. Cricket is still in turmoil and Cheika’s not taking Sam Carter to Japan. My life is a shambles,”

“Then these fuckwit slow walkers taking up the whole footpath like they’re the fucking Bee Gees or something. I just wanted to punch one of them in the back of the head. Not really. But yeah, I’m just so fucking stressed man.”

Our reporter patted young Myles on the back then went back across the road.

Strawberry Grower Glad Something’s Finally Pushed Finding Needles in Fruit Out Of The News

TEXT:

“Something equally as pathetic,” she laughed.

“Honest to God, they public servants. Get on with the job of serving me, you cunts.”

Angela Sans has had a trying month.

The first thing that when pear-shaped was the fact most of her strawberries were undersize this year – the second being the aforementioned ‘needle-in-fruit’ controversy that’s affected almost every consumable good imaginable.

But the popular strawberry grower says there’s an air of normality returning to the industry, now that her beloved aggregate accessory fruit has been pushed off the front pages of newspapers.

“I think there’s been a direct correlation between the media coverage the whole needle business has got, to the number of cases reported,” she said.

“Maybe, just maybe, they should’ve just stopped reporting on it. Then maybe nine tonnes of my strawberries wouldn’t be rotting in a fucking creek right now? Anyway, it’s over now. I hope things can go back to normal,”

“Also, we’re in a drought out here. Even though we’re fully-irrigated and in a greenhouse, I want some drought assistance. Oh? Only people with sick, starving livestock get media coverage? Well, I’m a primary industry that’s been thrown under the bus, where’s my care package?”

Our reporter shrugged and turned the recorder off.

Homeowner Moaning About Property Market Dip Somehow Expects Renting Bag-Of-Shit To Care

TEXT:

A gibbering old sexagenerian and taken time out of his busy morning of doing fuck all to ring his 26-year-old son to complain about the rapidly-cooling housing market.

Despite owning seven dilapidated French Quarter terrace houses and a palatial, leafy Pioneer homestead in Betoota Grove, Walter B. Cummins said he feels hard-done-by by the world and he needed an ear to complain to.

So he rang the only person he knew would answer at 10 am on a Tuesday morning – his shift-working doctor son, Michael.

“It’s fucked,” he said.

“I’ll do my arse if I’m not careful. You see that new Jaguar out in the driveway last week? I’m drawing that down from number 46 on Rue de Putain and it’s just had 4% of its total value wiped off it since June,”

“Mate. It’s a tough world out there. I might even end up living with you at this rate, I’ll have to cut your mother’s credit cards up.”

Predictably, Walter’s rant was falling on deaf ears and was preaching to the wrong choir entirely.

Staring down a HECS debt of close to two hundred thousand dollars, Michael Cummins said that as a medical doctor, he can’t see himself entering the property market until he’s at least 40 or 50.

He blames a number of Howard-era reforms to the property and asset tax legislation that makes it more tax effective to draw down against appreciating assets, rather than pay the capital gains on it like a moron.

“Honestly, does this gibbering old cunt think I feel sorry for him?” Micheal asked our reporter.

Our reporter shrugged.

“Do you feel sorry for him?”

Our reporter shrugged again.

“Well, you fucking shouldn’t. Fuck him. He’s got six mortgages on the hop now. I hope interest rates go up to 8% by 2020. Wouldn’t that be funny?”

Gentle Bondi Boy Lies To Himself And Says That His Roosters Still Have A Chance On Sunday

TEXT:

Even though his birth certificate says he was born under a boree tree some seven miles from the Betoota City Limits, a polite, smooth-palmed Diamantina expat has looked himself in the mirror this morning and told lies.

Since 2013, Connor Halleford has called the beachside Sydney suburb of Bondi home.

His youth in our state’s great South West is a distant memory; so distant that he’s turned his back on the Cowboys and has let his soft heart be stolen by the Sydney Roosters.

Never the less, the lie he told himself this morning, just after he brushed his comically white teeth, was that the Roosters still have a chance of beating the Storm this Sunday now that Billy Slater has been cleared to play.

The 31-year-old spoke to The Advocate this morning via telephone where he continued to lie to himself repeatedly.

“We are probably actually equal favourites at the moment,” he said.

“We’ve got the home ground advantage and Latrell Mitchell is the greatest player in the whole competition. Cooper Cronk is on the bench. It’s like Friday Night Lights except we’ll win,”

“It doesn’t matter that Billy ‘Protected Species’ Slater is playing, [Boyd] Cordner will neutralise him all game. Do you think I sound worried? Ha!”

Our reporter did think Conor sounded worried but admired his ability to stay positive in such a dark time for himself.

Housemate Chalks Sudden Appearance Of More Salt In Kitchen Up To Magic

TEXT:

There’s not much Natalie Smithson won’t put salt on.

The 28-year-old’s favourite drink is a French Quarter staple – vodka, lime and salt water.

She even grinds a fine mist of sea salt over her cocoa rice cereal of a morning time, telling the other residents of her jazzy Betoota Heights red brick sharehouse that it enhances flavour in the right amounts.

Needless to say, the popular solicitor goes through a lot of sodium chloride.

“But I just can’t seem to get to the bottom of a grinder,” she told our reporters.

“Whenever the salt gets low in the shaker, it magically gets filled back up to the top again. It’s actually mental.”

Her housemates are also of the same opinion. They’ve never run out of salt, too.

“It must be magic,” said Olivia Granger, who lay slumped in the living room beanbag treating herself to an inside cigarette while her housemates were still at work.

She let out an earth-shattering cough and tried to spit the byproduct of it out the window but hit the curtain.

“Fuck,” she said softly.

“Fuck it. But yeah, back to what I was saying. We have a magic salt man who breaks into our house twice a month to replenish the salt grinder when it runs out. He’s the bin man’s cousin, who kicks our door in every Friday and takes the garbage out from the kitchen out to the truck,”

“Magic.”

Oliva rolled her eyes and told our reporter to get out of her house.

He did.

6-Month-Old Pin Discovered In Button Squash After Somebody Actually Buys One

TEXT:

Police in South Betoota has confirmed that a small needle was discovered inside a yellow button squash today, reigniting fears of a serial offender in the local area.

However, detectives from the Food Vandalism Command have been able to date the pin as being from late March.

“That means it’s been in the squash undetected for close to 6 months,” said Detective Inspector Douglas Larson.

“As it turns out, the serial pin sticker the nation has been hunting for the past few weeks might’ve first chosen to cripple the yellow button squash industry first before turning their sights toward strawberries,”

“The button squash industry is worth around $60 to the national economy each year and the run on effects could’ve been catastrophic. I can, at this time, confirm with a reasonable amount of confidence that this was probably the only button squash stuck with a pin so feel free to go ham on them if you’re reading this. Cheers.”

As the crime happened such a long time ago, police have said they have no leads and are asking members of the public to come forward with any information.

South Betoota Police have offered a relatively fresh packet of John Player Special Reds as a reward for any information leading to the arrest of the yellow button squash needle bandit.

Shorten Finally Wins Over Youth Voters With Soundcloud Rapper Tatts

TEXT:

With as little as five months until Australian’s vote in the next federal election, opposition leader Bill Shorten has made a bold appeal to young voters with a neat collection of Soundcloud rapper face tattoos.

Seven hours late to his interview with VICE magazine, the Labor Party leader flicked a lone dreadlock off his face to reveal several face tattoos, including one of his new “rap name” Lil Shortz.

“Brrrr!” stated the man who could one day be Prime Minister, flicking an index finger across his lips to imitate the sound of a vibrating phone.

Not apologising for his tardiness, Shorten further held up the interview as he waited for a staffer to bring him a styrofoam cup stating he “gots to have his drank [sic].”

“Ay, ya, Albo did that one,” mumbled Lil Shortz pointing to a red and black switchblade tattooed on his cheek.

“He was quite rough, it hurt quite a bit actually.”

Expected to announce election policies regarding health and education, Lil Shortz instead spent most of the interview calling Morrison an ‘oldhead’ and a ‘hater’ as well as encouraging viewers to look up his diss track which according to him is “available on the sound cloud.”

“We out here taking shots.”

When asked to answer questions about fiscal responsibility, Lil Shortz promised to be responsible with tax payer’s “cash-money” and if elected would spend very little on “lean and Balmains.”

“Sco-mo or Sco-no-moe as I call him, he give $32 bil to private schools, that shit is whack. My plan? Fuck school man, school is lame, it ain’t shit!”

Currently, Lil Shortz is leading as prefered Prime Minister for people too young to vote and unregistered voters who think disregard for proper political process is cool.

Cold Tins Of Kirks In The Fridge Makes Trip To Nanna’s House Worthwhile

TEXT:

A trip to nanna’s house became a trip to remember today as grandchild Devan Wheeler (13) discovered ice cold tins of Kirk’s Lemonade in the spare fridge.

Sensing that she’d have a mutiny on her hands otherwise, Nanna Leighton (70) dished out the discount drink to her grandchildren who seemed to prefer the cost-efficient sparkling lemonade to more well-known brands of soft drink.

“I like it better than 7Up,” stated young Devan Wheeler.

“And way better than LA Ice Cola. When she has that I just drink water instead.”

Going down an absolute treat, Nanna Leighton’s seven grandchildren drank the carelessly named soft drink, soaking up enough sugar to ensure they couldn’t sit down to watch a DVD, electing instead to chase each other around the house in a game of ‘Real-life Fortnite’ that did an estimated $7,103 worth of damage to Nanna Leighton’s property.

“It’s so nice to have them around,” said a smiling Nanna Leighton as she swept up a broken urn of her father’s ashes.

“He would have loved these kids too!”

Despite witness statements that there were smiles all round, one person has come forward to state a disdain for Nanna Leighton’s Kirks pushing ways.

“I’m the one who buys the bloody Lido,” stated baggy-eyed grandpa Rob Leighton.

“She just takes all the credit and doesn’t hide a few tins behind the frozen sauce so when I bloody want some, there’s still some left!”

According to Nanna Leighton, giving the lemonade to her grandchildren is a tactical decision she makes in order to stop her diabetic husband from drinking it himself.

“He knows he’s not supposed to have it but he’s cheeky! I can see where the grandkids get that from!”

Private School Principal Says Playing Field Is At Risk Of Being Levelled Without Public Money

TEXT:

The principal of the exclusive Whooton School in Betoota Grove has outlined the dangers of losing public funding in a letter to parents this morning, saying the school’s brand new playing field is in danger of being levelled without it.

Professor Graham Waterford said that he and the school’s board of trustees have worked tirelessly over the past five years to make sure the school’s world-class facilities like the playing field are not levelled.

“Like everything in life, things cost money,” he wrote.

“And the upkeep on a playing field such as the one we have here at Whooton is enormous. Upwards of five or six times the typical anaesthetist salary. As well as our fees, generous donations and other sources of income, our school depends on public money to keep it running smoothly,”

“As you might understand, removing public money from our budget can have run on effects that may negatively impact your son’s time here at Whooton. So please, lobby our local LNP representative and tell him you won’t stand for an independent school standing on it’s own. Explain that educating tomorrow’s leaders is not cheap.”

The Advocate reached out to Professor Waterford for comment but have yet to receive a reply.

However, a number of concerned Whooton parents reached out to our reporter, saying that they were beginning to feel concerned that they weren’t getting as much bang for their buck anymore.

Dennis Coleman, who admits sending his man-boobed and borderline illiterate son to Whooton has all but bankrupted him, spoke to The Advocate about his grievances with the school.

“I’m worried that my son won’t make a single connection there and won’t be able to get a head start. That and if they level the playing field, we might never know if he was destined to be a Wallaby,” he said.

“He’s only 13 but his coaches are telling me he’s got a great footy mind. It’d be a great shame if they levelled the playing field and we lost him to rugby league or something ethnic like soccer,”

“And if it takes public money to keep him ahead, then so be it. I pay fees, I pay my tax. I pay more income tax than public school parents, anyway.”

Filo Household Extends Shelf Life Of TV Remote By Sealing It In Glad Wrap While Still Fresh

TEXT:

A prominent Filipino-Australian family from Betoota’s Flight Path District have today shared some of their domestic shortcuts.

Namely, keeping the TV remote fresher for longer, and in turn extending it’s shelf life.

The plastic-coating of everyday household items is a common occurrence within the Filipino diaspora, with reports of everyday items being placed in disposable Tupperware right across the Oceanic region, and further into the Americas and Europe.

However, while many look at it as simply a cultural quirk, Betoota’s Reyes family believe that cling wrap serves quite an important role in their day to day to lives, particularly when it comes to the remote.

“What you wanna do is keep it sealed the moment you get it out of the box” says Mr Emmanuel Reyes (55), patriarch of the Reyes household and prominent local businessman.

“You can get at least a couple more years out of them if you can limit their oxidations upon opening”

Similar to the Southern European migrant practices of heavily concreting their own properties, the Filipino-Australians are well known for their careful preservation of home-goods, from sentimental family heirlooms to random stuff they bought at Harvey Norman. Throught the use of cling wrap and old take away containers.

Earlier this year, it was reported that another prominent Filipino-Betootan family had confused their neighbours by not ‘cracking open the couches’ yet.

Italian Restaurant Pay Tribute To Famous Italian Mob Characters, And Scarface For Some Reason

TEXT:

La Beretta in Betoota’s Flight Path District has been a staple of family outings and noisy corporate lunches for several decades.

On top of their already homely atmosphere that includes light Italian jazz music and red and white plastic table clothes on the veranda, La Beretta has also adhered to the stereotype of having a framed poster of famous Italian-American mafia characters from famous TV shows and movies.

The fan-art, which sits on the back wall of the venue, includes a megamash of characters from The Sopranos, Goodfellas, all three Godfather movies and of course Scarface.

It is unknown why the poster features Tony Montana, considering his character is in fact a Cuban refugee in early 1980s Florida.

Initial theories that the poster is simply paying homage to famous Italian actors, which would include Scarface’s Al Pacino, were quickly dismissed by the addition of Marlon Brando as Vincenzo Corleone, a prominent non-Italian American actor.

The poster, while quite common for suburban Italian restaurants, also comes across as rather contradictory to the owner’s staunch hatred of Italian stereotypes.

Peter Russo (63) has spent his entire life detesting the discrimination faced by Southern European-Australian businessmen, and insists that he’s never met anyone from the mafia in his life.

“Mate, I pay my tax. I pay my staff. This restaurant even has eft-pos!” he shouts, at his own sons, while straightening the framed mafia-themed poster.

“I’m sick of these skippys and their bloody stereotypes that us wogs are dodgy businessman with irrational fucking tempers!”

Origins Of Disused Office Foosball Table Remain A Mystery To Entire Agency

Once touted as the next table tennis, a local boutique, bespoke, creative, fun, multinational mezzanine-level advertising and public relations firm has revealed that they’re the proud owners of a foosball table – but nobody working there quite knows where or how they got it.

Speaking exclusively to The Advocate, one of Colenso South Betoota’s bearded creative directors said that they have a ‘veritable smorgasbord’ of ‘things’ to entertain their staff between the ‘explosive bursts’ of creativity and account management like foosball tables and whatnot.

But while Denver Cairns knows where the agency sourced its disused table tennis table and disused boardroom motorcycle, he’s not too sure where the foosball table came from.

“That’s a tricky one,” he said.

“It reminds me of a campaign Saatchi Melbourne did with OPSM. Do you remember the one where the guy did that thing with the car and the talking eel? Yeah. Great campaign. Everything they do is pretty good. Ah, did you see the one that,”

“Oh yeah. The foosball table. Well, the table tennis table has Barcardi branding on it. So it obviously came from that campaign we did with them. The motorbike is from Moto Guzzi, I think. Or Ducati? Whatever. The foosball table hasn’t got any branding on it. So yeah, no idea. I sent around an email before you got here and yeah, nothing. Sorry.”

Coalition Advises Those Living Under Mortgage Stress Should Either Get A Better Or A Third Job

TEXT:

The Coalition leadership team has found a solution to the impending tsunami of mortgage stresses and foreclosures on the horizon by explaining that those people need to either get a better job or one that pays way more.

Federal Treasurer Josh Frydenberg and Prime Minister Scott Morrison fronted the media today after concerns were raised by voters around the country that the government wasn’t doing enough to prepare for an inevitable interest rate hike next year.

“The solution to mortgage stress is a simple one – for us especially,” said Frydenberg of the government’s predicament.

“Get another job. If you already have two jobs, like nearly two million Australians already do at the moment, then perhaps it’s time to get a third? We aren’t in the business of giving people money for nothing. Giant multinational banks and corporations that are so intertwined in all our lives now that their failure would have run on effects that last for generations? Yeah, we’ll bail them out if worse comes to worse,”

“Also, if you can’t get another job because you have other commitments like a family or something selfish like that, then just replace the job you already have with one that pays more money. Simple. That and the interest rates will go up after the next election so it’ll be Labor’s fault.”

However, many voters feel like that’s not a real solution to the problem.

The Advocate spoke to a few members of our town’s growing aspirational class about Mr Frydenberg’s comments today – all weren’t too amused.

Oscar Stanley, a puffer vest-owning small businessman and rugby union club man who thinks John Howard was God’s gift to Australia, told our reporters that he feels the banks should have to take some of the responsibility in this scenario.

“They were the ones who lent me $840k to buy a gyprocked, off-the-plan apartment in the height of a property boom with almost no deposit and no real tangible way to pay the mortgage if it went up two percent in a year,” said the 28-year-old.

“Now I feel like an idiot. The flat is barely worth $500k now and it’s only going south. But isn’t rent money dead money? I thought I was buying into the Australian dream? To own a Meriton apartment on the edge of a town’s second-largest business district?”

“Mate, I can’t get another job. I’ll have no time to sleep. And I’m still paying off my HECS. I asked my boss for a raise and he just laughed at me. What do I do? Can somebody tell me? I’m actually fucking terrified of what my future holds now. Can someone tell me that I’ll be OK?”

Indie Music Fan Crushed By Friend Recognising Name Of Band They Saw On Weekend

Sarah Goodhue was left internally seething this morning by a comment made during a run of the mill conversation with a colleague.

The mid-level brand manager at a PR firm in Betoota’s trendy French Quarter was attempting to show off her left field interests when casually explaining her weekend movements to a colleague named Sam.

“Yeah just went to a gig down at the Quarter on Saturday night, which was pretty sweet man,” Goodhue said, fully expecting the follow-up question about who she saw.

When that follow up question came, Goodhue rolled with her stock line:

“Oh man, not like a big name or anything, you’ve probably never even heard of them, Cattlefish and The Dog Boats they are called.”

While the interaction until that point had played out exactly how Goodhue had expected, what came next left the young woman in shock sipping her three-quarter full almond milk chai.

“Aw yeah, I know the Dog Boats,” colleague Sam nonchalantly replied before rolling off a couple of their songs.

The response rocked Goodhue and left her steaming.

Petulantly ending the conversation, the trainers and jeans clad woman spoke to our reporters about the interaction.

“I have got no idea how he (Sam) even knows them,” seemingly ignoring the fact that the show sold out Betoota’s 2,000 capacity hall in the French Quarter.

Goodhue then confirmed that she was probably done with the Dog Boats, and would start looking harder for more alternative music that no one listens to.

Aged Care Resident Attempts To Shank Someone In Bold Attempt To Get Decent Feed In Prison

TEXT:

A resident at a local Betoota aged care facility has opened up today about her bold plan to get a half decent meal.

Beryl Withers (89) who was residing in the ironically named Betoota Ponds Happy Village, spoke to our reporters about her incredible plan.

Transferred to the Betoota Correctional Facility yesterday evening with Grievous Bodily Harm charges levelled against her, Withers explained that she had been desperately craving a palatable meal with some sustenance, so hatched an ambitious plot earlier this week.

“Well you see, the food, if you’d call it that, which they serve up in the Happy Village, is inedible,” Withers said.

“And I grew up during the Second World War, so let me tell you, corn beef was a bloody treat for most of my childhood, so I don’t exactly have the palate of some of our politicians.”

Withers actions come after the Prime Minister announced a Royal Commision into the aged care sector due to years of horror stories and complaints surrounding the area.

One particular issue raised in recent days is the fact that aged care providers are providing $6 worth of food a day to their residents, which is $2 a day less than prisoners are treated to.

“Go down there and have a look at the food they serve up. Even the family dog would turn her nose up at it I tell you,” Withers said.

Withers explained that it was time to take matters into her own hands.

“Yep, so I just decided to poke a hole in one of the managers,” she said.

“I obviously made sure one of the nurses was close by, otherwise we would have been there for a few hours, but it’s worked out all okay. I made sure I put it in her leg so she’ll be fine, just a bit sore for a while. And I’ll get some half edible food!”

“You do wonder what it’s come to when you go to those measures to get horrible prison food, but I guess that’s just the way it is when you let private companies run aged care facilities.”

Withers explained that she is still contemplating whether to plead guilty or innocent.

“I’ve only been here for a few hours but it seems alright actually,” she said.

Housemate’s Level Of Piggery Exceeds First Estimates After It’s Discovered He’s Given Up On Bedsheets

TEXT:

The living conditions and personal hygiene of a remarkably unpopular Betoota Heights sharehouse dweller has left his housemate’s reeling after it’s far lower than what they expected.

For the past six months, Dana Rench has been practically living in bed – a bed without bedsheets.

The 24-year-old works nights at Sushi Bin out at Remienko Regional Aerodrome and often spends the daylight hours cooped up in his room using his laptop and video game console to pass the time.

His housemates understand that he survives off the leftover sushi he takes home at the end of each shift.

One of young Dana’s housemates took time out of his busy afternoon to speak to The Advocate about the recent discovery.

“The only reason why we went into his room was that we thought he was home and had his headphones in. But he wasn’t there. We are all going down to the shops to get groceries,” he said.

“We know he doesn’t like to cook but we thought he might enjoy the walk, you know? Whatever, anyway, we go in there and the place looks like hell. The smell was uncategorisable. It was just a dank, wet smell. The air was heavy to breathe,”

“We knew he was a piggy little boy but his lack of bedsheets, cleanliness and self-respect we all saw when the door opened means he’s exceeded our first estimates. This is a whole new dimension of human piggery. This is the net result of capitalism. Just the shit, man. I can’t begin to describe it. It was fucked.”

The Advocate reached out to Dana for comment but couldn’t locate him at the time of print.

While she conceded that her chipper mood yesterday might’ve given her the impression that she might’ve gotten away with a heavy weekend in Sydney but work today has ‘really sorted the wheat from the chaff’.

“I feel pretty bad, to be honest,” she said.

“Yesterday, I thought as though I’d escaped most of the fallout from Saturday but jumping Jesus, my friend, today is going to be a long fucking day,”

“Defcon was great but I’m glad they shut it down. I’m never going back there again. This morning waking up, I felt as if I’d woken up in the Marianas Trench. My eyes hurt and I feel like crying. Am I wasting my life? Am I really happy with it all? Maybe I should move overseas? Maybe that will solve all my problems. Starting again somewhere new. Far far away from this arid desert fuck hole here on the edge of the Simpson. Am I over-reacting?”

NSW Government Earmarks Parcel Of Land Near Badgerys Creek For Purpose-Built Nightlife District

TEXT:

The halcyon days of nightlife in Sydney is set to return after the incumbent NSW Government announced today that they’ve earmarked a parcel of land next to the Second Sydney Airport site at Badgerys Creek to build a dedicated nightlife district.

The move comes after Gladys Berejiklian’s government face criticism this morning after they elected to ban the Defqon 1 Music Festival from operating after two revellers tragically passed away over the weekend from suspected drug overdoses.

“Here, the revellers will be free to revel as much as they want,” said Berejiklian.

The district, which will be named by a popular poll early next year, will be zoned entirely for commercial property – meaning there will be no residents there to complain about noise and people pissing on their front doors.

“While a police station and medical facility will be built on the site, it will effectively be a lawless and fun as Kings Cross, Darlinghurst, the CBD, Darling Harbour and The Rocks were in the lead up to the Sydney Olympics,”

“Anyone alive and getting beaned out of their brains every weekend during that time can vouch for that. Of course, things like RSA and other licencing laws will be enforced, it will only be enforced to a Berlin level. Smoking will be allowed everywhere,”

“I trust this matter is now closed.”

PROPERTY CRISIS: Millennial Hatches Own Plan To Short Property Market After Watching 60 Minutes

TEXT:

“I’m as cunning as a shit house rat,” he said.

“So many of my friends have jumped into property ownership before they were ready. Struggling to pay a mortgage at record-low interest rates. Paying twice as much as they would’ve five years ago,”

“Idiots.”

Oliver Markson is a bright, young and ‘cash-rich’ city worker hellbent on creating his own financial destiny – by any means possible.

Friends told The Advocate that the popular former Whooton School prefect has always had a ‘side hustle’ to generate extra income while he worked as a clerk at his father’s French Quarter legal practice.

However, since sitting down to watch 60 Minutes last night in his parents palatial Betoota Grove home, the full-time-live-at-home son has hatched his own plan to short the property market and make ‘millions’.

The 29-year-old’s idea stems from his love of ‘The Big Short’ – a 2015 Hollywood film that heavily-dramatises and simplistically regales viewers with three separate but concurrent stories, loosely connected by their actions in the years leading up to the 2007 housing market crash.

“And it’s going to happen here,” he said.

Markson joined our reporter in a French Quarter cafe, where he outlined his scheme to get rich very quickly.

“I’ve amassed almost $50k in personal savings over the past seven or so years. I’m going to use that to short the banks and property-centric businesses such as Domain and Fairfax,”

“I’ve pulled all my other investments out. Resources are going south now, too. That’s often the first sign. In fact, there’s been lots of first signs but nobody, including the banks, wants to take their head out of the sand. When guess what? I have my head out of the sand and I’m going to make it.”

The Advocate reached out to a number of local property owners for comment but none of them really seemed interested.

However, one owner, who asked to remain anonymous, said that he’s just going to see how it goes.

“There’s not much I can do now, is there?” they said.

“Sell my house, lose money on it, then go start renting again? I’d lose a lot of money doing that. I guess I’m just going to have to ride it out, yeah?”

White Dog Does The Robot Then Drops His Guts On Local Pub Dance Floor

TEXT:

A largely unpopular local university student took to the dance floor of the Dickless Parrot Hotel in Betoota Heights last night to showcase his ability to do the robot while simultaneously dropping his guts.

Miles Perryford, a 21-year-old business studies from nearby Jundah, told our reporters that he often enjoys cutting the rug of a Saturday evening but clearing the dance floor with his foul effluence is something that just kind of happens sometimes.

The disgusting Scorpio spoke to our reporter this afternoon via wireless telephone about last night.

“You can do it because you can get away with it quite easily,” he said.

“It’s hard to pin the blame on somebody when you’re all in a crowd. So last night I was on the DF and the DJ was doing this really ham-fisted Daft Punk mashup. I was doing the robot and I felt that wagyu burger rotting in my guts. The gurgling and wheezing. And then I felt this hot pocket of gas start snaking its way through my body,”

“I guess it’s journey was hastened by my dancing. Anyway, I let it rip just has the drop was coming up in Waters of Nazareth. It was pretty bad, people were dancing and bopping along to the music with the most disgusted look on their faces. One girl even vomited.”

Our reporter was so appalled at Mr Perryford’s admissions that he hung up on him.

Boyfriend Yet To Discover Bathroom Has A Bin

TEXT:

It’s day 245 of living together for a young Betoota Grove couple, which also means it’s day 245 that Ben Hawkins is yet to discover the bin that’s been sitting in their bathroom the whole time.

Despite its obvious position, the bin has managed to elude Mr Hawkins on a number of occasions. Girlfriend, Bec Coffey, explained some of those instances to our reporter a little earlier.

“Where do I start?”

“When he changes the toilet roll, a process that’s impossible to carry out without seeing the bin, he just puts the empty one on the fucking bench next to the bin!”

“It’s like the bin is invisible”

“Oh, and dental floss!”

“There’s a pile of used dental floss on the bench, again, right next to the bin”

While putting these miscellaneous objects in the bin may seem like a simple task for Ms Coffey, Mr Hawkins shares a slightly different opinion.

“We have a bin?”

After informing Mr Hawkins of the angst it causes his girlfriend, instead of admitting the errors of his ways, he doubled down and stuck to his guns.

“But how can I put something in a bin that I didn’t even know what there?”

“Also, why wouldn’t she just put it in the bin if it bothers her so much and she knows where the bin is?”

It’s understood that Bec refused to put the bathroom waste away because she was trying to teach her boyfriend a lesson – a familiar scenario that rings true across Australia we’re sure.

Woman Getting Phone Repaired Unsure How People Survived Alone With Their Thoughts

TEXT:

The human experience proved too much for sales assistant Lauren Katter (26) today as she waited while her phone got repaired and was forced to survive alone with her thoughts.

Despite having direct access to food, water and a Michel’s Patisserie, Katter found it extremely difficult to feel safe and comfortable as she sat in a public space by herself.

“I was just sitting there. By myself. It was horrible,” cried Katter.

“I kept thinking about this time I asked my second cousin how they were after they’d already told me how they were. Far out, how did people used to survive like this?”

Desperate to distract herself from the nightmare odyssey of her own consciousness, Katter attempted to prolong her insanity by visiting a discount fashion outlet and buying four pairs of pants she didn’t even need.

Following that she stopped and chatted with a street pest for 20 minutes before lost $14.50 in a skill tester machine, trying to win a sun-damaged Canterbury Bulldogs ball that featured the club’s previous logo.

“Yeah, I kept myself busy. It’s a shame though, that would have made a great Insta story.”

After receiving her phone back, Howells stated she could feel her pupils widening and experienced the pleasant feeling of her arm being complete once again.

According to her Instagram, a post of her and her four useless pairs of pants was posted with the caption “Catch ya later thinking, it was nice knowing ya!”

Chubby Local Kid Looks Forward To Debuting Trendy New Rashie This Summer

TEXT:

For local chubby kid, Benjamin Knight (11) warmer weather cannot come any sooner as this dough-boy is dying to show off his spanking new rash vest this summer.

Unaware he was slightly larger for his age until his classmates decided to enlight him via bullying, Knight has fully embraced the chubby-chap lifestyle which has been largely helped by the widely accepted notion he can rock the fuck out of a rashie.

“Wait until they see this one,” smiled the full-cheeked youth.

“My winter bod is flaunting a summer rashie.”

Currently, Knight plans on wearing the rashie during his family day-trips to the beach but states he will also give the rashie a go in swimming pools and spas.

“When you’ve got a bad boy like this do you think you’re going to save it for the beach? It’s an authentic Quicksilver you know.”

According to Knight, as dazzling as he looks in his rash vest there are some people who think they’re doing him a favour by encouraging him to take it off.

“People seem to think that body positivity hasn’t reached short, prepubescent geeks like me who’d rather play Fortnite than learn how to dribble a basketball. I’m going to look hot this summer, I just hope mum can get my bowl cut just right.”

Concern For Mate Grows After He Chooses To Buy A Canary Yellow 2004 Holden Cruize

TEXT:

A concerned group of friends has contacted The Advocate today to voice their concerns over one of their own after he chose to buy 2004 canary yellow Holden Cruise with his own money.

Michael Astanda, friends say, made the decision to purchase the soft-roader while browsing the selection down at Colin Matthews Motors in South Betoota earlier this week.

The 34-year-old took to his group chat to break the news to his mates – but none of them thought he’d actually purchased such an affront to personal motoring.

“Yeah, we all thought he was trolling us,” said one friend.

“But, uh, yeah. Turns out he wasn’t. Johnno drove past his place up the Heights this morning and there it was. A fucking canary yellow Holden Cruize,”

“That didn’t really concern us, like we all thought he must’ve just bought it as a joke because, you know, Mike’s a pretty funny guy and all our girlfriends reckon he’s such a catch for someone. But ah, yeah turns out he actually reckons it’s a sick car. You think you know a bloke and then he goes and does something like this.”

Another friend spoke candidly to our reporter, saying that it was strange for Mike to buy a car that, ‘couldn’t pull the skin off a rice pudding’ considering that he’s a petrol head.

Just a few moments ago, The Advocate was able to get Mike on the phone to chat about his stylish new motor.

He was able to confirm his mate’s worst fears.

“I love it,” he said.

“A car is like a man’s diet. It’s his business and only his. I know that people might think I’m trolling people by driving a car like Bertie, yes his name is Bertie. But I’m not. He gets good mileage and the driving position is high so I can see,”

“That and people can see me, considering the colour of the thing. I don’t know why everybody is so concerned about it. Even my old man rang up and asked if I had lost my mind. I guess some people just don’t get it.”

Psychopathic Bourgeois Pig Cuts Power Cord Of Old Television Before Council Clean Up

TEXT:

An ageing French Quarter property owner has decided that if he can’t use his 14-year-old television anymore – nobody should.

Tomorrow is the bi-annual Shire Council Clean Up in Zone 2 of the French Quarter and Old City District and the streets are lined with trash that could easily become someone else’s treasure.

Seen driving around this morning in a rented Toyota Hi-ace, local merchant Simon Pearson said he’s been out since dawn hunting for something valuable that’s been cast to the curb by our town’s cultural elite.

He also spoke of how many discarded electrical appliances he’s found with the power cord cut with a pair of secateurs.

“I came across this big old tele on Rue de Branlette. It was one of those old rear projection numbers. Great for watching sport on and whatnot. I was chuffed,” he said.

“But I pulled up to take a look, I noticed that the cunt had cut the power cord so nobody else could enjoy it. What a fucking prick. Typical inner-city leftie fuck. They’re all for social justice but if it means actually getting off the Matt fucking Blatt recliner, they can’t be stuffed,”

“I know you can solder on a new plug, there’s probably going to be people in the comments who’ll say this without even reading the article and clicking on a few ads so you guys can keep this rubber-band powered operation afloat for another month, but I can’t be fucked doing that. And I’m no electrician, I’ll probably end up burning my house down doing it.”

Our reporter knocked on the door of the television’s former owner but he was too busy on the phone asking his architect friend if he thinks enough time has passed for him to be able to get Geoffery Rush to MC his daughter’s wedding without it being weird.

Local Property Developer Conveniently Knows Nothing About Poisoned Tree Near Latest Project

TEXT:

A local councillor who moonlights as a property developer has told police that he doesn’t know who poisoned a 120-year-old elm tree on Goldman Broadway in Betoota Grove.

The tree, which sits between Gavin Coleman’s latest project and Lake Betoota, has since died after a vandal drilled into the tree’s trunk and poured Round-Up down the holes.

However, police today have cleared the 49-year-old of killing the popular tree.

The news comes after Mr Coleman was able to provide a rock-solid alibi for the night the tree was allegedly poisoned.

Speaking to the media this morning outside the French Quarter Police Station, Gavin said he just wants to move on with his life now.

“A lot of people, including you media types, have all but accused me of poisoning this majestic old elm,” he said.

“But my name has been cleared and if any of you bastards, particularly you pieces of shit at the Betoota Bugle. Anyway, get out of my way, I’ve got boutique, bespoke townhouses to build.”

While Mr Coleman’s guilt is obvious to almost everyone in town, the City of Betoota has elected to leave the tree in state until they’re legally obligated to remove it.

Councillor Keith Carton, Lord Mayor of Betoota, spoke to our reporter about the police investigation a short time ago.

He told The Advocate that while his office and the police weren’t able to pin this act of environmental terrorism on Gavin this time, there are other avenues in which they can.

“I have a feeling any development application Gavin lodges in the future will be met with extreme scrutiny,” said Carton.

“That and we’ll be sending rangers every day to book the tradesmen’s vehicles parked on the verge. In addition to that, the fire warden and our representative from Work Cover will be stopping by,”

“It might not be a fine but it’ll surely cost him an equal amount.”

“What About The Diggers?” Asks Patriot As Party Guest Walks In With Carton Of Asahi

TEXT:

“Do you not remember what happened in 1941?” asked the 21-year-old.

“A little thing called Pearl Harbour – followed by four years of brutal, island-to-island jungle-to-jungle conflict that claimed the lives of thousands of Allied troops,”

“And you bring that beer here? What about the diggers? What’s wrong with a good Australian beer like Tooheys or the old Victor Bravo? Why you buying that shit?”

Alistair Huntley loves this country.

Every Australian should in their own way – but young Alistair often declares his allegiance to the flag when he and his mates are super munted.

It’s a source of unbridled scatness to some friends, they don’t want to talk about patriotism when they’re barely able to hold a conversation while they resist the urge to hug the person they’re talking to and telling them that they love them for being them – and only them.

However, something that the jingoistic Virgo cannot resist is his love of beer-centric protectionism.

This morning around 10, Alistair called a kick-on back at his Betoota Heights sharehouse (without even broaching the subject on the house group chat first) and made sure everyone visited the bottle-o down the road before it ran out of piss.

Speaking exclusively to The Advocate this morning, Gregor Redpath said he bought the carton of ‘delicious’ Japanese lager because he likes the taste of it – and the packaging is pretty neat to boot.

He told us that he and his friends were on cloud nine, enjoying the last of the warm mornings of autumn in the company of good mates. Half-cut and not a care in the world between them. The day could only be ruined by someone saying that these days were the best of their lives.

Mercifully, nobody did and they made the journey from the bottle-o down the road up to Alistair’s charmingly unrenovated terrace on the Pencey Prep School Road.

“We think Alistair had a bit of an episode,” he said.

“He said something about me drinking Asahi was an affront to the ANZACs or something. We all kind of laughed but Ali had that fucking Sean Bean look of disgust on his face, looking me up and down,”

“The whole situation kind of fizzled out and we all got on with the day. I’m pretty sure he taxed me a few because he was hosting us. Weird guy, man. Like Paul Keating weird.”

Bitter Twitter Enemies Don’t Know What To Do After Running Into Each Other In Person

“What do I do? Do I go over there and confront the guy?”

“Fuck! He’s seen me!”

Oscar Feeney-Ross hates Ezra Haddad with a burning passion – but they’ve never laid eyes on each other until now.

Using pseudonyms on the social media platform, Twitter, the pair have been trading blows for years. Often the insults get quite personal.

They’ve both dreamt about this day come. What would they do? How were they going to knock them out? Many questions were left unanswered.

However, today at the Elephant & Pogostick Hotel in Betoota Heights, the opportunity to take their relationship to the next level presented itself.

In the middle of the intense standoff was our reporter, who was innocently trying to enjoy a $9 rump special and a full-strength schooner of Fanta.

Ezra came over to speak to The Advocate on the way out to the smoking area.

“I’m going to bounce his little blond head off the floorboards like Cherbourg speed bag,” he said unconvincingly.

“But doing it in such a public space might get me arrested or worse – beaten up. Anyway, come talk to me later about it. We’re both here alone so it’d be fair, I guess.”

Just as young Ezra shot a death stare on the way out the back, Oscar stood up and made his way to the bar now that the coast was clear.

On his way back to his lonesome corner booth, he asked The Advocate ‘just what in the hell our reporter thought he was doing’.

“Why are you talking to that leftist wanker for?” he said sharply.

“The fucking Leftoota Advocate hey? I might just start buying the Betoota Bugle from now on. At least you get real news without bias,”

“You’re lucky you’re here with your mate, otherwise I’d have to fuck you both up.”

Oscar then laughed nervously to himself and went on his way.

Exhausted City Worker Lectured Yet Again By Jamie Oliver About How Easy It Is To Cook Every Night

It’s 8pm and Nathan Pekoe has just stepped off the D45 bus home from the French Quarter.

He picked up an exotic duck Pad Thai up at the Jones Avenue Shops in Betoota Heights before he started the long plod off the main road, down his generic cul-de-sac and through the door of his rapidly-depreciating display home.

The 29-year-old family law specialist spoke briefly to our reporter on the phone as he unwound on the couch.

“I’m just letting my spine decompress for a minute,” he said.

“But you’d never guess what’s on TV. That fucking shyster Jamie Oliver and his 15-minute meals. You know what? I’m sick of getting yelled at by disgruntled parents and magistrates only to come home and be lectured by some floppy-haired Hampstead fuck about how easy it is to cook dinner every night. Arsehole,”

“It’s not easy. I’m fucked. My back is fucked, my life is fucked and for some reason, I can’t sleep anymore. I wish they still had Rick Stein’s show on. He just went to nice places and ate food. He described what it tasted like any everything. Great show.”

Mr Pekoe then bid The Advocate good night as he finally mustered up the courage to get off the couch to get his now cold Thai food.

Font Size On Boomer’s iPhone Visible From Across The Room

TEXT:

An aging homeowner was the talk of the Royal Betoota Yacht Squadron today after fellow homeowners began mocking the 66-year-old over the size of the font on his iPhone.

Dudley Raleigh, a semi-retired piano tuner from Betoota Grove, was left red-faced this afternoon as the contents of his messages were able to be seen from the other side of the marina by younger, equally-well-heeled members.

Our reporter was present on the scene as the oddly-wealthy man bore the brunt of the agist bullying.

“Look at that,” laughed one 21-year-old Chris Craft enthusiast.

“I can read his messages from here! [laughs] How about you book yourself a visit to OPSM or something? How’s your macula? I can tell it’s fucked from here!”

A short but polite chorus of laughter erupted from the friends of the 24ft launch owner, who even had the gall to point.

Mr Raleigh, however, saw the lighter side of the conversation as he waved at the youths.

Speaking, in hindsight, unnecessarily to The Advocate about the confrontation, Raleigh said he didn’t mind the banter.

“When I was a young fella, we used to take the mickey out of old codgers all the time. Like I guess I am now,” he said.

“We had this one maths teacher who had these two huge hearing aids basically bolted onto the side of his head. We used to call him Mr Radar! Anyway, one day Radar comes into class and we all speak very softly to him on purpose,”

“So he turns his hearing aids up to the max, thinking he just had them too low. Then we all screamed at the top of our lungs and old Radar’s head almost blew up! Piss funny. Anyway, nice talking to you. I have to go wash the Riviera down now.”

Dutton Explains Difference Between ‘Helping A Mate’ And ‘Being Extremely Corrupt’

TEXT:

The Home Affairs Minister has taken to local radio this morning to set the recent au pair controversy straight and outline the difference between being criminally corrupt and just helping out a mate.

Peter Dutton spoke to Clive Overell this morning on KBBL South Betoota’s Breakfast With The Right People programme, where he distanced himself from claims that he should be held accountable for his actions.

“There is a difference between just doing a favour for an old mate and being extremely corrupt to the point where half of Parliment thinks you belong in prison,” said Dutton.

“When you’re in a position of power such as mine, it’s part and parcel of the job. What is the point in having power if you’re not going to use it?”

“Honestly. People on the left think that they’d be some sort of Ghandi-like figure if they had as much power as say, I do. Well, I don’t believe that. I’m just helping out one of the boys. Dogging the boys in politics is a testament to political suicide. You get what I mean?”

Leaving the KBBL Studios, Dutton was accosted by five youngish activists from the Polytechnic College’s Socialist Alliance who’d taken time out of their busy morning of tweeting witty quips about him to confront him in the flesh.

They shouted at him as he walked the seventeen metres from the front door to his waiting comcar. Dutton made eye contact with one but kept on walking.

Local Craft Brewer Reveals She’s Running Out Of Things To Make Beer Out Of

TEXT:

Looking down at the green frogs clinging to dear life in the toilet this morning, a local craft brewer said the thought did cross her mind.

“I wondered, briefly, if you could make a beer out of green frogs,” she said.

“Even if you could, but. The greenies would jump all over you.”

Denise Roper, head brewer at the fabled Elephant & Pogostick Hotel and Brewery, told The Advocate today that she’s fast running out of things to turn into a beer.

Take a walk down any fresh produce aisle at your local supermarket and you’ll struggle to come across something that the effervescent 28-year-old hasn’t turned into a delicious alcoholic beverage.

“My double avocado American red ale was well received,” she laughed.

“Then, I guess, others like my Warrick Capper Limited Edition Pecan Nut Pale Ale, was not well received. Ah well. This game is half experimentation, half contract brewing. But yeah, I don’t really know what else I can do now, I’ve basically made a beer out of everything.”

However, the raven-haired Scorpio isn’t going to stop.

She told our reporters that she’s taking her current predicament as a challenge, rather than a roadblock.

“I’m thinking about making a black grape stout,” she said.

“And I’ll call it the Grant Hackett Airbourne Nipple Cripple Dark Ale. Fuck it, I might even make it 14% and try selling it in 440mL cans. Think of the absolute chaos that’d reign if you had a six pack on your own,”

“Or maybe I could make a beer out of Gatorade? You know, so you don’t get hung diddy after a big day on the grog? The possibilities are actually endless, this whole article and interview are largely redundant now.”

Kurtley Beale Reportedly Looking For Work As A Dodgy Used Car Salesman

“We are getting some momentum. So it’s a shame he’s got this idea of selling second hand cars down on Parramatta road in his head. But yes, I’ll admit he definitely looks the part”

These reports follow Kurtley Beale debuting the slicked mullet / goatee combo at Suncorp Stadium last night.

Cheika says he saw signs of a career change in Kurtley Beale several months ago when the youngster debuted a Tarocash suit to a team lunch in Moore Park.

“I knew he was thinking about life after footy when I saw the turquoise tie on the black button up” says Cheika.

“And the hair cut.. He certainly looks like he knows how to wind back an odometer”

“He basically is the human embodiment of a Bruce Springsteen song right now”

Teammate Bernard Foley has also spoken out about the new look, and possible career change.

“Kurtley has told me on the side, that eventually, he really wants to put on about 30 kilos and sell second hand Hyundais for a living and become a well-known identity at the local TAB”

Environmentally-Conscious Forklift Driver Dreams Of One Day Being Wealthy Enough To Vote Green

“It’s something I aspire to,” he said.

“A brighter, more sustainable future for me and the planet. But first, I need to make some money.”

The road Mike Greenhauer is on is long.

It starts at the Betoota Ponds postal distribution depot and it finished somewhere in the leafy cul-de-sacs of Betoota Grove.

The 26-year-old unionised forklift driver hopes that one day he hopes the biggest worry in his life will be the environment.

“Right now, it’s job security and housing affordability that I’m most worried about,” he said.

“Then I guess it’d be wage growth and interest rates. But yeah, one day I’d like to be carefree enough to vote for the Greens,”

“Rich enough, too.”

Mr Greenhaur understands that on his journey from the bottom to the top, he might even have to start voting Liberal when he becomes a small-business-owning home-owner and elects to manage his own super fund.

“It’s part and parcel of growing up,” he said.

“Maybe I might even start worrying about immigration and people being disrespectful in general.”

Once his house is paid off and it’s worth many hundreds of thousands more than what he bought it for – and he’s essentially able to live off the franking credits his share portfolio is gear toward exploiting.

“But I will mellow in my middle age,” he conceded.

“The guilt of being who I am will end up crushing me. Like the Tell-Tale Heart beating under the floorboards of my renovated French Quarter terrace house! The shame and heartbreak of being successful will overwhelm me I know,”

“But it’ll all wash away when I cast my vote for the greens. Even though they’re the most divided and toothless major party, I don’t care. The environment is too important,”

Barnaby Joyce Uses Mind Power To Make It Rain

TEXT:

“Go Barn! Go!” they bellowed.

“You can do it! Make it rain, Barn! Wooooo!”

Barnaby Joyce made it rain this afternoon on a drought-stricken local farm today after telling onlookers he was going to harness the power of his own mind to bring the wet stuff.

Scott Morrison’s special envoy on the drought grunted and spat as he mustered all the mental energy he could – his eyes transfixed on the cloud.

The owners of Nappatunga Station out on the tip road began to jump up and down with glee as the mare’s tails up there on the edge of space sunk in the sky, transforming into dark cumulonimbus clouds as they neared land.

Taking in a quick sharp breath, Joyce finished off the cloud with a guttural, primal bellow.

“All of a sudden, it started to piss down,” said Nappatunga manager, Coulton Kidman.

“A great crack of lightning shot over our heads and Old Barn went down there and then on the claypan. Breathing heavy, he was. But as the first drops of rejuvenating rain slapped onto the back of his RB Sellars sports coat, he came back to life,”

“We all raised Barn up on our shoulders, like that little girl from the taco ads. Cheering his name and throwing his limp body around! A hero he is to our quite south-west corner!”

Joyce’s visit to Betoota wraps up tomorrow with the special envoy heading to Muttaburra this weekend to make it rain there.

Inner-City Creative’s Struggle Against The Man Subsidised Heavily By Cardiologist Father

TEXT:

The credibility of a French Quarter area creative is in ruins this afternoon as friends of the man discovered that his father, a prominent cardiologist, has been paying his rent and phone bill for the entire duration of his well-publicised fight against The Man.

The Man, thought to be Betoota Mayor Councillor Keith Carton, has been the subject of Dylan Hunter-Scone’s vitriolic writings and acrylic-on-paper artworks recently.

So much so that the 29-year-old was subject of a feature article in Art Almanac earlier this year where he described his motives and themes of his work.

“I’ve always hated authority,” he said.

“Growing up, I got expelled from like three different schools. Then I got rejected from art school but then when they saw my body of work, they called me back and offered me a spot,”

“Most of my art is about the ongoing corruption in our local government. A town planner told me to watch out, I said I’m prepared to die for my art. He looked shocked.”

However, The Advocate can reveal that after a simple google search, Dylan’s father is one of our paper’s editor Clancy Overell’s golf partners.

Dr Hamish R. Hunter-Scone (DVM PhD Diplomate ECVIM-CA (Cardiology)) is one of the Diamantina’s leading cardiovascular surgeons and a member of the board of Royal Betoota Country Club and he says his son Dylan continues to fill him with pride.

“Dy[lan] is the youngest,” he said.

“So naturally, the pressure was off him to follow in his father’s footsteps. My eldest, Johnathon, is a professor of orthopedics at South Betoota Polytechnic College [laughs] So Dylan was free to do whatever he wanted,”

“He got thrown out of Whooton, McAlister and Vexwood. Not even a sizeable donation could sway the boards. He ended up completing his leaving certificate at Vexwood but under strict supervision,”

“A large donation did, however, secure him a place at The Betoota School of Arts after the admissions board deemed his body of work to be unworthy. I’m glad he’s found his place in the world. Oh yeah, we’re also paying his rent and phone bill.”

Australia’s peak scientific body has issued a warning this morning of the dangers of the rapidly increasing numbers of videos surfacing online of people being swooped by errant magpies.

At a Canberra press conference this morning, a CSIRO spokesperson explained that the sheer volume of videos and the popularity of the magpie meme threaten to break the nation’s already fragile internet.

“If there’s one thing that gets everyday Australian’s mashing that share button it’s a video of someone getting swooped by a magpie,” they said.

“So much so, we’ve raised concerns with the Communications Minister this morning about the potential of Australia’s internet breaking under the strain,”

“We ask all Australians to please first consider whether your magpie-related content it worth uploading – and if it is, please do it responsibly.”

Closer to home, Oliver Gaite of Betoota Grove recently uploaded a video to Instagram of him being attacked briefly by the infamous Roberts Road magpie.

He uploaded it on Monday and since then, it’s clocked up almost a hundred views and dozens of likes ‘n’ comments.

Speaking exclusively to The Advocate this morning, Oliver said he felt his video was unique enough to warrant being uploaded.

“I know it’s that time of year when every youth-orientated journalist is expected to write about magpies and how they swoop – like this is the first springtime it’s happened,” he said.

“But what makes my magpie-related content different is that I just got my haircut and I was wearing my favourite raincoat so I needed to tell people about that. So I put it up on my story!”

“So scary. If only my stepdad was still around, he had a 410 that would turn that pesky bugger inside out!”

Branded Pack Of Town Smokes A Key Indicator Man’s Thirst For Wanderlust Has Been Quenched

TEXT:

Government propaganda and big sunscreen will have you believe there’s nothing healthy about a tan.

That’s according to Jackson Chongdale, who’s recently returned home to Betoota from a North American odyssey-of-a-lifetime.

However, the now-bronzed 28-year-old city worker wouldn’t tell you unless you told him.

“He’s pretty reserved, old Jackson,” said one friend who spoke briefly to The Advocate this morning.

“Not one to lead conversation but he certainly contributes to it with sharp, un-minced words. An efficient raconteur if you will. Loves to travel, but. He’s been everywhere he has. Europe and Africa. Asia, too I’m pretty sure. He’s done the whole cocaine thing in South America. Now he’s just back from the States,”

“Let the good times roll. He’s certainly got the wanderlust bug.”

When our reporter caught up with the worldly Picses, Chongdale asked if it was OK if they sat out the back of the Speight’s Coup Hotel in the French Quarter so he could regale The Advocate as he smoked a mid-afternoon dart.

As they found a table, Jackson slapped a fresh deck of branded town smokes down on the table.

“Oh, I see you’ve been overseas,” said our reporter.

Jackson nodded.

“Yeah, just got back from the States, my friend,” he said.

“Help yourself if you want, I’ve got heaps. My carry on had chock full of cigarettes. As an approachable-looking, polite young white man coming in from Los Angeles with nothing to declare, the chances they’d go through my luggage were slim-to-none,”

“But yeah, mate. It was amazing, hey? I could live in America.”

Real Estate Agent Under Impression ‘No Junk Mail’ Sign On Letterbox Doesn’t Mean His Flyers

TEXT:

A local remora fish has told coworkers today that he largely ignores the ‘No Junk Mail’ signs on area letterboxes when he does a flyer drop because he knows they don’t mean him.

Darcy Tuckwell, of LJ Hooker Betoota Heights, said he still drops his upcoming sale flyers into mailboxes that explicitly ask him not to because he’s under the impression people don’t want to miss out on a real estate bargain.

“It’s not that I ignore them, I just wouldn’t classify my flyers are junk mail,” he said.

“They’re just letting people know that I’m selling a house in the area and that maybe they should pop down. Or maybe if they’re looking to sell, I could get them top dollar for their clapped out display home,”

“Certainly not junk mail. Junk mail to me is something that’s carried straight from the letterbox into the recycling bin. The Betoota Advocate is junk mail – and actually a giant joke. It’s actually fucked what’s happened, you don’t deserve any of this. This interview is over.”

Many local homeowners in the greater Betoota Heights area have declared that they do, in fact, classify material such as the autofelating, self-important garbage that many real estate agents place in their letterboxes to be ‘junk mail’.

And according to Hudson Derwent of Catskill Avenue up in the Heights, Darcy is one the worst offenders.

“I’ve got a very prominent ‘No Junk Mail’ sign on my letterbox,” said Derwent.

“Yet once a week, I’m forced to look at that Tarocash slimeball’s beady black eyes. His face is always on his shit. It is by definition junk mail,”

“If you see him again, tell him to stop.”

Time-Rich Omnivore Harnesses Power Of Social Media To Take Aim At Vegans

TEXT:

“You’re a fucking idiot, mate,” he wrote.

“The only reason why we evolved to the point we are at is because fucking monkeys came down out of the trees and started eating meat. Being vegan doesn’t make any sense and science is on my side,”

“Vegans are fucking losers.”

From time to time, Will Proctor puts aside a couple hours here and there to really stick it to vegans via Facebook and Instagram.

The full-time live-at-home-son explained to our reporter from the comfort of his parent’s leafy Betoota Heights Federation homestead that he feels the need to educate people on why their diet is wrong.

In addition to that mean feat, the 28-year-old also articulated why the diet of somebody is his business.

“It’s simple,” he said.

“They’re wrong and I think vegans have this air of social and intellectual superior that’s completely and utterly unfounded. I feel like I’m going to fucking explode sometimes,”

“Like when Dad asks me to mow the lawn or take the bins out. Just fuck off!”

Our reporter, a self-loathing vegetarian, elected to press stop on the recorder and let himself out before his Monday could get any worse than it has been already.

Mr Proctor said he wasn’t finished but unfortunately for him, The Advocate was.

Reformed Smoker Replaces Filthy Addiction With Talking About How Strong His Willpower Is

TEXT:

Former smoker Ashley Hayes (36) is sharing his secret to quitting smoking, claiming that all you need to do is replace smoking cigarettes with talking about how strong your willpower is.

After a treacherous 20-months of social smoking, Hayes decided to stub a bummed cigarette for the last time in favour of letting his friends know how his willpower is a strong and unyielding force to be reckoned with.

Although he has no experience in motivational speaking, Hayes has now begun the first in a series of free lectures about her willpower to his peers and anyone else unfortunate enough to be within earshot.

“You know what else I’ve noticed now that I’ve quit? You guys all smell of smoke!” stated Hayes as he stood in the smoking section for some reason.

“I was going to use the patches but they’re so expensive I thought forget it, I might as well smoke. Then I remembered that when you put mind over matter, it doesn’t cost you anything.”

Attendees of the impromptu motivational seminars report that Hayes incorporates several stunts into the lectures, including holding a lit cigarette to prove her willpower and encouraging everyone to walk across burning butts to start their new life.

Local Man Pathetic Enough To Miss His Bag The First Time Round Carousel

TEXT:

A local traveller was kicking himself today. 

Brandon Smith, a 32-year-old plumber heading back home to Betoota this weekend was waiting politely at the baggage carousel for his luggage to emerge this morning.

However, after scrolling mindlessly through his feed of Instagram influencers, the Brisbane based tradie realised that he had completely missed his baggage. 

Running over to the exit of the baggage carousel, Smith arrived seconds too late, as he watched his suitcase meander back into the guts of the airport. 

Letting out a barely audible but charmingly public ‘Fuck’, Smith retired back to the back of the crowd at the Betoota Airport, coming to terms with the few minutes of his life he had just needlessly burnt. 

Smith explained that he then had to wait for the best part of five minutes for his baggage to return to the carousel at which point he was left standing alone and feeling silly. 

“I was just so shocked that my baggage came out first, I wasn’t ready for it,” he said. 

“It’s like cooking one of Jamie’s 20 Minute Meals in 20 minutes, it just never happens.” 

“So I wasn’t really paying attention, and then I missed it, and felt like a spoon,” Smith said. 

Smith then walked out of the empty terminal to his girlfriend who had been parked there for nearly 15 minutes.

Reemergence Of Paper Towel In Local Man’s Bathroom Suggests He Hasn’t Got Shit Together Just Yet

TEXT:

A promotion last year to senior network engineer came with an increase in his pay packet – enough to finally break the bonds of the sharehouse lifestyle.

“I thought then that I finally had my shit together,” said Bruce Coleman.

“My own kitchen, my own living room. A place to call my own. Finally, I was an adult. I even got one of those extendable dining tables for when I have guests, or paint Warhammer figures,”

“Mum bought me a Creuset casserole pot. I’ve cooked things that’d make Christ himself collapse into a tongue-speaking hot mess of flavour-induced ecstasy.”

But, it seems, his shit is not as together as it outwardly seems.

Speaking this morning candidly to The Advocate at the Jones Avenue Terminus in Betoota Heights, the weak-chinned but strategically-beared young man made that admission.

Around 7am this morning, a mild stomach cramp woke the 27-year-old from his slumber – as it does most mornings.

It was time.

“I made the short amble to my shitting closet from bed, dropped my boardshorts and took a seat. Just as I was about to achieve my digestive nirvana, panic.”

Young Bruce realised he didn’t have any goona wrap left. A frantic search of the under-sink cupboard came up nada.

“So I did what I had to do. I sucked it up and went out into the kitchen to get my Viva paper towels. I haven’t had to do that since I was living in a share house. I’ve even used Glad Bake before,” he said.

“It was surprisingly pleasant. However, I will make a concerted effort to pick up some toilet tickets on the way home from work today.”

Foolhardy Regional Man Actually Considering Buying Seafood From His Local Supermarket

TEXT:

As our town is among those further from the sea in this country, the local purchase of saltwater seafood is often a gamble.

Despite the assurances from both Coles and Woolworths, the fact that no local fishmonger stocks any saltwater seafood is enough to deter even the most iron-gutted local.

Enter Oscar Harris.

It’s half past five on a delightful Thursday afternoon currently and the city-working 25-year-old is in the mood for a special dinner.

“No occasion,” he told The Advocate at the Betoota Heights Woolworths.

“I just felt like treating myself.”

Which is why our reporter found him checking out the range of fresh seafood at his local supermarket.

“Atlantic salmon,” he said to himself.

“Man, that’s a long way away from here.”

Just as he was about to come to his senses and head over to the beef section, a delicatessen appeared and asked if he could help.

“Our salmon is 100% fresh,” they said.

“The seafood marinara mix is currently on special at $6 a kilo. Perfect for a hearty pasta dish. Perhaps even a Paella?”

Young Oscar pursed his lips and leant in for a closer look, his nose just centimetres from the glass.

“What about these tuna steaks?” he asked.

“Are they fresh?”

The delicatessen laughed and said yes.

“Hmmmm… Maybe I should just get a steak. Considering that it’s probably local.”

Suddenly, a brainwave.

“Actually, I’m OK. I don’t know what came over me.”

Oscar gleefully abandoned his full shopping cart of groceries on his way out to the butcher. Witnesses say he also lit a cigarette.

“I’m going to support a local business and visit my butcher and greengrocer. See you in hell.”

Tradie Who’s Worked On ‘The Block’ Has Strong Opinions On Scott Cam’s Carpentry Skills

TEXT:

“Mates,” prefaced Darcy Tuckwell.

“You should see what it’s like behind the scenes. None of the people you see on television do any of the work. They’re basically actors.”

The 27-year-old Betoota Heights carpenter took another sip of his Carlton-Mid while the mates he was telling the story to digested the first part of the tale.

In the hours after knock-off, the time between that and the sun going down, Darcy and his friends like to gather at the Betoota Racing Club for a few Thursday night warm-ups.

Some are professionals, others tradesmen. Few are wealthy, few are poor. But the one thing they’re all rich in is mateship and the bond of being a directionless, shit-scared 20-something just trying to keep their head above water.

“Fuck, this is better than that Iron Jack shit, isn’t it? What the fuck is a crabbing beer? Everybody knows it was a kneejerk reaction to Great Northern taking over and catching XXXX Gold while it was sleeping behind the wheel. At least you can drink Great Northern. I wouldn’t even caramelise onions with fucking Iron Wank.”

After a few muted laughs, one of Darcy’s mates suggested they get back to discussing Scott Cam’s ability to even drive a nail.

“Oh yeah. Mate, I doubt it. Heavily,” said Darcy.

“Oi, but wait on. Allow me, my friends, to regale you in a story I like to call ‘Scott Cam and the Mysteriously Dirty Half-Button Work Shirt’,”

“There was this scene they did. I did the season in Melbourne, that place in Praharn. Anyway, as the day dragged on, the script called for Scotty to lend a hand and put up a fucking door or something, I can’t remember, there’s been a lot of schooners between then and now,”

“So, the producer comes in and asks me to take my work shirt off, the one I’ve been working in all day. Naturally, I whip it off because they pay us cash and it’s a good gig. Anyway, two minutes later, it’s on Scott’s back and his putting the last screw in the hinge,”

“You wouldn’t read about it.”

Free Round Bale Of Hay And Grocery Hamper Solve Struggling Farmer’s Problems Overnight

TEXT:

“Ah yes. That should do it,” he said.

“Hasta la vista, El Nino. Nice knowing you. Hopefully, your sister turns up before Christmas!”

Local grazier John Pooley watched as the b-double of round bales disappeared over the horizon in a plume of auburn dust.

It left behind a hearty round bale of lucerne hay, kindly donated by an inner-city primary school. Those school children don’t know it, but they’re winning the war against climate change with each dollar they raise.

“Heartwarming, isn’t it?” John asked our reporter.

“And look over there. Somebody has shoved a hamper of groceries into my mail drum. Once upon a time, that drum was full of RoundUp. Now that it’s stopped raining, I don’t even need to buy that stuff anymore.”

The 33-year-old fifth-generation grazier has seen drought before.

Some droughts are worse than others but even this hardened primary producer concedes that this one is especially bad.

“Yeah,” he said.

“It’s pretty bad.”

He then, with some effort, pulled the hamper out from his mail drum to see what he’d scored this time.

“Savoury Shapes. Not my favourite, that would be Chicken Crimpy, but it’ll do. And look at this, Pop Tarts. Looks like I won’t be skipping breakfast this week,” he said.

“Get a load of this. Lavosh biscuits but nothing to dip them in. Not even a wheel of brie. These fucking sadists are laughing in my face right now.”

Peter’s thoughts turned to the round bale sitting at his farm gate.

He looked over his shoulder to the ram paddock. Almost a hundred thousand dollars worth of DNA lie dormant in their ball bags.

“They could use a bit of a pep up. I haven’t got much left for them to throw the leg over but you never know. My ewes are on agistment up on the River Road their between Isisford and Blackall. They’re eating better than me, it would seem,”

“So yeah, this will feed my rams. Yes, it will, indeed,”

“Along with this hamper, all of my problems have been solved. The war against climate change is over. Pack it up, we have won. I can’t wait to smoke an unfiltered Port Royal between the flags at Mooloolaba this year. Res ipsa loquitur, my friends – let the good times roll.”

Home-Owning Millennial Relieved Bank Of Mum And Dad Will Not Pass On Interest Rate Hike

TEXT:

As mortgage stress and tumbling property prices begin to increase for millions of Australian families, one local homeowner has breathed a sigh of relief as his lender today announced they would not be passing on the interest rate hike.

The Bank Of Mum And Dad (BMD), a popular lender among our town’s well-heeled upper-middle-class, announced that their rates wouldn’t be raised any higher than their current 0%.

Speaking to The Advocate a few moments ago, local two-bedroom apartment owner Alistair Walton-Cartwright said that he was ‘stressed’ and ‘nervous’ about the recent increase in interest rates but ‘can now sleep’ knowing his repayments will remain the same for the foreseeable future.

“I’ve got a good relationship with my bank,” he said.

“When I was looking to buy, the big four and a few smaller lenders were full of hidden costs like stamp duty and establishment fees. But when some politician said to try BMD, I was shocked to learn that it was much cheaper,”

“They even put my repayments on hold if I go to Europe for summer or if I accidentally spend all my pay packet one month. Dad kind of yells at me a bit but Mum always comes into bat for me and scolds him back! But when they said my repayments might be going up, I shat my chinos. Then Dad said not to worry so I didn’t! [laughs]”

The Advocate reached out to The Bank Of Mum And Dad for comment but have yet to receive a reply.

Smoked Oyster And Pizza Shape Appetisers Add Pizzaz To Man’s Otherwise Painful Existence

Complete with his and hers pre-dinner drinks, a plate of home-made appetisers greeted Glenn Miller as he walked in the door of his Betoota Heights home this evening after what was another painful day alive.

The 38-year-old IT professional poured himself through the front door and was greeted with the warm scent of John West smoked oysters while the familiar jingling of his wife’s bangles rang around the room as she enjoyed another large mouthful of cleanskin rosé.

“How was work?” she asked.

Glenn dropped his messenger bag by the couch and explained he’d had ‘an absolute cunt of a day’ – but now that he was home, he was feeling better.

Waiting on the kitchen island, a plate of Pizza Shapes topped with a smoked oyster that went out of date sometime in 2015.

“Just what the doctor ordered,” he said.

“This is just the thing I was feeling like.”

As he looked out the kitchen window, out to the backyard, as each complex flavour meandered through his tastebuds, the bitter-sweetness of the Betoota Bitter both complimenting and aggressively clashing with each tasting note – his problems started to fade away.

“This is just the amount of pizzaz my life needed right now,” he said.

“It’s not a win but it’s not a loss. It’s just an escape.”

Heavily-Scuffed Alloy Wheels Offers Insight Into Local Man’s Inability To Drive

Even the spare space-saving tyre in the boot of Darcy Mulligan’s late model Infinity Q50 has been scuffed beyond roadworthiness.

According to friends, the 28-year-old is living proof that a high income cannot buy you spatial awareness and the ability to operate a motor vehicle without reversing into the gutter each time you park.

“Yeah,” said the sales clerk.

“We can rim you, Darcy. Come back at 4pm and your rims will be looking brand new again.”

With a large sigh, he joined our reporter in the queue down the Jones Avenue taxi rank.

“My ‘mates’ always laugh at my rims,” he said.

“They say, ‘Hey Darce! Did you lend your car to fucking Ray Charles or something? Every panel has a fucking dent in it and there’s more crushed concrete in those rims than metal alloy,’ and stuff to that effect,”

“It’s not very nice. I think they’re jealous. Laughing at me while they cut about town in their 15 year old Barinas rolling stock rims. Being able to drive well is a byproduct of toxic masculinity. Guess what, guys? Some men are bad drivers and some women are better drivers than me. The joke isn’t funny, get a life.”

Local Woman’s Passport Photo A Confronting Reminder Of That Weird Emo Phase She Went Through

TEXT:

Sophie Yilmaz’s pre-holiday excitement took a hit today after she dusted off her 8-year-old passport and it fell open at the well-worn identification page. 

Staring back at Sophie was a shadow of her current self; a red-haired, side fringe sporting, black eyeliner wearing, emo version of herself – to be exact. 

“What the hell was I thinking?” She asked herself. 

“Who let me out of the house looking like that?” 

Sophie shut her passport, but her ghost-from-emo’s-past image stayed firmly imprinted in her mind. 

The Advocate caught up with Sophie shortly after her unpleasant trip down memory lane to talk about her transition from the devil’s ambassador to the seemingly straight edge brunette she is today. 

“I had no reason to be emo. I had a loving family, went to a private school, I have had literally no adversity my entire life.” 

“I’ll never know why I felt the need to be emo.”

“But yeah, there I am. I can’t wait till this thing expires and I can get a new one.”

Haunting and regretful passport photos are rife amongst the 25-30 age group, as more often than not, their first passport was issued when they were going through some kind of experimental phase and they’re yet to update it.

Some other top anxiety-inducing trends amongst older passport holders are ‘bangs’ – a shaped cutting of the front part of the hair so it lies over the forehead – bleached blonde hair, when fake tan was more like tandoori and when facial piercings were a thing you aspired for.

“Bonjourno,” said Charlotte Simpson-Smith, an Anglo-Saxon Betoota heights woman who just returned back from a two-week stint on the Amalfi Coast, in case you couldn’t already tell. 

Charlotte was greeting the half-Italian waiter at one of Betoota’s family-owned Italian restaurants in the French Quarter. 

“Ah Grazie Bella, parli Italiano?” questioned the waiter, Fabio, in fluent Italian.  

Unable to understand Fabio, Charlotte crumbled into a fit of nervous giggles.

“Hehe [sic] sorry I don’t know what you’re saying, I’ve just spent two weeks in Italy, so I only know a little bit.” 

“Ah ok ok, mie scuse Bella. What can I get for you and your beautiful friend?” 

“Could we please order garlic bread to start? Grazie mile” finished Charlotte with an unfounded tone of confidence. 

Catching up with Charlotte’s monolingual friend after dinner, the Advocate can confirm that not even she was impressed with her friend’s peppered Italian phrases. 

“Oh it’s just the pits, like, we know you were just in Italy – you uploaded 50 photos to your Insta story a day” 

“Who are you trying to impress with your bullshit Italian?” 

“It shits all of us.” 

The Advocate understands that with the mid-year holiday season wrapping up, a number of other people around town have returned dropping the odd foreign phrase into everyday conversations; arigato (Japanese for thank you), muchas gracias (Spanish for thank you very much) and even de nada (no worries in Spanish).

Recent Unpaid Bill Rules Out All Calls From No Caller ID

TEXT:

Ben Ashton’s recent altercations with a telecommunications company have forced his hand when deciding whether to answer the phone or not.

The 32-year-old from Betoota’s French Quarter is in the midst of a long-running battle with his previous telephone provider over money.

Feeling fleeced by the large multinational for excess data charges, Ashton decided to change providers and refuse to pay his remaining two monthly bills in protest.

However, this protest has resulted in frequent calls from said provider, chasing up the amount of money owing.

Ashton explained that for the majority of his life he has always endeavoured to answer phone calls from known and unknown numbers, but he is wise enough to know when to shelve the habit.

“Very rarely does someone actually call you off a private number. Very rarely. It’s usually a telemarketer, a debt collector, a company chasing a debt you have with them or one of my fuckhead mates who was pranking someone with a private number and forgot to change it back,” he said.

“If I don’t have any reason to be suspect I might answer.”

“But now that I have this debt with my ex-mobile provider, I can inform you that there is zero chance of me taking a call from a private caller,” he said.

“Not worth the risk.”

Ashton told us that he hopes to now just bury his head in the sand until the company gives up on the money and leaves him alone.

“I’m not paying it. On principle,” he said.

“I know they are not going to give me a bad credit rating or anything anyway. It’s all talk.”

“You Done?” Asks National Party

TEXT:

The National Party of Australia has today asked a big question of its political ally and longtime friend.

That question was, “Are you fucking done now?”

The Nats asked the question after one of the most calamitous weeks in Australian political history, whereby a bunch of individuals put their egos and personalities ahead of the interests of the nation.

After days of embarrassing infighting within their Liberal Coalition partner, the Nationals are rightly concerned about what the fuck is going on.

While many of them hold safe regional seats, and their personal incomes are likely guaranteed going into the next election, the possibility of governing looks slim.

We spoke to Micahel McCormack, the ambiguous looking leader of the Nationals about the line of questioning.

“We just want to know whether they are finished up with all this schoolyard bullshit? I mean fuck me, I’m not going to have to send my kids to the local public school or anything, but I don’t know, it’s going to quite boring just sitting in the opposition for the next few years,” McCormack said.

“So I, myself and the rest of the party would like to know that all the Libs have finished tossing up whose side they are, and running between each other offices like gossiping teenagers.”

Dutton Reconsiders Becoming PM After Reading Ex-Pat’s Threat To Never Come Home If He’s Leader

TEXT:

John-Michael Tanbar’s lips have been sealed to Berlin’s bosom for nearly a year now and he told The Advocate that he’s never been happier.

The German happy-go-lucky sensibilities and their blasé, liberal attitude toward pretty much everything was just what the 27-year-old ceramic artist was looking for.

But there was always a small part of him that longed to be home in Betoota Grove.

The droll chatter of lawnmowers by day, a home-cooked meal by night in front of the ABC’s evening programming – in a word – heaven.

“But no,” he said today.

Taking to social media this afternoon [local time], the fired-up Virgo declared that he wouldn’t come home if Peter Dutton, a mildly popular backbencher, became Australia’s 30th Prime Miniter.

“If Peter Dutton becomes PM I’m never coming home. The fucking cockroach… Apologies to any offended cockroaches.**”

The status has made waves within his own personal echo-chamber, with a number of people on his friend’s list either liking or commenting that they also support his viewpoint.

However, one unintended reader of Mr Tanbar’s status was Peter Dutton himself.

Upon seeing and digesting what young John-Michael wrote, Mr Dutton told our reporters that he’s now reconsidering a second leadership spill.

Speaking to The Advocate via a popular encrypted end-to-end messenger service, Mr Dutton said his ‘feelings have been hurt’.

“I mean, I want people to like me,” wrote Dutton.

“It hurts when young, inner-city lefties call me ‘Potato’ and ‘Nazi Cocksucker’. And not just that, when I see the future of this country, people like John-Michael say they’ll never come home if I’m the Prime Minister,”

“It makes me reconsider. Do I even want to be PM? I don’t even know anymore.”

The exchange ended with Mr Dutton’s office promising to stop sending unmarked envelopes of suspicious white powder to our South Betoota newsroom – as the families of the four receptionists who’ve since died from exposure to anthrax are demanding answers.

Punter Cuts To Chase And Handballs Tax Return Directly To Online Bookies

TEXT:

Sales representative and former crypto-enthusiast Chris Porter (28) recently cut out the middleman and donated his tax return directly to online bookies in a genius move set to maximise his time.

Receiving a tax return of $645, or roughly one and a half pairs of RM Williams, Porter opted to save the heartbreak of watching it slowly dwindle away and decided to make a non-refundable donation to his favourite betting app for the full amount of his return.

According to Porter, donating his tax return directly to betting app YouBetChat will save him the time and heartbreak of seeing his ‘bonus money’ dwindle to nothing in the lead up to footy finals.

“Haha let’s be honest, I was going to do something dumb like bet it on the Cowboys anyway!” joked Porter.

“Actually they won the other week didn’t they? Doesn’t matter.”

A colleague of Porter’s, Nolan Rice (30) is surprised that his mate forwent the equivalent of two bags of crappy Australian coke and a cocktail, but sees the logic in the plan.

“If he won anything by gambling it, which let’s agree, he wouldn’t, then he was just going to spend it on bags and drinks anyway. This way everyone wins,” stated Rice.

“Except for Chris, kind of.”

Feeling elated by his innovative donation to a $19 billion dollar industry, Porter is looking forward to saving time in other areas of his life in order to feel like the person he once was again.

“I think tomorrow I’m going to apologise to my girlfriend for getting her a thoughtless, last-minute Christmas present later this year.”

Directionless 30-Something Drifting Through Life Finds Work As A Life Coach

TEXT:

Former call centre employee Charlie Roper (32) has taken to social media to announce she is now accepting her first clients as a professional life coach, despite the fact she is the last person you’d ever take advice from.

As a high school graduate, Roper recently added to her credentials by attending a life coaching course that she paid for by taking out a small payday loan from a shopping plaza bank she is not yet indebted to.

Now with the necessary skills needed to be a home-brand therapist, Roper is ready to start changing people’s lives for the better even though she has never made much of an effort to improve her own situation.

“You need to listen to your heart but you can’t do that without a stethoscope. I am that stethoscope,” stated Roper as she packed away her overflowing ashtrays in order to make her lounge room more ‘client friendly.’

Visiting Family Members Choose To Ignore Huge Jug Of Piss Beside Grandpa’s Hospital Bed

TEXT:

After a recent fall, a local sexagenarian has found himself in Betoota Base Hospital with a broken coccyx and fractured humorous.

Murray Sockman was collecting his mail on Friday morning when he came across some ice slathered across his Betoota Heights driveway.

His late-model Hush Puppies, which advertised ‘extra grip’ on the box, were no match for the slick black ice beneath them.

“All of a sudden, I was sliding toward the road,” Murray told our reporters.

“My arms were whooshing and windmilling to keep balance – but it was too late.”

He fell backwards onto his rump and tried to cushion the fall with his right arm, ended up breaking both.

But as his hospital visit is looking more like a hospital stay, family members have been trickling in to see the broken-bummed Gemini in an attempt to cheer him up.

However, as his 17-year-old granddaughter, Lucy Sockman, told The Advocate just a short time ago – it was hard to ignore the huge jug of cold piss hanging off the end of his bed.

“Grandpa needs to drink some water,” she said.

“It really did stink, like my fucking eyes were watering from the ammonia. It was hard to ignore, especially when I know the other end of the pipe going into the jug is up his urethra,”

“But I chose to ignore it. I could’ve made fun of it and put the piss jug on my Insta story but I reckon it’d hurt his feelings. It’s pretty funny, now I think of it,”

“It really was the elephant in the room.”

Our reporter went back to ask Mr Sockman about the jug of piss hanging off the end of the bed and how his visitors might feel about it – but he’d just had his morphine topped up.

“I feel like I’m in a spa,” he said.

Boomers Welcome Grandchild Into World Who’ll Inevitably Die Because Of Their Environmental Vandalism

TEXT:

A semi-retired Betoota Grove couple welcomed their first grandchild into the world over the weekend and they’ve been doting on the little bundle of joy ever since.

Graham and Enola ‘Butter’ Rogers, both 68, took a break from manhandling their eldest son’s baby to speak to The Advocate about the joy pulsating throughout their bodies at the moment.

The couple spoke to The Advocate on the shared deck of their eldest child’s Betoota Ponds townhouse, which backs onto our reporter’s comically-appalling abode.

“Little Jessie was born at 3am on Sunday morning. 4125 grams! What a little cannonball!” said Graham.

“We’re just so happy,” added Butter.

“Our first grandchild. I’m and grandmother! We’ve been waiting an age for this. For Graham to settle down. He’s just put a deposit down and now he’s got the baby! Just fantastic.”

However, as the bubbly Butter ducked outside onto the deck for a bit of fresh air – provided by a delicious Red Rothman’s – she confided in our reporter regarding her fears for the future.

“The world is not the same as it was when I was having babies,” she said, coughing.

“You’ve got unchecked immigration, climate change, antibiotic resistance, the death of bees, permafrost defrosting, the ice caps melting, the list goes on,”

“I hope the next generation has what it takes to solve these problems. The future does feel me the dread! Not that it matters, to me. I’ll either be in the ground or on someone’s mantlepiece in 20 years or so.”

Graham then slid the flyscreen open to join our reporter and Butter out on the deck.

“They’ll be right, Butter. They’ll be able to fix it with computers. Don’t worry yourself like that. It’s not our problem,”

“We can only love our children and grandchildren as much as we love ourselves.”

The Forgotten Victims Of The Drought: This Brickie Has Had To Work Every Day For Three Years

TEXT:

“The drought affects a whole range of industries, not just agriculture,” he said.

“We might not make good television or sell newspapers with our stories of woe but let me tell you something for free. We brickies, builders and unskilled shit-kickers haven’t had a rain day in almost three years,”

“Do you know what that does to a man? What it does to a brickie’s soul? No, you wouldn’t.”

Speaking candidly to The Advocate this morning at the Betoota Height’s hi-vis takeaway institution, Helen’s Ventricle Blowout Canteen, Stevie Proctor said he longs for drought-breaking rain because he needs a day off badly.

The 33-year-old over-confident Leo did concede that if he did have a rain day, he’d probably waste it ripping cones and playing Star Wars Episode I: Pod Racer on his Nintendo 64 he won in a bet 12 years ago.

“But that’s heaven to me,” he said, wiping the Dare Iced Coffee milk moustache off his face with his bare forearm.

“What a brickie does with his rain day is between him and God. Speaking of God, if he’s reading this, get off your fucking cloud and give us some rain, you fucking idiot. People are doing their arse out here and you’re probably off pashing John Lennon or something fucking crook like that! Fuck!”

Helen called out Stevie’s order number and he paid for his works burger and sausage roll with a fistful of coins.

“It’s fucked,” he said.

Selfish, Insignificant, Low-Paid Employee Hands In Her Two Weeks Right When It’s Getting Busy

TEXT:

A low-tier employee barely making the minimum wage has decided to make it all about her and inconvenience her boss today, by handing in her resignation.

Pip Husic, a client manager at a mid-sized Public Relations Agency in the French Quarter explained to The Advocate that she was just feeling like a change of scene.

After plugging away for 18 months at the trendy firm, Husic accepted a role as a Communications Manager in the government sector and decided to take a holiday before starting the new job.

While Husic is feeling relieved about the transition, the Agency Director had something else to say.

“Jesus she’s got some fucking nerve doesn’t she?” the Director, Ashley Witten said to us today.

“We have a stack of briefs to turn over and clients to manage in the next little while and she’s decided to pull the pin. Who does she think she is? If we can’t get some other chump in quickly some of the work might fall upon my desk, and I’ll have to filter it back out to the others,” Witten said.

“Frustrating.”

Andrew Orton a similarly insignificant colleague of Husic told The Advocate that her departure has fucked him around as well.

“I’m going to end up doing all of the shit she would have done if she was here. It will all be drip fed to me as if I’ve got no idea what’s going on. I might quit too.”

In a special 30th birthday celebration next year, the team at Bluesfest have announced that they will be holding the annual event at Bunnings Warehouse in Mermaid Waters.

The Easter celebration will see Bluesfest team up with Bunnings, along with Sportsbet, Crown Lager and Kirks’ Solo to host a bucks style celebration.

Festival boss, Peter Noble (sic), texted his mates Benji Harper, Big Jack Johnson, Richo Clapton and Tommy ‘Fingers’ Emmanuel, who never miss the boys weekender.

They’ll be bringing their acoustics with them too, so you can expect a few classics by the wood heater section.

Over at the power tools, you’ll be able to catch Russell Morris, “Perko” Perkins and Men At Work’s Colin Hay, which will be sure to leave you fanging for a snag out the front.

If these names don’t already scream The Blues, Peter has also arranged for a complimentary pork pie hat and a photo with Julia Zemiro upon entry, “for that real post-slavery Clarksdale vibe”.

We asked Pistol Pete about his decision.

“It was a no-brainer. The snags. The ample parking. The short distance from BCF”.

There was some uproar amongst some groups, though, as the first lineup announcement was lacking in acts which feature Micheal Franti doing yoga.

Man Transitions Seamlessly Into Fatherhood By Not Rubbing In His Sunscreen

TEXT:

A local paddle boarder has this week made a seamless transition into his role as a father, by applying about 5 times more sunscreen than is necessary and not making any reasonable attempt to rub it into his skin.

After a few double-takes, Trevor Hendy, a senior town-planner and avid Rodriguez fan, was spotted during his metamorphosis at Betoota Heads on Sunday morning with a 2.5L pump bottle of 50+.

Hendy was seen to be relishing in his new regime, which comprises of a 2km paddle around the manmade beach at Pattersons Dam, before strapping his 3-month old daughter to his chest and joining his wife and bulldog at the Beachside Farmers Markets.

“It was a very natural transition” Hendy admitted.

“Before fatherhood, I spent a deal of time on the application and focused on efficiency an even consistency. Where as now, I feel at complete ease of looking and feeling like a seagull shat all over my face. It’s a beautiful thing”

As he made his final declaration to The Betoota Advocate, we know that under all of that Banana Boat, his face would have shone with a sense of contentment and accomplishment.

“I feel I’ve completed now, the evolution. Like a beautiful albino butterfly emerging from it’s cocoon, a boy in the bachelor market, to a man in the property market”.

“Fuuuuuck it’s in my eyes it stings fuck fuck fuck”

Wealthy Older Man Begins Wearing Round Spectacles In Declaration Of His Left-Wing Views

TEXT:

For Ross Wylett (68), maintaining progressive political views is much harder than it is for most bleeding heart lefties.

For one, he’s made a lot of money out of the workers.

And two, he’s a rich old white man who lives in a suburb that puts fairy lights in the trees for no reason.

After a fruitful career as a manufacturer of fibreglass ceiling tiles, the retired Betoota Grove-based grandfather of four found himself often having to preface any long lunch with the fact that he votes for the Australian Greens and believes that refugees are humans.

“I know I get called a hypocrite for my environmentalist views” he says.

“What with all of the land fill I’ve been responsible for… But still, it doesn’t mean I don’t care about maintaining a future for the Great Barrier Reef”

Ross says after a lifetime of discreetly donating money to Indigenous charities and organising lunches with Labor politicians and Kerry Packer – his extensive art collection just wasn’t giving enough hints to the fact that he thinks Alan Jones should have been jailed for the part he played in inciting the Cronulla Riots.

In fact, so uncommon is it for a man of his age and tax bracket to give a fuck about public housing, that Mr Wylett has had to start wearing rounded spectacles – in an effort to identify himself as a baby boomer leftie.

“It’s really cut down how often I find myself having to defend the Sudanese-Australian community at the golf club” he says.

“People just see the spectacles and decide to talk to me about the #MeToo movement’s affect on Australian theatre”

Small Town Accountant Smashes Stereotypes And Seeks Pre-Selection For The Nationals

TEXT:

A mildly-popular Selwyn accountant has taken the next logical step in his career and has taken the necessary steps to seek pre-selection for The Nationals in the federal seat of Kennedy in Central Queensland.

Though it’s been held by Bob Katter since 1993, local small business owner Graham-Albert Stevensonson feels he is in with a red-hot shot of toppling the Conclurry-born politician.

The town of Selwyn, some 700-odd kilometres north of the Desert Republic of Betoota, has been serviced by Stevensonson’s chartered accountancy firm for over 20 years – but he feels federal politics is his true calling.

“My eldest is ready to take the reigns at G A Stevensonsons & Sons – which leaves me at a loose end,” said Stevensonson.

“And I hope to tie that loose end up in Canberra at the next federal election. I’m hoping to gain preselection for The Nationals up here in Kennedy. I understand the challenge of dethrowning Bob Katter. The people of Kennedy love him,”

“But need I remind you of what happened to John Howard. As a small town accountant, I’ve gained an intimate knowledge of everything from cotton farming to ice dealing. I’m the perfect candidate if you ask me.”

The Advocate reached out to Nationals leader Michael McCormack for comment and received a relatively prompt and somewhat articulate response.

“We’ve promised it so somebody’s son so no, Mr Stevensonson will have to either get a prominent father or wait in line behind all the other directionless 50-something white men kicking dirt clots around sale yards from Kyneton to Kununurra.”

Study Finds 90% Of Bahn Mi Chilli Is Confined To The Final Bite

TEXT:

The team from one of the nation’s peak scientific bodies had today handed down their findings in a recent landmark study into the concentration and location of chilli within a Vietnamese pork roll.

And what the study has uncovered will send a shiver down your spine.

Speaking candidly to the media today with the type of blase attitude which invented WiFi and the Hendra virus vaccine, CSIRO spokesperson Deven Frisco said that his team discovered that basically all chilli within a Bahn Mi is confined to the last bite.

“Beleive it or not,” he said.

“Over the past year or so, a whole lot of researchers and scientists here at the Canberra labs have been smashing the pork rolls from the bakery downstairs. Glenn from the weaponised bees department basically lives off the things,”

“Anyway, 9 in 10 pork rolls our staff consumed had no chilli in them – except for the final mouthful. So the sting lingers long after the rich, complex arrangement of flavours is gone. That’s 90%, so we drafted up a report and released it. You’re welcome. You should see the new $20 banknotes, too. They are shit hot. If you’re able to counterfeit them, I doff my cap to you, criminal.”

The news has been met, however, with contempt from the South Betoota Vietnamese community, who say putting an ungodly amount of chilli at the end of the roll is the norm.

Annie Vo, owner-operator of the Shirley Temple Bakery on Daroo Street, said that customers who ask for chilli should be prepared for chilli – and to not complain when they come across chilli in their Bahn Mi.

“This is why I ask,” she said.

“Why in Blue Christ would the federal scientific research agency waste their fucking time on something like this? I mean, what in good fuck is wrong with you people?”

“You know you can open the sandwich up and look at it if you want? Or you can not have chilli if it’s going to blow your dumb fucking First Fleet head off. Anyway, my Bahn Mi are $3 a pop. Try beat that for lunch.”

Defeated Vegetarian Forced To Pick The Meat Off 3AM Slice Of Pizza

TEXT:

Her friends laughed when Miriam Blake said she wanted a Margherita.

Saying she’d a vegetarian was obviously a bridge too far, even as the kick-on wound down at the Betoota Heights sharehouse she and four other friends live in.

Everyone, including Ms Blake, was starving.

That’s according to Lucy Camberfield, who did the ordering the old-fashioned way by telephoning the James Dean Pizzaera in the French Quarter.

“I got barbecue meat lovers, a supreme, two bottles of full-strength Pepsi and two logs of garlic bread,” she told our reporter.

“We understand that Miriam doesn’t eat meat. She hasn’t for weeks. But ordering a whole meatless pizza at 3AM after a big night on the tiles just because someone is a vegetarian isn’t really fair on the rest of us,”

“Vegetarians have to sleep in the bed they made themselves.”

But Miriam told The Advocate that she was under the impression that a vegetariab option had been ordered and upon the food’s arrival at the house – it began to sink in that she was ‘probably going to go to bed hungry’.

That’s if she didn’t just pick the meat off.

“So I did just that,” she said.

“It was still technically vegetarian because I didn’t eat meat, but the whole thing was dripping with animal fats from the pepperonis and whatnot,”

“I did what I had to do. If you don’t eat meat on purpose, it’s basically OK. There might’ve been a bacon bit slip past me but it wasn’t like I was eating a stick of processed meat.”

Uncle Who Jokes About Never Getting Married Sounds Like He Actually Needs A Hug

TEXT:

Researchers are speculating possible distress signals emanating from part-time mechanic and fulltime uncle, Brian Murphy (51) as he continues to joke to anyone who will listen about why you should never get married.

Friends of Murphy state the almost-loveable larikin is never short of a few words, particularly about his ‘ex-missus’ who he never seems to want to talk about but usually does whenever he’s had a bevvy or two.

“Kids, I’ll give you some advice,” stated Murphy.

“Never get married.”

Although Murphy was noted to joke about marriage prior to and during his five-year marriage with ex-wife Linda Hayward, witnesses have noted his tone has shifted and speculated that maybe all he really wants is a hug and someone to talk to.

Those close to Murphy state his remarks about the institution of marriage have decreasingly been followed by his booming laughter and are more likely to be accompanied by a grave stare and a smile weaker than his white tea with four sugars.

Experts hypothesise his decreased gusto could be a sign that jokes about his failed marriage are actually a cry for help and his way of dealing with emotional torment due to being raised before men were allowed to have emotions.

“Seriously. Never get married. Don’t mate. Don’t.”

Recent interest in Uncle Brian’s behaviour has grown as the casual misogynist and often racist uncle has announced tentative plans to fill the gaping hole in his heart with state politics.

“You need someone who looks like they know how to fight and know how to root. And that’s me.”

Sad uncles everywhere are encouraged to seek help and are encouraged to have emotional conversations with their family that aren’t connected to their footy teams poor performance.

Agency Forces Team To Get Corporate Headshots In Final Act Of Humiliation

TEXT:

An office-wide memo at Betoota advertising agency Co-United Creative Klan has sent low-level employees into panic mode as the CEO has announced corporate headshots will be taking place in what many are calling the final act of humiliation.

The 9,000-word email briefly outlined to the 8 am to 7 pm workers the importance of ‘looking fresh’ and ‘dressing spesh [sic]’ ahead of the headshot photoshoot which could only take place on Friday evening which will be compensated by mandatory office pizza and drinks afterwards.

An excerpt from the email by CEO Anton Slater stated:

“Be sure to bring your A game AF cause these bad boiz (and girlz) are gonna say who TF we are when we roll in for our big pitch for Sunkist!!”

Insider sources have confirmed Slater is referring to an awareness campaign they are pitching to soft drink brand Sunkist, a drink that is beloved in all Australian households that couldn’t find Fanta when they were at the shops.

Agency creatives state without the headshots, it is humiliating enough to have to pretend to give a shit about the sickly, orange bottles of crap in front of the soul-less corporate snuffboxes they must affectionately refer to as their clients.

Junior copywriter Aaron Loxton stated Slater denied his request to use a preexisting professional headshot he had taken by a photographer friend in his backyard on an iPhone 8.

“I wouldn’t normally be so resistant but he [Slater] said there are going to be props,” stated Loxton as he shakily lit a fresh cigarette with a burning butt.

The headshots in question are to also appear on the ‘About Us’ section of the company website as if humanising the people who work there is going to marketers to part with their understocked supply of cash.

Reports state one creative is tentatively writing a suicide note that the client has kindly asked if they can send over first just so they can rework the copy a bit.

Betoota’s ‘Polo In The Outback’ Festival Moved To Quilpie After Recent Rain Turns Field Green

TEXT:

The mid-winter rains the town received late last month has claimed another victim today after the president of the Betoota Heights Polo Club announced the upcoming Polo in the Outback Festival is being moved to Quilpie because the local polo fields have turned ‘too green’.

Speaking to local media this morning, BHPC President Lucas Conbar-Delga, explained that the green pasture regrowth on the town’s polo fields no longer fits the aesthetic of outback polo.

“You can’t have an Outback Polo Festival on a green paddock, can you?” he asked journalists.

“So we’ve been in touch with the Quilpie Diggers Race Club, where it hasn’t rained since 1947, and they’ve been kind enough to agree to host the festival this year. We’ve had a few calls this morning about tickets; if you’ve already purchased a ticket to the event, you will be able to use it at Quilpie,”

“Just to reiterate, the upcoming Polo in the Outback Festival from the 17th-19th of this month is now at Quilpie, not Betoota Heights. I hope to see you all there.”

The Festival has attracted some of the biggest names in professional and amateur polo from around the world.

One notable attendee is said to be fabled Argentinian polocrosse coach, Roberto Teaguello, who is rumoured to be scouting players for the world-renowned Everybody vs The Whites Polo-A-Thon in the NSW Hunter Valley later this year.

Liaising With Dealers Now The Sole Reason Why Snapchat Is Still Installed On Local Man’s Phone

TEXT:

Taking time out of his busy Tuesday afternoon yesterday, a plain-clothed legal professional confided in The Advocate at a popular local pub’s beer garden, that the only reason he still has Snapchat installed on his phone is that it’s become the amateur drug dealer’s preferred method of communication.

Gavin Pooley, who said that wasn’t his real name because he doesn’t want to get disbarred, said that the image messaging app was once one of his most-loved – but has since been replaced by something less complicated and more practical.

“But yeah,” he said.

“My cap dealer only uses Snapchat because it deletes messages after you send them. There are ways around it, I know, but yeah. I would’ve deleted it ages ago, you know? The only ‘snaps’ I get sent these days are from Team Snapchat,”

“You know he’s not a professional because we’re using Snapchat. You still have to use Wickr to get Class A’s and weed funnily enough. Caps must be a Gen Z thing, hey?”

However, The Advocate reached out to a number of local drug dealers and their opinion’s of the once-popular app are much different from that of young Mr Pooley’s.

Choosing wisely not to share his real name, a mildly-unpopular local cocaine dealer explained in detail just why using Snapchat isn’t as anonymous as people think.

“Brus,” he preffixed.

“It’s not encrypted. Don’t put anything on Snapchat you wouldn’t want your Mum to see, friend. Now do you want a Bilbo Baggins or not? Hurry up and get out of my car. You’re not Bryan Fletcher, c–t. I’m not going to stitch you up.”

Grown Man Justifies Financially-Reckless Purchase By Calling It A ‘Toy’

TEXT:

On top of Simon Pooley’s wardrobe, half full of $300 polyester suits and almost all of Uniqlo’s winter range, sits a drone.

The mildly-unpopular French Quarter accountant has no need for one – but that didn’t stop him buying one.

Each morning and indeed, every afternoon, he catches the D45 from Betoota Heights to and from work. In an effort to foster equality, he doesn’t offer his seat to women.

He listens to podcasts about entrepreneurship and innovation, which fuels his dreams of one day cutting the paid-by-the-month umbilical cord and braving the rough, high sea of self-employment.

But aside from that, his recent purchase of a drone was made possible by the 29-year-old robot calling it a ‘toy’.

Speaking candidly to The Advocate while he flew the drone this morning before work in Machattie Park, Pooley admitted that he didn’t need a drone – he just wanted one.

“As a member of the aspirational, salary-earning middle class, I’m able to make purchases such as the drone and justify it but saying I just needed it,” he said.

“While somebody like my own father, a red-faced bourgeois Baby Boomer, this purchase would seem financially reckless as it amounts to well over a week’s pay for me. Well, his generation has other things to entertain them, like having unprotected sex at an outdoor Led Zeppelin concert,”

“All their songs are about fucking! Anyway, they could afford property, education and travel. I can only afford room, board, insurance and things that take my mind off the sea of abject misery that is life as a Millennial. Honestly, this drone is keeping the shotgun out of my mouth in more ways than one. Now can you leave me alone? I want to film the top of this tree and some other things around the park.”

Simon then flew his drone north up the Pond track with him following closely behind underneath.

Elderly Greek Neighbour Has A Bachelor Son About Your Age, Or Maybe Like 20 Years Older

A local Betoota woman has found herself almost single enough to follow up on her elderly Greek neighbour’s non-stop offers to bring her son over for a visit.

24-year-old Anna Berry has been single for almost 18 months now, and after an entire winter not sharing a bed with anyone, is actually considering a blind date with the old Yaiyai’s 39-year-old son.

Elleni (71) says that her son is perfect for Anna, and they are about the same age, thereabouts.

“You know I have a son” says Elleni, for the 67th time since Anna moved in next door four months ago.

“I want you for my son”

While Elleni has all but surrendered the idea of her cafe-owner son meeting a nice Greek girl, the idea of orchestrating a relationship herself seems to be almost as good.

“You have no husband?” she asks, again.

“No Elleni” says Anna.

“I don’t…”

However, the part of the conversation that would usually end up with both the neighbours laughing this half-serious offer doesnt arise today, as Anna is actually considering it.

After taking a few minutes to ponder, Anna returns.

“What does he do for fun?” she asks.

Elleni is quick to point out that he loves to go dancing at that big street party they have in Sydney, and maybe she should go down with him next February.

Junior Lawyers Enter Day 23 Of Heated Who’ll Leave Work First Stand-Off

TEXT:

As the clock struck midnight last night, the lights were still on at Oakbridge Carter & Webster and four young lawyers were sat at their desks – each waiting for another to leave first.

As it is every night of the week.

The firm’s website indicates office hours are 9am to 6pm but staff are often there well before and well after that.

But for the firm’s youngest and brightest, it’s often much, much longer.

Speaking to our reporter on the roof of Remienko House on Daroo Street (where Oakbridge Carter & Webster and The Advocate both lease office space), one of the youngest on staff at the firm explained that she’s been locked in a battle with three other young lawyers over who’ll leave the office first.

For the past 23 days.

The corporate legal professional, who asked to remain anonymous, said she hopes the standoff will end soon.

“I came to work one morning in September and I haven’t been home since,” she said.

“For the past three weeks, I’ve been sleeping under my desk and washing my only set of clothes at night time in the kitchenette dishwasher. But so have the others. I hope the partners realise this. I hope to be one by the time I’m 29,”

“But yeah. It’s common knowledge that if you’re a lawyer under 25 and you go home before 8pm, your bosses will think you’re lazy. And guess what happens when your bosses think you’re lazy? They pigeonhole you into property law and force you to play on the inter-firm mixed touch team,”

“I’d rather have children than do that.”

The polite young solicitor then lit another cigarette with the butt of the last one she had, explaining that the others had gone to get food so she had time.

There was a time when George Washbrook cared about the environment – but then he became a small businessman.

From that small business, he was able to buy property. Which he then leveraged to buy more property.

Now the successful 68-year-old semi-retired trader is able to live a nice, pleasant life in a house he owns in a suburb with a ‘0’ as the second number.

“So I can keep up to date with my children who’ve since moved abroad. It’s a great modern development, I’d be at the mercy of the wife to show me if they hadn’t created an account for me before they left,”

“But I’ve also discovered it to be quite an educational tool.”

Speaking to The Advocate via wireless telephone from a mid-century Danish recliner in the rumpus room of his modest 6-bedroom Betoota Grove Federation-era homestead, Washbrook said Facebook has taught him new things on topics such as climate change, single-use plastics and immigration.

Sasha Baron Cohen Tricks Most Of Australia Into Thinking His New Show Is On Netflix

“Where the fuck is it?” he wrote.

“There’s no Sacha Baron Cohen movies on here. Do you have a torrent?”

Nobody on Darcy Pegmann’s group chat had a torrent because piracy is bad and only people who download cars do it – but one friend did offer to point him in the right direction.

Late last night, on the recommendation of more than one mate he values the opinion of, the 25-year-old found time before he drifted off to sleep to watch Who Is America? 

But as he came to learn, it’s only available on a streaming service called Stan – which he tells The Advocate is an Australian-owned alternative to the faceless US giant.

“Fucks sake,” he said to himself, tapping a credit card number into his comically-heavy seven-year-old MacBook Pro.

“This better be worth it.”

And worth, says the frugal Libra, it was.

Speaking candidly to The Advocate this evening on the D45 bus back up the hill to Betoota Heights, Pegmann said the fun didn’t end after Sacha Baron Cohen did.

“I ended up going downstairs and having a beug [a water pipe shot of cannibis] with my housemate Phil and then I went back upstairs and ended up watching Bend It Like Beckham off my tree, which was great,” he said.

“Then after that, mind you it was pretty late, I greened out later watching Paperback Hero. You know that old Australian movie with a young Hugh Jackman and Claudia Karven? If there’s a better snapshot of Australia in 1999, I don’t want to hear about it.”

However, Darcy was on the fence about keeping or cancelling his subscription after the free 30-day period expired – but ultimately conceded that he’d probably forget about it and just keep it.

Local Bong Head’s Flatmate Uncovers Hidden Cache Of Long-Lost Scissors

TEXT:

Not a unique problem but problematic none-the-less.

A cache of long-forgotten household scissors has been found close to where a resident of a Betoota Heights sharehouse keeps his bong and other drug paraphernalia.

Speaking exclusively to The Advocate about the discovery, Duncan Boyd (the housemate who claims to have uncovered the stash) said that he simply channelled his inner Adrian Monk after going to the second-from-the-top kitchen draw to discover that another pair of scissors had gone walkabout.

“I couldn’t believe it’d happened again. I needed to free a padlock from its packaging. I’ll tell you what, I’ve actually had to get a lockable toolbox for the fridge to keep my soft-cheeses safe but that’s a story for another time,” said the 24-year-old.

“So I decided to put my mind to it. Why were these things going missing? I couldn’t understand for the life of me why it kept on happening. Then last night, just as I said goodnight to Liam, I heard the unmistakable clip-snipping of stainless steel on porcelain,”

“Then it hit me like a freight train. Fucking Liam was using them to chop up his fucking lung beers.”

Boyd then explained what happened next.

He told our reporter he burst into Liam’s room without knocking and confronted him about the scissors, to which the ‘droopy-eyed fuck’ laughed nonchalantly and opened his draw.

“There they all were. About seven fucking pairs. Even my nail scissors! I’ve been using my Old Timer on my toenails since fucking September! As angry as I was, it was basically neutralised by the joy and relief of finally getting to the bottom of it,” he said.

“Seriously, I thought he was gaslighting me at one point. I took the pair I most recently purchased and told him he could keep the rest. If he took my pair again, I’d cut his hair off in his sleep.”

Liam then said he’d lie in bed until it grew back.

“It’s School Holidays” Says Moron In Need Of Something To Blame Their Lateness On

TEXT:

Gregor Redpath is one of the leading examples of why the media and old people have it in for Millennials.

He has no savings.

Most of the time, especially in the seven days following payday, the 24-year-old lives beyond his means.

When he cracks his iPhone screen, he just AfterPays another one. He even AfterPays his clothes because he wants them now, not later.

“Make houses in nice areas cheaper so I can buy one on an entry level banking salary – because I deserve what my parents have now”, is one of his favourite catchcries.

However, today there’s another reason why his Baby Boomer boss hates this moron.

Twenty minutes late to work, he was called into the managers office where he was forced to explain himself.

“I got stuck in traffic,” he said.

“You know, school holidays and everything.”

His boss pursed his lips then sighed.

After explaining to young Gregor that he’s got two adult children now and has navigated school holidays as both a parent and a professional, he didn’t empathise with his problem.

“I don’t care if it’s school holidays, Redpath,”

“This is your second strike. As per your employment contract, which has been ratified by the Bankers Union of South West Queensland, if you’re late again, I get to flog you about the torso with a cricket stump.”

Gregor sank back in his chair.

He’d seen other, more useless employees receive a public stumping before and it wasn’t something he’d be keen on trying out.

“I’m sorry, sir. I’ll try to be early tomorrow to make up for it. I might even stay late today.”

His both had already stopped listening so Gregor showed himself out.

Local Intellectual Says ‘Hence’

TEXT:

A local Real Estate Agent has put her intellectual prowess on full display today by using a relatively uncommon word in conversation.

The Residential Leasing Agent at Ray Hooker in Betoota’s CBD dropped the word ‘hence’ into the conversation while taking a couple through a house inspection.

Alice Woodburn (32) was walking some potential tenants through a reasonably large 3 bedder in the Golf Course Estate on the outskirts of town, when she thought she might put on a little bit of vocal razzmatazz so to speak.

“So, you’ll see here that the master bedroom has a really nice ensuite, hence the asking price of $450 a week from the owners,” she said today.

We asked Woodburn why she decided to lay it on the couple looking for a place.

“I sorta (sic) like to throw words in like that during walkthroughs, just to show that I’m not your run of the mill Real Estate Agent you know,” she said.

“Not just someone who opens doors for commission.”

Woodburn than explained that it doesn’t stop with just hence.

“Therefore, whilst, accordingly.”

“Those are a couple of other words I like to regale potential tenants with,” Woodburn said.

Workman then told us she was ‘absolutely flat out at the moment’ and had to get back to the office and ‘get her nose to the grindstone (sic).’

Friends Channel Their Inner Thai Navy Seal To Get House Guest In A K-Hole Off Floor And Into Bed

TEXT:

In what’s being described as an absolute miracle, a rag-tag team of Betoota Heights housemates has last night banded together to get a comatose house guest off the living room floor and into a bed.

Things got out of hand at the notorious Highview Road sharehouse, which has been handed down from generation to generation for upwards of a decade, to the point where a reveller at the impromptu gathering decided some ketamine would take it to another level.

And to another level, it did take it.

With a croaky, hoarse voice this morning, one of the residents described last night’s scenes to The Advocate via wireless telephone.

“Yeah, the ketamine really separated the wheat from the chaff last night,” said Millie Bloom, a 21-year-old veterinary student at South Betoota Polytechnic College.

“People either got up and started pacing around the room, rubbing their hands up and down their duck-down jackets. But everyone went real quiet. The K was the captain now,”

“Or they went down into a deep K-pit. Especially Cambo’s mate, Lindsay. I think that was his name. Like 30 seconds after he railed a hearty slug off my Mum’s old coffee table, his eyes rolled back in his head and he flat out started speaking in tongues,”

“His pale corpse slithered off the couch, landing face down on the rug where just started vomiting, which killed the mood somewhat. Me and a few other experienced K-Kowboys who were there put him in the recovery position and scooped the gunk out of his mouth and nose. Cleared his airway and did all that shit.”

But that wasn’t the end of the drama, according to another housemate who was present at the scene.

Douglas Handley, a 23-year-old media student also at South Betoota Polytechnic, spoke to our reporters this morning and he said it was clear Lindsay needed the healing powers of a mattress – the floor wasn’t doing him any good.

“He was in a bad way. There’s K-holes and then there are K-Caves. Lindsay was deep within a cavernous K-Cave and he needed to be rescued. So we came up with a plan.”

Channelling their inner Thai Navy Seal, the elite assembly of men who saved a Thai soccer team trapped within a flooded cave earlier this week, the group of mates picked Lindsay up off the living room floor and carried him gently into Cambo’s bed.

“It was a delicate operation. We bumped his head into a few walls and scraped his back along to the top of a dining chair but we got him out,” said Douglas.

“We couldn’t have done it if he were just super maggot. We needed the special powers of ketamine. People call us heroes but the real best on field last night was the K.”

The Advocate reached out to Lindsay for comment but are yet to receive a reply.

“Normal” Christian Lets Out A Smug Chuckle While Watching Book Of Mormon

TEXT:

A ‘normal’ follower of the teachings of Jesus Christ has spoken to The Advocate today about his experience watching the Book of Mormon last night.

The acclaimed musical which is now one of the most successful of all time, came to town last night as the stars took over the Royal Betoota Lyric Hall.

Nathaniel Wilson (35), who describes himself to non-Christians as one of the ‘normal ones’ said he decided to attend the musical last night to laugh at the ‘other freakazoids.’

Wilson was referring to the Church of Latter-day Saints, or Mormons as they are more commonly known, who, as the title suggests, feature heavily in the musical.

The Book of Mormon follows the paths of two Mormon missionaries who head to Uganda to preach the religion.

It’s is a musical comedy created by the people behind the famous animated comedy South Park.

Wilson a school teacher and father of 4 (a minimum amount of children any devout Christian should have) told our reporters last night that the musical was very funny.

“Look there were some unsavoury parts, but all in all I will cop that if it means I can laugh at those door-knocking weirdos,” he laughed.

“You want me to give it a one-line review?! The musical was so good it almost had me speaking in tongues!” Wilson said to our reporters.

Local Child Develops Gluten Intolerance After Jumping On Safety Trampoline

TEXT:

A Betoota Heights child has developed an intolerance to popular food building-block, gluten, this afternoon just moments after he stepped off his bed-wetting cousin’s safety trampoline.

For 5-year-old Danny Taylor, his days of eating shit food are now over and his parents say they’ll have to start grocery shopping in Betoota Grove, where gluten was outlawed by local council in 2013.

“It’s such a shame,” said his mother, Bucket Beug-Taylor.

“He loved eating pizza. Now we have to get the smelly gluten-free bases that taste like a wet tea bag. His father, Jereignium, who also moonlights as my husband, even put his fist through the wall. Danny gets his love of gluten from his father, which is why I think he blames himself for this,”

“We avoided getting Danny one of those three-wheeled scooters that all those rich pussies ride in Betoota Grove. We took so many precautions to make sure he wouldn’t become gluten intolerant.”

A spokesman from Betoota Heights Fire And Ambulance said that the offending safety trampoline will be destroyed – and the owners of it fined and lashed with a good length of dog chain until they start seeing dead relatives.

Owner Of Bright Pink Toyota Yaris To Someday Learn What Resell Value Means

TEXT:

A popular local hairdresser has revealed he’s smitten with his new Toyota Yaris.

The man in question, a confused Gary Tuckwell answered the phone this and fielded questions regarding his new car from The Advocate – most of which were geared to his knowledge of resell value.

“What does that mean? Why is me owning a pink car newsworthy? Will people even read this gibberish? Did you have too much to drink watching State of Origin last night? Has your brain turned to mush?” he asked, in his outside voice.

Our reporter said nothing; then asked if he knew what resell value meant to him.

“I don’t know what you mean by that,” said Tuckwell.

Again, our reporter said nothing but this time he elected to hang up before the scissorman had a chance to give him another tongue lashing.

Parts of what Gary had yelled at our reporter rang true, however.

This story will be posted from The Advocate’s designated smoking hammock in Machattie Park sometime this afternoon.

Just when he thought it was over, Gary rang back on the wireless telephone.

“Does resell value mean that because I bought a new factory-pink Yaris, it will limit the market I have when I go to sell it to make up the balloon payment?”

“Shit, I didn’t think of it like that. So only other hairdressers and kin identifying as female will only be interested in buying my car at full room and board?”

“Actually, that doesn’t matter. Worse comes to worse, I’ll take it out to Betoota Ponds and torch the fucking thing for the insurance. Allianz still thinks it’s worth as much as what I paid for it.”

Dad Wraps Up Extremely Controversial Comment By Saying “Just Quietly”

A casual conversation with dad has resulted in him offering up a wildly sensitive bit of information about a prominent member of the community.

Even though it’s pretty clear that dad was told to keep this a secret, he thought that this passing bit of chit chat is probably the best time to offer it up.

While chatting about a local Betoota politician and family friend, Peter, who is now under investigation by the Crime and Corruption Commission for misusing tax-payer dollars to fund his holiday travel – dad sees no reason why he shouldn’t start talking about the whispers he’s heard about Peter’s traumatic childhood.

The conversation, which up until now has focused on how Peter’s had a bad run with the divorce a couple years back and how all this drama is getting in the way of him actually being a half decent local councillor, takes a dramatic turn as dad starts popping off with some shit that could easily result in a defamation suit if it was proven to be incorrect.

“Yeah, poor old Peter” says dad.

“He doesn’t make life easy for himself”

“To be honest, I think it’s got a lot to do with the fact that he got touched up by one of the brothers back at boarding school”

City Worker’s Gym Session Reaches New Level Of Intensity As Shuffle Chooses ‘Guerilla Radio’

Harking back to the days when he’d slam his Betoota Grove bedroom door shut and retreat into his headphones after an argument with his surgeon father, a local accountant has used that pent-up rage from yesteryear to smash out a bonus set this morning at the gym.

Dale Rodgers, who ended up in accounting because he is unable to mesh with the rest of society, said his upper-middle-class upbringing among the towering London Plane trees of Greenpoint Road left him feeling frustrated – but he found solace in Rage Against The Machine.

In particular, a track from their seminal classic album ‘The Battle Of Los Angles’.

Our reporter caught up with the jacked unit at the Subway next door to the PowerJuice Gym in the French Quarter.

He shuddered and gagged as our reporter ordered a toasted seafood surprise on white bread with Old English on top. Dale ordered a turkey 6-inch to go with his lack of personality.

“When Guerilla Radio came on in my headphones this morning at the gym, I went into beast mode. That’s my pump-up anthem to the max!”

“Such nostalgia in that track, I hadn’t heard it for so long. I’d just slogged through two sets listening to Moondance by the Irish Elvis, which really took the lead out of my pencil. Don’t get me wrong, I love me some Belfast Cowboy – just not now when I’m trying to enter beast mode,”

“Then that unmistakeable Morello riff came on and I felt a surge of power! Ohhh yeaah!”

Dale then shoved our reporter in a jovial but firm manner.

Not knowing what to do, he left the gym and locked himself in the Ford Capri he borrowed off The Advocate‘s editor Clancy Overell.

Daredevil Visits America Without Travel Insurance

TEXT:

A reckless young man hellbent of taking a multitude of unnecessary risks has just checked in with The Advocate this morning while enjoying his North American Odyssey.

Peter Songgrid, of Betoota Heights, also said he thought travel insurance was unessecary.

“There’s no point in living if you can feel alive,” he said, pawning it off as something he just made up on the spot.

“Yeah look, I just wanted to keep the costs down. I’ve been here for three weeks and nothing bad has happened to me yet. It’s not like I’m skiing or anything. There’s no snow so I’ve been downhill mountain bike riding in Yosemite and shit,”

“I could honestly live here. The lifestyle is so good. We’re only a couple hours from some of the best beaches in California. We went cliff diving at Big Sur on Friday night. It’s really different to cliff diving in the day time.”

In the land where even a short hospital visit can cost as much as a small apartment in Betoota Lakes, every travel advisory board recommends taking travel insurance out – even when travelling domestically.

However, that compounds when travelling to late-stage capitalist third world nations such as America.

Speaking to The Advocate this morning, Wendy Collins of Collins & Jones Travel in the French Quarter, said that visiting the United States without travel insurance is ‘extremely reckless’ and ‘possibly catastrophic’ both financially and emotionally.

“We’ve all heard the horror stories,” she said.

“Of folk being in hospital in America receiving enormous, life-altering medical bills. If Mr Songgrid is reading this, it’s still not too late to take out some cover. Please, for the love of Christ, please take out some insurance,”

“Fuck, I’ll even do it for you. Email me your details. There’s no point in doing what you’re doing.”

At the time of print, Peter said he has no plans to take out travel insurance because, despite the risks, bad things only happen to other people.

Long-Forgotten Coffee Machine At The End Of Local Bar Getting Most Use Since Last July

Bought during the expresso [sic] martini craze early last year, the coffee machine at the Cashew & Pogostick Hotel in Betoota Heights has been getting a work out recently – the most use it’s had since last July, says publican Jackie Stephens.

“So much so, we ran out of coffee cups last night and had to use pots. We had a group of young fellas come in from the soccer club to watch the big England game last night and they were ordering pint after pint of long black,” he told our reporter.

“We didn’t even know what to charge for such a drink. We offered to spice it up with a bit of Jameson’s or Bundy but the charmingly-weak-chinned Englishmen politely declined,”

“I guess this might have something to do with all those self-loathing, defeatist people who do Dry July.”

The popular publican said in all the years he’s been trapped in the hellish quagmire of wage theft and zero-job-security that is working in hospitality, he’s never seen such a large quantity of cheap java go over a bar.

“You know most of the time when folk order an espresso martini here, we just use two teaspoons of International Roast, two shots of Comrade vodka and top it up with salt water from the Big Blue Bin, which is what we in the know call the Coral Sea. Have a bottle of wine then tell me you’d be able to tell the difference between that migraine in a glass and the Real McCoy.”

However, Jackie said he plans to retrain his staff this coming Monday to help them with the rise in coffee orders.

He said they might even begin to offer milk with coffee this week just like they do in more cosmopolitan parts of the district such as Quilpie and Toompine.

The Advocate caught up with service station owner, Boris Sampson, to uncover exactly what Mr. Oakden purchased and to cast general aspersions about him. 

“He was loading up; salt and vinegar chips, oak chocolate milks, mild salsa, he even bought a longneck of Pepsi Max!” 

“I don’t usually judge, but I thought it was a lot of food. So, I said it was kind of him to be buying his family such a variety of treats” 

It’s understood that at that moment, Boris knew Mr. Oakden was in fact buying this sickening amount of food for himself. 

“Oh, long car trip then, I said. But nah. The bloke was just driving up to Diamantina Dam – that’s only 2 hours away!” 

“He’ll die if he’s not careful.” 

Our reporters reached out to Mr. Oakden for comment and to see just how much of his mobile feast he made it through in his short journey. 

“Mate, all of it” he said with unfounded confidence. 

“You tell me how you’d choose between those gems” 

“Ha, gems. Thanks for reminding me, I’m gonna go to Neville’s Fish and Chips to get some potato gems!”

Despite Mr. Oakden treating his body like the old Betoota Dump, he’s actually in good shape and ensures us it’s all above board with his 5:2 diet.

The new signing of the volatile, anti-social and violent, but impressively quick young winger Lolesio Prince (23) has seen the club tear through the 2018 season with 11 wins out of 12 – in what looks like an almost guaranteed top eight appearance in this year’s Channel Country Rugby League semi-finals.

They’ve got the community to be thankful for, as well. Namely the parents, members, a general crowd at each home and away game. Most of who have behaved themselves so well this year that the possibility of being re-invited to field a fourth grade side is back on the cards again.

They’ve got the staff to be thankful for, especially the volunteers – who spend hours upon hours each week lending themselves to the mighty terracotta and navy.

As is tradition in regional and suburban East Coast Australia, hospitality and gaming venues are operated for the benefit of locals rugby league club and its community. The football club controls the leagues club through the appointment of board members. In the past, leagues clubs have provided funds to finance the operation of the sporting club, often due to profits made from the inclusion of a gaming room.

In the case of the Betoota Dolphins, that ‘gaming room’ is actually a bit more like an acre of pokies, and a mini-casino-sized TAB.

As a consistent stream of income for the football club, this dining venue is celebrated by all in the community, as is it’s ability to fleece money out of lesser-known members of the community that are hidden in the VIP lounge.

However, aside from the nameless gambling addicts, there are several other integral contributors to the club that need to be thanked. One in particular is former Dolphins Leagues Club boardmember and chairman (1984-2002), Ken Walker.

“Thanks Ken” says Lolesio, while staring at the 182 cm x 122 cm framed portrait of him in the middle of the TAB, as he feeds another pineapple into the betting kiosk.

Those listening to the yarn shot looks at each other.

Darcy Beaumont looked over at Amy Stephens, sharing a knowing look that they’ve shared previously when Doug is telling a story from his life.

It is a look of utter disbelief with shades of actual belief as these things can only happen to Doug.

“All the milk shot out of the bowl and down the front of the windscreen and dashboard. All down my pants, too. It went down the vents and everything,” said Doug.

“So I rang Dad and told him what happened and what I could do to get the milk and Nesquik cereal out of the air conditioning. He just hung up on me.”

Suit Steaming Into House Party After Work Drinks Already On Borrowed Time

He also warned his mate, who he met on exchange in Budapest that he would be a little late as he had to attend a Friday staff drinks, as is the binding custom at his firm.

While things were going swimmingly at the party just kicking off in the French Quarter share house, everyone was keeping a lid on it for the time being.

That was until Ben came steaming in with three sheets to the wind.

“What did I do wrong? Why didn’t I get a nickname? Maybe I was too nice to everyone?”

George Robinson is far less frequent in the minds of his fellow students than it is on the Whooton Academy’s honour roll.

Though everyone in his small year group knows his name, knows that his father is a mildly popular solicitor in town and his mother, Dorothy, left them both for a handsome Noosa-based tennis coach.

They know he’s handy cricketer and a utility tri-code back.

But that’s about it.

Friends of the 18-year-old refer to him only as George – not even a humourous prefix such as ‘Boy’ or a witty suffix like ‘Michael’.

To them, he’s just another smiling face in the sea of well-built painfully-middle-class gentlemen that flood the hallways of the South West’s most exclusive school for boys.

Speaking candidly to The Advocate, one of George’s home-class friends detailed why they hadn’t bothered giving him a nickname.

“Some people are just born with the right name,” said Ralph Greenholm, who was christened ‘Radar’ in Year 7 because of his giant ears that stick out like the extended mirrors on a grey nomad’s Pajero.

“And George is one of those people. You just look at him and think ‘George’ and that’s it. It’s older brother Randolf got ‘Rah Rah’ because of his initials. That and he had a poster of Jason Little above his bed for 6 years,”

“Not that George is a bad guy at all, in fact, he’s quite nice. But yeah, that’s about the gist of it.”

Hippy Drama Teacher Going All Out For NAIDOC

While lamenting on her time spent up in the territory as a teenager, Betoota South High School drama teacher, Ms Webcke (62) stares off into the distance.

Ms Webcke is very rarely broken from her slow ballet of theatrical instruction. Never high, nor low. Always very chilled.

As one of the only non-unionised members of the institution, Webcke has always tried to instil a peacefulness into her students not seen elsewhere in this overcrowded public school.

In fact a recent survey of past students has found the 95% of graduates didn’t know what the word ‘karma’ meant until their year 8 performances pieces, most of which were meditative Buddhist improv skits, set in different scenarios that had been curated by their matriarchal thespian in accordance with her pupil’s energy.

Ms Webcke has never come across as, in her students would describe it, hectic.

That is until today.

NAIDOC day is around the corner, and Ms Webcke has got both guns blazing as she pays tribute to her kindred spirits. The longest surviving culture on this planet. Australia’s dearest First Nations people.

NAIDOC (National Aboriginal and Islander Day Of Celebrations Week is an Australian observance lasting from the first Sunday in July until the following Sunday.

NAIDOC Week celebrates the history, culture and achievements of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. The week is celebrated not just in the Indigenous communities but also in increasing numbers of government agencies, schools, local councils and workplaces.

While tributes will be paid to these celebrations early next week, Ms Webcke has taken it one further.

On top of the fact the she has somehow found a shop that sells Aboriginal flag bunting, as well as many many more associated accessories such as pins, jewellery, and posters – Ms Webcke is also making her students, across all grades, study the lyrics to the Warumpi Band’s iconic ‘Blackfella/Whitefella’.

“This song changed me when I was in Kakadu” she says.

“Then they all came back with $10 lunches from ‘Thai Me Up’ down the road and sat at the meeting table and ate it, while I tried my hardest not to look over longingly,” the man said, further admitting that he wished he had left his packed lunch in the fridge for another day.

“Fuck me. That place does such a good Pad See Ew too.”

“I’ll have to try and pull someone up this arvo about spending all their money on food and piss to make myself feel better.”

“No Reason That Linen Cupboard Can’t Be A Third Bedroom” Says 23-Year-Old Real Estate Agent

TEXT:

Married couple Jane and Daniel Kenny have been informed by real estate agent John ‘Sharkey’ Scarponi that there is no good reason why a linen cupboard can’t double as a third bedroom for their five-year-old son.

Having recently benefited from the services of an online mortgage broker, uno Home Loans, to repay their mortgage over the next decade or four, the Kennys have yet to be impressed by homes within their price range and are sceptical that a man who wants their son to live in a cupboard full of exposed nails has their best interests at heart.

“Haha you guys are lucky I’m not charging you for three bedrooms!” joked Scarponi as he showed the couple through the 1.3 million dollar house in a suburb neither of them are keen on. 

Realising he was losing their interest, Scarponi tried to convince five-year-old Lucas Kenny that living in a space that would stunt his growth would actually be kind of cool.

“You ever read Harry Potter buddy?! He lived in a thing sort of like this, you could be just like him!”

Jane Kenny states that, even though she would never raise her son in a linen cupboard, it is a better alternative than some suggestions from other real estate agents.

“This one bald prick suggested that we share a double bunk bed with both of our children and to set them up with some pillows in the bathtub when we wanted to do yoga stated Kenny as she tried fruitlessly to wash the indescribable feeling of uncleanliness Scarponi’s handshake had left on her palm. 

“Another tried to convince us that sleeping on a couch is better for your back to ease us into the idea the house had no bedrooms.”

Scarponi says he understands that people might have reservations about unconventional living arrangements but thinks more people should be open to the idea.

“Sleeping in the kitchen pantry isn’t so bad when you realise you’ve got 24-hour snack access! Or, set up a kids’ bedroom in the laundry, then it won’t matter if they leave their dirty clothes out! But alright, demand to have your own bedroom Mr La-dee-da.”

Fifth-Grade Club Cricketer Laughs As Captain Suggests They Start Pre-Season Training Next Week

TEXT:

“He’s a bit keen, isn’t he?” wrote Sam Perkins to the Dugong’s fifth-grade WhatsApp group.

Everyone’s in it except for the captain, Tex Taylor, who doesn’t even know it exists.

There’s an official one that he’s group admin of but it’s seldom used for anything other than official team business.

The latter of which sprang to life this morning.

A group training has been set for next week.

“Yeah, I know, right?” said another teammate.

“It’s too cold to be taking catches before work. My fingers will damn near snap off!”

The group agreed.

“I reckon a net session would kill me if I did one now. I’d pull up stiffer than a boogie board the next morning and I’m not about that noise in July, boys. Don’t know about you,” replied Sam.

Tex Taylor has been the fifth-grade captain for a number of years and for a bloke that calls himself an all-rounder, he’s deeply lacking in both aspects of his game.

But talk to any local park cricketer and they’ll tell you that doesn’t matter.

They’ll tell you that Tex loves the game, perhaps too much, to captain a team of general fuck-ups and latent perverts which some in the community refer to as the fifth-grade Dugongs team.

“So who’s going to tell him?” said Sam.

That message sat dormant until it received the double blue tick of shame.

At the time of print, it seemed nobody was going to let Tex know that nobody was keen to take the frost of Betoota Heights Oval 3 on Tuesday morning next week.

Local Motorist Faces Terrorism-Related Charges After Car Breaks Down On Crucial Arterial Road

TEXT:

A Betoota Heights man was arrested last night around 7 pm after police discovered that his car had broken down on the A34 onramp at the intersection of Collins Road in the Old City District – causing town-wide traffic chaos.

Traffic was backed back to the start of the A21 in Betoota Ponds, some seven kilometres from where the incident took place.

The man, named in court documents as Dale James Coleman, is now facing a number of serious terrorism-related charges after detectives ascertained that his vehicle was the sole cause of the disaster.

The 34-year-old was arrested by mounted police after a short foot pursuit close to where his vehicle was discovered.

Speaking to the media this morning, a Queensland Police spokesman said this was the first time anybody had been charged with such an offence in the Diamantina Shire.

“These are very serious charges and detectives from the major crimes squad are currently en route to Betoota to question the man,” they said.

“Police will allege that Dale James Coleman went to drive down the onramp to the A34 at approximately 6:40 pm last night in his 2001 Land Rover Discovery. Shortly after he turned onto the onramp, he noticed that both the oil pressure was low and the temperature was high. Rather than pull onto the breakdown lane, he continued to flog the disco until it couldn’t be flogged anymore,”

“He had ignored the fact that the vehicle had a blown head gasket for close to a week when the engine finally seized, causing the traffic chaos we saw,”

“His actions inconvenienced thousands and his blase attitude towards the well-being of other motorists is undiluted terrorism in the eyes of the law. That will be all for now.”

Coleman is due to face court later this month.

Local 18-Year-Old Panics At The Bar And Orders A $30 Corona Bucket

TEXT:

Turning 18 just before his final year in high school starts to get important, Dennis Goink’s inexperience when it comes to being in a licenced venue was laid bare this Monday afternoon after he panicked when asked what he – and the rest of his merry gaggle of freshly legal friends wanted to drink.

Looking the taps up and down, he didn’t see anything vaguely familiar.

The polite, yet charmingly meek Virgo is from a family of wine drinkers, save for the odd glass of neat scotch of a nasty winter’s evening.

But even the wine list he was flicking through down the Dolphins Leagues Club was gibberish to him.

Would he like the Grenache? What 2015 a good year in Coonawarra? There were too many variables.

Witnessing this fierce internal struggle course through young Dennis’ veins was our reporter, who took lunch at the club and never returned back to his desk.

“Ahhhhh,” uttered Dennis to the barmaid, Heather Throat.

Heather wasn’t amused by the fresh-faced youngster. As each passing ‘Ahhhh’ poured from Dennis’ mouth, the more Heather grew suspicious of his alleged 18 years on this planet.

“Do you and your classmates have any ID?” she asked.

Luckily, they all did.

This bought Dennis some valuable time to scan the bar for clues as to what he was going to order.

Like a gift from God, he and his five friends all spied the same sign at once.

“Can I get one Corona bucket, please? Does it come with six?”

Heather just kind of nodded and said it’d be $30.

Dennis nervously laughed and said it was a bargain before Heather slipped into the cool room to retrieve the seis cervezas for the lads.

The group pooled their money together and smiled as Dennis lifted it off the bar.

As they went to walk out onto the designated smoking balcony, they were pushing, shoving and joking around like they’d just successfully robbed a bank together and were about the reap the fruits of their crimes.

Hugo Weaving Strikes Back: “Everybody Who Went The Logies Took The Blue Pill”

TEXT:

Actor Hugo Weaving was criticised by a man on breakfast television last week for his obvious lack of enthusiasm surrounding his historical Logies Best Actor nod – saying that he should be more grateful to the bosom than spawned his impressive career.

It was revealed that Weaving, a Nigerian-born migrant, was snubbing the award ceremony last night because of his dislike of being used as a promotional pawn for big studios and whatnot.

However, after attracting the ire of countless industry juggernauts for his obvious lack-of-respect for the Australian television industry, Hugo has hit back.

Speaking exclusively to The Advocate today via wireless telephone, Weaving suggested that perhaps there’s something more to it than what meets the eye of his critics.

“I tuned in for a minute last night, I will admit,” he said.

“And I saw all those blue-pill-taking remora fish there. Hope the complimentary glass of Janz on arrival was worth the price of your soul.”

Weaving is making reference to a metaphor made popular by the 1999 blockbuster The Matrix, in which he starred, where the protagonist, Neo, is given a choice between returning to reality as he knows it or escaping it in a quest for truth.

The pills represent the choice between knowledge, freedom, and the brutal truths of reality (red pill) and Security, happiness and the blissful ignorance of illusion (blue pill).

“All these Logie people are blue pill people; that’s why I couldn’t be a part of it. They’re living in a simulation controlled by people they never see. I trust you understand.”

Human Being Perseveres With Speaking English To His Dog

“How are you mate, are you doing alright?” asks local dog-owner, Keiran.

His 3-year-old honey lab, Dilbert, doesn’t respond.

“How about this cold. You don’t like this cold do you? ” he asks.

Still no response.

No one else is around, so Keiran isn’t really playing this up. This is honestly what he does all the time with his dog.

Other than getting excited and being referred to as a good boy, Dilbert doesn’t appear to be able to understand English – which isn’t really a surprise, since he isn’t a human.

“Don’t eat the mandarin peels Dilbert. They aren’t good for dogs to eat. You, know that mate” he says, while scruffing him around the neck.

Keiran is just one of many millions of dog owners around the world who seem to think that slowly speaking English to his dog is the best way to communicate thoughts to him. Even more confusing for the dog, and everyone else, is the fact that the warm and loving pats don’t seem to correlate well with the lecture he is giving his domesticated pet.

“I’m surprised he’s persevering with it to be honest”s ays Keiran’s brother, Glenn.

“He could at least try to talk to him in French”

“Labradors come from that part of Canada, don’t they?”

At time of press, Keiran was seen explaining to Dilbert that by eating yet another corn cob that he found in the bin, he was in fact setting himself up for another visit to the vet.

Woman With No Reception In Bathroom Mindlessly Attempts To Refresh Instagram Feed

TEXT:

In a visit to a French quarter cafe’s bathroom, Bridget Jenkins (27), tried to unsuccessfully refresh her Instagram feed at least three times, it is understood.

The cafe bathroom is a known reception black spot, which often breeds desperation in the minds of excretors as they’re faced with the prospect of dealing with their head noises instead of numbing them with social media like they usually would.

Bridget is considered one of the lucky ones by only having to refresh her feed three times, there have been reports indicating that people have mindlessly refreshed the app upwards of 15 times.

There is in fact one man who refreshed his Instagram account over 20 times, our reporters tracked down this man however he was unable to comment, on account of him being of unsound mind in a remote asylum in the Diamantina region somewhere.

The Advocate caught up with Bridget shortly after her bathroom visit to see how she was feeling about the whole ordeal.

“Ugh it was the fucking worst, like get wifi or something”

“I nearly started to actually think about stuff”

“But then I tried to refresh it again and my mind was consumed by the prospect of the app actually refreshing.”

“Thank god it’s working again now though, I don’t know what I would do if I couldn’t constantly refresh my feed every 30 seconds. Who knows how much I would miss?”

“I don’t even want to think about it” finished Bridget, mindlessly refreshing her feed again to avoid actually thinking.

Scratches Around Sharehouse Keyhole Offer Clues Into The Lives Of The Degenerates Living Within

TEXT:

There is a house on Greenpoint Road in Betoota Heights in which four bags of shit live.

Not because they want to – but because they need to.

Within the walls of number 21, these young white cis-gendered heterosexual middle-class warriors often get up to no good.

Banjo, Gregory, Colin and Stanley love to blow off steam any way they can.

Bags of meth moonlighting as cocaine. Cleanskin red. The reefer.

Anything.

Which is why they often return home in a state of extreme disrepair.

And the part of the house that bores the brunt of there lifestyles is the area around the front door lock.

The scars, dents and scratches around the keyhole is a testament to that.

Speaking candidly to The Advocate this morning through a mild hangover, Gregory said he hadn’t noticed the state of the front door – but now that our reporter brings it up, he feels it’s a ‘great insight’ into the types of lives he and the other boys live.

“Yeah,” he said, rubbing his right eye with the ball of his left palm.

“I guess that’s a pretty good representation of who we are. The state of the front door lock. It’s a prima facia case. What’s the point in living if you don’t feel alive? I feel alive by getting absolutely twisted on drugs and alcohol at every opportunity I have,”

“And I guess by the time the little homing pigeon in my head gets me home, getting the key in the front door proves to be a challenge. Res ipsa loquitur, let the good times roll.”

Report: Dodgy Older Labourer Loves Going To Thailand

TEXT:

A local loudmouth and downright degenerate landscaper has once again had another crack at talking about rub and tugs in front of the other subcontractors at a South Betoota worksite today.

Keith Keithington (60) has come in strong with a story about how he paid an illegal sex worker to give him a hand job while visiting an discreet shop front in a nearby light industrial district.

“Not bad” he says to the uncomfortable younger blokes he has never met before.

Like many dodgy units around the country, Keith’s entire image is based around the problematic hedonism he takes part in every night.

This usually means anyone working with him is exposed to yarns about his hardy brag-worthy sexual exploits, rampant gambling and a never-ending stream of possibly made up biffs.

After trying time and time again to normalise his obsession with ‘happy endings’ – Keith is met with looks of confusion and concern on the faces of his coworkers – many of whom are married and not big on the dodgy massage parlour scene.

While the surrounding tradesmen wonder why he doesn’t just visit one of the many legal brothels in downtown Betoota, Keith then launches into another yarn about Thailand.

“Ever been to Thailand?” he asks, in a hope to steer the story towards his most recent dodgy massage holiday.

Exhausted Man Writhing Around In Bed At 4AM Not Quite Tired Enough To Periodically Check Phone

Despite his best effort, Damien Cottonwell didn’t get much rest last night.

A heavy Carbonnara dinner; he even used full fat cream.

“I know it’s not the traditional recipe but I was feeling naughty,” he explained to The Advocate this morning.

“But I was hunting a good night’s sleep so I had a huge dinner and went to bed early. Only had four coffees yesterday as well. None after 3 pm. Anyway, there I was in my little bed at 10 pm waiting for Mr Sandman to pay me a visit,”

“But he never came.”

Our reporter saw the 26-year-old leasing agent at the Dolphins Leagues Club on Saturday and Sunday nights where he appeared to be under the heavy influence of alcohol and nicotine.

Many of the other town’s folk were as well.

The denizens of Betoota Heights were out in force to see the Queenslanders go down to the filthy New South Welshmen on Sunday while the uppity Betoota Grove bourgeois had a sad drive home in the Range Rover on Saturday night as the Wallabies predictably went down to the greatest team in the Northern Hemisphere.

“But I had a good night’s rest on both nights. I was home in bed by 3 each night. Needless to say, I was basically a deaf-mute on both nights. If anything, I should be sleeping deeper than Gough Whitlam right now. Instead, I’m writing around absolutely exhausted at 4 am on a Tuesday morning completely unable to sleep,”

“I don’t get it. I keep trying to tire my eyes out looking at memes but it’s not working. I must be staring at my phone every five minutes.”

The Advocate reached out to a number of people at the Royal Betoota Institute of Sleep Studies for comment but the center doesn’t open until noon.

Matte Finish On M3 Suggests Local Drug Dealer Wants To Go To Jail

TEXT:

Betoota’s top drug dealer, Jyleigh Barron, has been elusive to local police for the 10 years. Always seemingly 2 steps ahead of them. That was until he bought himself a ten-year-old BMW M3.

It isn’t this particular car that gave Jayden away, it was the fact that he decided to apply a matte finish to the exterior of the vehicle – which, in police circles, is the calling card of a drug dealer.

Speaking to the Advocate earlier, Constable Aramayo gave a top line explanation of how matte finish cars are what utes are to tradies.

“Well, I don’t know the particular science behind it, but I believe it has something to do with the dealers being able to easily clean their products off the car bonnet”

“I should confirm that with our lab though.”

“Either way, we’ve got that Jyleigh now.”

For reasons we don’t wish to disclose, the Advocate has managed to form somewhat of a close relationship with Jyleigh and we were able to uncover his legitimate reason for getting a matte finish.

“It’s just fucken sick, bra [sic]”

When asked whether he was concerned that it was a literal beacon for police he responded

“I’d like to see those pigs catch me.”

At the time of writing, Jyleigh has not yet been arrested by Betoota’s law enforcement. Sources close to the investigation revealed that they’re waiting for him to commit some kind of misdemeanour before they choose to arrest him.

Everyone Shut Up! Hayley Is About To Tell A Quite Visual Recount Of Her Most Recent Root

A group of five girlfriends have been told to shut the fuck up this evening, because Hayley is back in the game.

While catching up for their bi-monthly girls dinner, the group of girls who make up a fusion of both work and high school friends, have got some serious goss to sink their teeth into.

Most notably, the fact that Hayley’s drought has broken, in a big way – with a temporary but fucking hot gym junkie named Kyle that she met at the physiotherapist of all places.

“He’s not a physio. But like he does something like that” says Hayley, who will not be marrying this man.

The group alpha, Katie, was the first to pick up on an out-of-place chirpiness at the table – and was almost psychic in her assumptions that Hayley has been getting the pipe.

After a bit of pushing, she starts getting some oil.

While the rest of the table continues gas-bagging, Katie needs to reign in their attention, because they are gonna wanna hear this.

“SHUT UP EVERYONE” says Katie!

Everyone looks, fearing the worst from that end of the table, like a pregnancy or something.

“Hayley has been getting it”

As the subsequent woohoo sounds echo right across the restaurant, even diners as far as the front door of the restaurant appear to know what these girls are talking about.

It’s established quite early on in the retelling of this explosive and passionate romance that Kyle is missing a few roos in the top paddock, but it is also made clear that Hayley wasn’t looking to get an intellectual companion out of this relationship.

As the table begins to get more and more rowdy throughout the course of Hayley’s quite visual recount of their first root, a cluey restaurant manager realises where he needs to me right now.

“Shots, ladies?” asks Pablo.

“On the house”

Punter Who Bet On Number Of Corners During World Cup Last Night Could Stop Now If He Wanted To

Oliver Braddon has assured The Advocate this morning that he could stop gambling literally anytime he felt like it.

The 27-year-old solicitor at Adams & Adams in the French Quarter, who would reportedly bet on two flies walking up a wall, sat down with our reporters to outline why his girlfriend’s concerns are unfounded.

Braddon, who bet on over 7.5 corners to occur in the 10 pm Morocco v Portugal game last night, explained that he only punts because he is bored.

“Nah seriously though, like if I actually wanted to I could stop tomorrow,” he said.

“But I don’t want to stop. So ahh yeah I’m not going to. But I could if I felt like it,” said the boyfriend who had a nudge on some South Korean Volleyball a week ago.

“It’s not like it’s a problem anyway. I don’t understand what the problem is.”

However, Braddon’s girlfriend Courtney informed us that she has a slightly different perspective on the matter.

“He has asked me numerous times this year if I wanted to go on a date day with him to the races,” she said.

“Uh no. But I do find it incredibly romantic when we go out to dinner and he checks his phone every 5 minutes ‘for work.’ It’s almost cute how clever he thinks he is, but I can see through him like a pane of fucking glass.”

“Anyway, he can’t stop but he needs to. I’m going to call his mum tomorrow and throw him under a bus. Oh and I’m going to transition us to a shared credit card,” Courtney said.

Report: Uncle Boof’s Been Playing Up Again

TEXT:

A recent report by everyone at a Schultz family barbecue has found that Uncle Boof might have been carrying on over the last few months.

Last thought to be working FIFO in Moranbah, Uncle Boof has been flying under the radar for a while now, and it doesn’t sound like he’s been seeing much of Kath and his kids.

When asked by Nan what he’s been up to, and why he never calls, Boof says he’s taken up a job installing smoke detectors in government buildings – and he’s just been so busy.

“Bobby hooked me up with this gig. Pays good” he says, in reference to a mate that he thinks everyone else has met before.

“It used to be his job but he had to go up north”

Boof’s inability to explain why his mate ‘Bobby’ had left town, or why he currently has an ankle monitor homing device bolted around his leg, leaves the rest of the family to presume that he’s fucked up again.

“You behaving yourself Boof?” asks Nan’s brother, Bruce.

“Why the fuck did you decide to wear sandals? I’d be wearing flairs if I had one of those fucking things strapped to me”

Uncle Boof says it’s nothing serious, and that he was caught speeding on his restricted work driver’s licence, even after a special hardship order.

No one really believes Boof’s yarn, but the fact that he’s here alone and doesn’t have any of his dodgy mates floating around for lunch is enough for him to just glide through the afternoon while Nan keeps a close eye on how much he’s drinking.

Trolley Boy Too Damn Good At His Job To Be Let Go For Intimidating Shoppers, Smoking Weed

A modern day stockman at the local Coles has once again survived several allegations of calling people fuckwits and smoking dirty bungers.

The pimply teenager, who claims to have punched on with blokes as old as 19, will not be getting fired for his recent misconduct.

Management states that Corey (15) is too damn good at his job to be replaced with just any other local hoodrat – and while they acknowledge that his anti-social behaviour is a considered flaw, it’s one they are willing to overlook.

Following a number of stern complaints about his behaviour, the suggested termination of his employment has been completely squashed, the barely-enrolled-local-high-schooler elegantly musters a mob of twenty steel heffers into the suburban cattle crush, which is situated between the disabled carp parks and the entrance to the BWS.

Team Passing Drill Throw A Curve Ball As Prop Cheekily Handballs The Steeden

If fourth-grade suburban rugby league is the sport of kings – Paddy O’Connor is certainly the crown price of the local competition.

Either that or court jester – according to those who play with the swashbuckling 29-year-old prop forward.

Case in point being at a forwards gym and drill session down the Dolphins Leagues Club this morning, says his long-suffering captain and scrum-mate, Mike Redpath.

“We were working on our hand skills this morning because we had a lot of drop ball on Saturday; not good enough,” said Redpath.

“It’s a good activity to warm the boys up before we pump iron. Anyway, so this morning, we’re running a cross drill with two balls. You know what I mean, just those short sharp pop passes, agility building and whatnot,”

“So Paddy gets the ball in from the right then handballs it to his left. Fuck it was funny but it wasn’t the right time for joking around like that. I had to reprimand him for not taking the drill seriously – though it broke my heart to do so. It really threw the bloke who caught it a curveball, regardless. He almost coughed it up.”

Our reporter reached out to the big kahuna for comment – and promptly received a poorly thought out reply.

“Yeah, just thought I’d spice things up. I’m originally from Melbourne and I played Victorian Football as a youth so handballing things comes naturally to me,”

“I even handballed the missus a loaf of bread this morning in the kitchen. She kinda cough laughed and told me not to but I know she was impressed. It’s hard to hide a genuine smile,”

“But oi, yeah but perhaps nah. I’ll probably to it again, I like keeping things interesting by throwing out curveballs such as handpassing a Steeden. Classic.”

Sickening Chemical Odours Wafting Out Into Arcade Suggest This Nail Salon Might Be The One

TEXT:

A local nail salon in Betoota’s inner-city suburb of Roma Hills has been rated as a solid 9.5/10, judging solely off the smell.

ToP pOLiSh can be found at the the sixth left-hand shopfront in the grimey Roma Arcade, just between the RTA and the prominent Australianised Chinese Restaurant, Red Lotus.

While no one you know has actually gotten their nails done at ToP pOLiSh, the fact that there’s always someone in there says enough – when you take into account how many nail salons exist in the world.

However, the real selling point in the stench of chemicals that smell like they could fuck you up if they were exposed to any part of your body that isn’t made up of the protective protein known as alpha-keratin (finger nails).

“Mmmm…” says one shopper, Kelly, while walking past with her girlfriends.

“Remind me to go in there next time”

While Kelly can not identify why she needs to go into that store more so than the two others in the arcade, her dilated pupils suggest her senses have been stimulated. Most likely related to the smell wafting out.

Much like the laundromat further down the shopping centre, the very visible lack of white people working inside the store also indicates that this is the best place to get a manny peddy.

4-Hour Drive Confirms New Girlfriend Is Not Quite On Beyonce’s Level Yet

TEXT:

Betoota Hills robot, Colin Dominican (29) thought his newish life partner, Sandra Wentworth (28), had it all going for her. She was hot, funny, loved footy and getting around his mates – in his eyes she was perfect.

That was until they decided to have a weekend away together at the Diamantina Resort, 4hrs North of Betoota. As there are no flights to the exclusive resort, the couple decided to drive – a decision that would cost Colin his fairytale.

Two hours into the trip, the general conversation was waning and Sandra suggested they put on some music.

“Ooo I love this song” said Sandra.

The song in question was Beyoncé’s 2008 hit, Halo, a pop power ballad, the lyrics of which describe a sublime love. It features drum, piano, keyboard, string, synthesizer, and percussion instrumentation, and a repetitive chorus that should not ever be attempted by anyone but Beyoncé.

“Let me see your HAAALLLOO” Sandra belted out, neither in tune or with the correct lyrics.

“HAALLOO, HALO, HAAYYLOOOW” she belted again, each note more jarring than the last.

Speaking to The Advocate in private once at the resort, Colin described his devastation.

“Mate, I’ve never heard anyone sing that bad”

“I’m gutted”

“Just think of all the road trips we’re going to be having, Betoota’s not close to anything!”

“What am I gonna do?”

Our reporter abstained from offering relationship advice on this matter, however she did suggest some ear plugs as a temporary fix.

Grease Medley Megamix Saves Boring Wedding

TEXT:

A Betoota Ponds wedding has been saved from being a completely lacklustre affair with the DJ deciding to whack on the Grease Medley Megamix and crank it up to 11.

According to wedding DJ Walter Casey (54) he doesn’t usually smash the Grease Medley Megamix until later in the evening but upon seeing what an uptight and sorrid affair this wedding reception was, decided to take matters into his own hands.

“People were leaving before the bride and groom so they wouldn’t miss Midsummer Murders,” stated the DJ.

“Also the cannelloni starter was a little cold. It’s really hard to recover from that. Nothing a little Grease can’t save.”

Upon hearing the opening notes of Grease Lighting, the lifeless eyes of the suburban wedding guests lit up, with the resulting rush to the dancefloor injuring at least one waiter.

“I’m aware of the power this song has on people. It makes you forget that some of the lyrics are quite sexist”

Forgetting how boring everything had been thus far, the wedding attendees began forming funny little boy-girl groups that took turns singing the adorably sexist lyrics.

The dance reached a climax as best man Danny Etherington and the brides great aunt Norma Hollis embraced and twisted around in a circle during the final high notes of Summer Nights.

“Dancing with Norma that was funny as fuck!” stated brother of the groom Jock Lowe as he moved his tie from his neck to around his head for a harmless joke.

Jeronimo, who is laying on the couch adjacent to his housemate, Clive, is trying his best to recall what could have possessed him to allow someone to press a 600-degrees-Celsius smouldering stick of tobacco into, arguably, the most sensitive section of skin on the human body.

“Fuck what was I thinking?”

“Someone must have pinned me down”

“There’s no way I let this happen”

Jeronimo continued to recap his night, constantly asking Clive if he had any idea who would do this to him.

According to our reports, however, Clive was, in fact, the one who inflicted the cigarette burn on Jeronimo.

We reached out to Clive for comment, who was more than happy to reveal the truth.

“Yeah, boys, it was a pissa”

“He was walkin’ around with his shirt off, flexing, saying ‘nothing can hurt these guns’”

“I just thought, fuck it, I bet I can. And I burnt the shit out of him”

“Don’t tell him, but. I like that he’s in the horrors today. He’s a jed on the piss.”

It’s understood that Jeronimo still has no idea that it was Clive, his closest confidant, who tarnished his soft alabaster skin.

Study Finds Fresh Plant Horses Should Be Right After A Few Neck Rubs

TEXT:

A recent survey conducted by the Australian Stock Horse Association (ASHA) has found that fresh plant horses that live to throw first-year jackaroos can be pacified by a simple rub on the neck and a few kind words.

The group’s spokesman spoke briefly to The Advocate via telephone this morning to discuss the study’s findings.

“Horses can smell fear; they can tell when someone is nervous around them,” said the ASHA’s Tim Stanley.

“So most importantly, just try to be confident around them. Especially young plant horses that’ve just been broken. Most mornings, especially when you’re just not in the mood, they’ll be hard to catch and once you get them saddled up, they’ll inevitable drop out on you,”

“But this recent discovery will stop that from happening.”

Stanley went on to explain that once an especially inexperienced horseman is atop a fresh plant horse – just as the sun’s coming up over the dunes and it begins to pig root – the horse will calm down and be nice after just a couple neck rubs and ‘easy boys’.

“Just give it a rub and whisper softly in its ear. It’s as easy as that.”

One young stationhand that’s put the study’s findings to good use, also spoke candidly to our reporter this morning.

Fresh from being thrown to the length of his reins at daybreak today, local first-year ringer Marty Gilroy said the advice is timely and needed for people in his industry.

“I can’t wait to put this new knowledge into practice,” said the dough-banging Pearson Downs cowboy.

“Tell you what, I’m sick to death of getting spat first thing in the morning. It’s cold and I’m about as flexible as a boogie board before 7. I’ve got this wookatook blue colt that I honestly reckon is out to fucking kill me. He bit me on the trap when I hogged his mane last week, you should see the bruise,”

“Plus, I’ve got a new Kent saddle that this little girl in the catalogue said that it’s impossible to fall out of. I’m going to have to call bullshit on that. I’ve had it for a week and I’ve been thrown out the front of it, out the back, both sides and straight out the top like a fighter pilot ejecting. Maybe she knew the neck rub trick before me?”

Bilingual Mate Asked To Showcase His Second Language After Three Schooners

TEXT:

“Hey Christian,” bellowed Christan’s oldest mate from the office, Dave.

“Come over here and speak some of your fucking parseltongue to these blokes. What’s that thing you say?”

Christian had to interrupt a conversation he was having with another coworker and come over to Dave Gregson, who was now swaying in the cool desert air like a lively brigalow tree.

Along with young Dave stood two other colleagues that Christian vaguely knew and honestly didn’t care for much – but he wasn’t about to let them down.

He cleared his throat.

“Suge din egen pik!” he whispered.

Dave laughed alone with the two others smiled and nodded in agreement.

“Did you fucking hear that?” laughed Dave.

“What the fuck was that?! It sounds like he’s burnt his tongue!”

The other two men standing beside him smiled intensely.

One of them broke ranks and asked:

“What language is that?”

Chrisitan looked down at a now doubled-over Dave then back up at the faceless coworker next to him.

“It’s Danish.”

Suddenly Dave collapsed onto the floor in utter hysterical laughter.

“Just like the fucking pastry!”

Everybody in the room had since turned toward them to see what the fuss was about.

“Oh, Christian must be speaking his pig latin again,” said one accountant devoid of a personality.

“Yes,” said another.

Inner-City Leftie Cuts Line Of Coke With Forehead Of Colombian Child On World Vision Card

TEXT:

An apathetic inner-city leftie looked into his wallet this afternoon during a long-corporate-lunch looking for a rarely-used card to cut a line of cocaine with.

Behind his expired Medicare card, Darcy Saxon-Willis found one he’d never used to slice himself off a bit of nosé before – a $75 World Vision Gift Card he meant to give his free-spirited sister for her birthday last year.

So at approximately 3 pm this afternoon, the 34-year-old mergers and acquisitions specialist retreated to a corner of the private dining room at the Cheval et Chein Steakhouse in the French Quarter with two colleagues and began to indulge in their latin talking dust.

“This is good shit,” said Sam Gerhert, another mergers and acquisitions specialist in a $600 suit present at the drug taking.

Of the three times he’s been in the right place at the right time to be offered a line, this is the best.

However, he couldn’t help but notice the card in Darcy’s right hand.

“That’s pretty fucked up,” said Sam.

Darcy looked up from his phone and looked dumbfounded.

“The card! [laughs] How like the only reason you’ve got that in your hand is because of the drug conflict in Colombia – and you’re using it to cut up the end result of that conflict,” added Sam.

Lifting his top lip to run the top of the gift card across his gums, Darcy’s eyes looked stern as he thought of a response once he got the use of his mouth back.

“We should be worrying about Adani, it will ruin the reef,” he said.

“And what about Barnaby Joyce? What a hypocrite! All I’m saying is that there are bigger issues here that we should fix before we go messing in other people’s business,”

“Plus, this card means I’ve donated $75 to World Vision. What have you done?”

Sam shrugged and asked if he could have one more before they rejoined the lunch.

Awkward Man Needs To Find New Cafe After Barista Learns His Name

TEXT:

A systems engineer at South Betoota Polytechnical College is in need of a new cafe to go to today after the barista at his usual haunt started calling him by his first name.

“I haven’t got time or the inclination to make any new friends,” said Colin Rawlins, 34.

“So the bloke at the Weeping Shingle Blister Cafe, that one just off campus down O’Donoghue street, he’s started greeting me each morning by saying, ‘Hey Col! Just the usual today, mate?’ I know he’s trying to be nice but I haven’t got the sufficient social skills to ask for something different should I want it,”

The wooden space robot paused and swallowed deeply.

“Like some mornings, I feel like a cappuccino with banana bread. Only if I’ve had a bad morning. Most of the time I get a short black and that’s it. When he didn’t really want to be my friend, he’d ask me what I wanted, which was great. No eye contact, no asking about my life, just a transaction between two strangers.”

This has created a dilemma for Colin.

He says respects himself too much to drink instant coffee and that the nearest coffee place is miles away, so he’s hatched a plan this afternoon.

Colin blew a breath and blew it defeatedly through his loose lips.

“Would it be weird if I started wearing a disguise? Like if I died my hair black and grew a moustache” he asked our reporter.

Our reporter nodded and told him not to do that.

“What if I started faking a Southern accent? Like if I sounded like Forrest Gump or handsy Kevin Spacey in House of Cards?”

Our reporter said that was also a very, very bad idea and that type of behaviour would only alienate him further from society.

Colin sighed heavily and said he was all out of ideas.

Morning Meeting Now Just Passive Aggressive Comments About How Loud Jessica Types

TEXT:

“Is it raining outside?” asked one robotic middle-manager to another.

“Or is that hail?”

Those in earshot looked turned to their collective right and looked out the window.

Nothing but soft winter sunshine.

But they knew that, they were just making another jibe at Jessica Pearson’s loud typing – something that’s fast become the talk of the open-plan media agency office.

During a morning meeting today, all concept of organisation and productivity went out the window as the team took turns making passive aggressive comments about how loud young Jessica’s keystrokes are and how distributive they are.

“You’d think Fred Astaire is in the next room dancing on the fucking wall,” said a faceless media buyer.

“Like, the dancing prick is lying prone on a desk just tap tap tapping away on the wall just for the fuck of it, you know what I mean?”

The Big Bang Theory devotees all laughed and made properly uncomfortable eye contact with Jess, who was now trying to laugh along with everyone as she stared at the floor.

“Yeah!” piped up the token office Pom.

“I’ll be able to sue the bejesus out of this company for industrial deafness! It’s actually fucked.”

All the while this was going on, nobody used her name but everybody knew who the topic of conversation was.

Then as the ruckus calmed down, just as the boss walked in, Jessica snapped and threw a stapler at the token office Pom.

Had Jess not been the softball pitcher of the North Betoota Gorilla’s premiership-winning team last year, it would’ve merely been a soft boink on the noggin with a few gasps.

However, police and ambulance crews have attended the Daroo Street offices of the dime-a-dozen media agency after a call to 000 was made shortly before 11 this morning.

The stapler hit the Pom square in the forehead and paramedics are concerned that his brain may have suffered a full factory reset and may never be the same again.

The victim is currently in Royal Betoota Base Hospital in a stable condition.

Report: The Boys Are Going Through Their Backwards Peace Sign Phase

TEXT:

A recent report by a prominent Betoota nightclub photographer has found that a bunch of local early-20s blokes are now doing that thing with their hands.

Since May this year, local photographer Xander (19) has been taking snaps of partygoers right across Betoota’s prominent nightclub district, The Gulley, which is home to at least 5 different megaclubs that are all owned by the same Italian family – and wildly popular with the town’s working class youth.

Xander says while he’s noticed most young men go through a backward peace sign phase, it appears that this particular group of boys have completely forgotten how to do anything else with their hands.

Brad, Kel and Boofa, both 24, have featured in at least six different club photos over the last three weeks – each time posing with both the index and middle fingers outstretched as if to say ‘whatup’.

But these V-signs aren’t the front facing ‘save-the-world’ type. They’re the backwards ‘yeah-I’m-a-tough-cunt’ type.

“I guess it’s the inevitable next step after the shaka” says the photographer.

“The fact that one of them is always holding a bottle of water indicates they might be from a local rugby league team, or bikie gang, and are in the middle of shredding down for Summer”

At time of press, the boys were seen out the back of Betoota’s iconic electronic dance venue The Nightspot (also known as the Fightspot) aggressively sharing a cigarette while death staring a bunch of 18-year-old first timers.

Office Slob Forced To Reveal He Didn’t Iron After Office Heater Wins Battle With Jumper

TEXT:

Nathan Hawkins (29) likes to save time in his morning routine by only ironing his shirt collar, which, when wearing underneath a smart jumper, is not visible to the naked and untrained eye.

However, today in Betoota’s only self-regulating high rise, a faulty thermostat has resulted in the usually arctic office’s temperature soaring just above 30 degrees Celsius – which, as Nathan is finding out, is just too bloody hot to be wearing a jumper.

As people stripped off around him, Nathan tried to remain calm and ignore his growing underarm sweat.

Nathan’s best mate and office shit-stirrer spotted Nathan visibly struggling with the temperature and immediately knew that this meant he hadn’t ironed the rest of his shirt, again.

“Nath, mate, aren’t you hot?” Asked Nathan’s colleague, Adam, feigning concern.

“Oh nah, nah, I’m sweet” replied Nathan.

“Mate, I can see you dripping. Why don’t you just take the jumper off?”

At this point Nathan’s body temperature sky rocketed, not only was the office steaming but his jumper wearing was causing quite the commotion. It was clear to Nathan that he had no choice.

He removed his jumper.

“Hahahaha” Adam burst out laughing.

The advocate understands that Nathan had sweat so much under his jumper that his light blue collared shirt now resembled a poorly drawn map of the world.

“When are you gonna learn mate?” Adam said, shaking his head as he walked back to his desk.

It is not yet known whether Nathan has got back at Adam for outing his lazy, or cunning, approach to his work attire. We suspect it’s in the pipeline.

Unemployed Mate’s Obscure Hinterland Day Trip Definitely Drug-Related

TEXT:

Stay at home son, Luke Darcy (22) has arrived home from an obscure hinterland day trip where everybody who distantly knows the young degenerate can confirm he was definitely there to pick magic mushrooms.

Parents of the guest room clogging son claim Darcy left home uncharacteristically early, departing in his silver ‘99 Hyundai Excel at approximately 6:45 am and not returning until 8:20 pm with dirt beneath his fingernails and no real explanation for where he had been.

“Just felt like going bush for a bit,” smiled the avid VICE reader from beneath his multicoloured beanie.

Friends of Darcy state shroom season is more important to the high school leaver than any other calendar date, with his personal countdown to first harvest often beginning in February.

“I doubt he could even sleep the night before,” stated close friend Jamie Alcock (22).

“He’s probably got a bag of shrooms in his bedside table that’s bigger than any bag of groceries he’s bought before.”

Alcock hopes that Darcy was more prepared for his harvest than previous years when he got lost during his mushroom search and was forced to drink bong water.

“And I hope he knows he owes me about half of his shrooms after all the beers and smokes he’s bummed off me since shroom season ended.”

Darcy refused to comment on his personal debt to Alcock but stated his best friend needed to ‘chill out’ because ‘everything is going to be fine’ according to him.

“It’s all amazing mate! Look how many colours are on the TV right now, have you ever even seen that before?”

White Friends Banned From Brunch After Not Discussing Kanye West

TEXT:

The brunch community is in crisis after a table of white dinners were banned from Saturday morning brunch at a French Quarter cafe for discussing a topic that was not Kanye West.

Witnesses claim the group of six Caucasians took their table at Stone & Stone cafe at approximately 11:30 am and were hardly two bites into their corn and zucchini fritters before they were asked to leave for failing to bring up Kanye West as a topic of discussion.

Statements from witnesses allege the ‘Brunch Six’ discussed their recent trip to Japan, what they would do if they were baby boomers, ABC TV shows from the ‘90s, future plans to travel to Japan and Childish Gambino but never once discussed the music or recent goings on of rapper Kanye West.

“Brunch is an inclusive environment for everyone but antisocial behaviour like this will simply not be tolerated,” said Matt Cialatte (34) manager of Stone & Stone cafe.

“We are a place for trendy white and or extremely rich Asian people to think they are cool while discussing Kanye West over food that looks better than it tastes. The Brunch Six are deviants and nothing more.”

According to Cialatte, he has sent a photo of the antisocial dinning group to all brunch venues in the French Quarter, warning other cafe owners that these individuals will not help uphold the gentrified atmosphere people like him have worked so hard to force into the community.

In the centre of the controversy, the Brunch Six state they have received a lot of support from brunch enthusiasts with the hashtag #istandwiththebrunchsix receiving 110,000 mentions on Twitter from people who also feel pressure to talk about Kanye West at brunch.

The group has since revealed the whole brunch was actually a protest to oppressive (yet unspoken) brunch rules that dictate inner-city semi-professional white people have to spend at least 40% of their brunch discussing Kanye West.

“To be honest, we were wondering if we actually going to be able to do it, but bravery prevailed in the end and we paid the price for it,” stated Brunch Six ringleader Patrick Lowe (26).

“I was tired of pretending to like Kanye while I was eating my poached eggs. I don’t even think I have a favourite Kanye song. What’s the one with the motorbike in the video?”

Police Roll Out Fun Detection Dogs In Effort To Prove They Aren’t Too Good At Catching Dealers

TEXT:

The drug enforcement squad at the Betoota Heights Police Command has fired a salvo over the bow of festival goers this summer by announcing a number of new measures aimed at deterring fun.

Detective Inspector David Rutledge of Queensland Police said new fun detection dogs will be rolled out alongside their drug-sniffing canine brothers and sisters this year in an effort to make the festival experience safer for all involved.

“Revellers have been put on notice,” he said sternly.

“In addition to making sure nobody has anything they shouldn’t have on them, these new dogs will weed out anyone having too much fun. That will allow us to remove them from the scene heavy-handedly, then deleted the bodycam footage and close ranks when the rats from Internal Affairs come knocking,”

“Honestly, I can’t wait to have a hand in giving a teenager a criminal record. I fucking live for that shit. Back to what I was saying. These new canine officers are part of a wider program aimed at keeping the community safe.”

In addition to the new fun detection dogs, artists at festivals such as Betoota City Limits, and the French Quarter Folk Festival have been asked to remove lyrics alluding to drug taking, premarital fornication and why Sir Joh deserved to die in prison.

A small price to pay,  says City Limits promoter, Gary Carmen.

“Our balls are in a vice as it is,” he said.

“In order for us to keep doing what we’re doing, we need to take what the police and shire council give us, then say thank you.”

“Thank you for affording us the opportunity to have this festival, it should be great.”

Self-Described Bookish Man Still Telling Coworkers He Watched Attenborough’s Tasmania Over Joyce Interview

TEXT:

“I mean, there’s just no way I could condone what he’s done,” he said.

“He took money for an interview as a sitting Member of Parliament for Christ’s sake! The whole thing smacks of democratic failure. Did I watch it? God no! I tuned into the new David Attenborough documentary on Tasmania! It was amazing,”

“Especially that shit with the glow worms things in the cave? Huh? Imagine being on mushrooms and seeing that.”

Bryce Porter even has the glasses to match his personality.

Thick, black but ultimately redundant.

Many in the boutique, small law firm he works at have the suspicion that the 34-year-old doesn’t even need glasses, he just wants to be taken seriously.

Something he punctuates on the hour as he spins around in his chair to tell yet another coworker that he chose to boycott Seven’s Barnaby Joyce interview – for personal reasons.

But, he concedes, the only reason why he chose to boycott the interview was that he heard someone he regards as being learned say they were going to.

“One of our partners is a serious genius, like she’s done shit in the High Court before. She told me last Friday that she wasn’t going to watch it because nothing new was going to come to light. Then she told me about the new Attenborough doco, so I tuned into that,” he said.

“Then after that was over, I picked up and book and curled up on the couch listening to jazz. I think the notion that the Joyce interview was just ‘bogan bait’ and a ‘ratings coup’ is a correct one.”

Our reporter breathed out heavily and clicked the recorder off.

Man’s Vomit-Speckled Boots Suggest Weekend Was Bigger Than He’s Letting On

Clip-clopping his way down the hill from the French Quarter Busway to the Financial District, one bleary-eyed city worker’s boots speak volumes for what he got up to over the weekend.

Speaking to The Advocate in the designated smoking area of the building his firm and our newspaper share, Doug Leary told our reporter that he had a quiet one over the weekend and that he didn’t do much.

“Saw a few mates on Saturday night,” he said.

“Had a few beers, watched Carlton get flogged. Saw the Sharks get beat and chuckled to myself when someone told me the U20 Wallabies got done by the fucking Welshmen. Not much else,”

“What did you get you get up to?”

That is largely irrelevant, however, our reporter then questioned Doug over the state of his over-priced, Italian-owned clip-cloppers – suggesting that the matter speckled all over them was once inside his stomach.

He frowned and took a heavy, undulating drag from his John Player Special.

“Yeah, fair play,” he said.

“I was double-parked on two pints for most of the night. My mates drink so fast. I wanted to say I was right but I felt they’d chastise me for not being able to keep up with them. Next thing I know, I’m in Subway ordered a seafood sensation on white bread with old English melted on it – seriously, don’t knock it till you try it – then all of a sudden, I’ve got my hands against a wall and I’m throwing my guts up,”

“And some of it must’ve spattered on my boots. But that’s between me and my God, which is Ricky Ponting. Anyway, nobody in my office needs to know that. I’m the fire warden, I have responsibilities.”

Shirtless Bloke Obnoxiously Chewing Gum At Gym Wonders What Else He Can Do To Get Noticed

TEXT:

A particularly shredded, tanned and probably arrogant 6”3 man has today walked into Betoota’s popular weight training centre, the Lead Shed, open-mouth-chewing chewing gum and seemingly forgetting to wear a shirt.

While this combination usually garners a lot of welcome attention for Jackson Harris, today in the Lead Shed, nobody could care less.

In an attempt to turn some heads, Jackson began throwing around some free weights – the sheer ear-piercing sound of metal on metal turned heads, but it was what happened next that really got people looking.

“Ahhhh!” one woman let out a shrill scream.

“What the fuck is wrong with you?” She spat at Jackson, who was now panicking.

Everyone rushed to the woman’s side, an off-duty doctor at the scene was quick to diagnose the woman with a broken foot.

“I think it’s best if you leave, mate” said Rusty the club manager.

With his tail between his legs, Jackson left the premises. Catching up with The Advocate a short while after the incident, Jackson admitted the situation really spiraled out of control.

“Fuck, I just wanted to get people to look at me. The bird’s foot I broke was so hot too, do you reckon I’m still in with a shot?”

“What hospital is she in? I’ll bring her some flowers.”

With the woman planning on pressing charges, we suspect that Jackson, who turned to weightlifting and steroids to suppress his crippling self-esteem issues, may need a little more than flowers to win over anyone at this stage.

Generic red-nosed pub fly #2 asks if the rumours are true, and if his old man is considering coming on as a coach next season.

“Not sure what he’s up to” says the not-so-prodigal son, who has only played two matches of footy since high school, after several severe concussions that were a direct result of unwanted nepotism that saw him playing top grade football at 65 kilos.

“He might be keen on coaching. Not sure. You’d have to ask him”

Journalism Grad At News Corp Job Interview Negotiates Price Of Soul

“I understand,” he said smiling.

“So what does a normal working day involve? What are the hours?”

There was a long pause.

“We’ll get to that in a minute,” murmured the greying HR manager.

The 22-year-old South Betoota Polytechnic graduate spoke to The Advocate this morning about a job interview he had at the Diamantina Evening Tribune, the second largest Murdoch-owned major daily newspaper in the greater Betoota area.

Aside from the usual interview chit-chat and eye-rolling through his expected salary discussions, Townsend said the two representatives from that paper’s HR department wanted to negotiate the price of his soul before he expected to start.

“They asked me if I supported the Coalition’s rollout of the NBN and I said ‘yes’ – mainly because I need a job,” he said.

“Then the man asked me if I enjoyed the company of gay and non-binary people? Then there was a pause before he laughed and told me not to answer that. But he winked at me. Then he asked about gay marriage and Jesus. It was really full on,”

“At the end of it, they asked me how my living expenses were. I told them. They came back and offered me slightly above that figure each month. So according to News Corp, my soul is worth about $3300 a month before tax,”

“Would I sell out on my principles as a young person for that? You bet. At least it’s a real job.”

Townsend then asked if The Advocate would like to put in a counter offer of employment.

However, company and editorial policy dictate that one must be directly related to the Editor, Clancy Overell, to be considered for a senior position here.

CSIRO Report Unable To Conclude Where These Lighters Come From

TEXT:

Australia’s peak scientific body has lashed out at the powerful propane lighter lobby today over their continued silence regarding the origins of a certain type of lighter.

The CSIRO apologised profusely to the Australian public today in a Canberra press conference for wasting their time and money on such a fruitless endeavour.

“Two years and AUD$60m later, we still don’t know where these lighters come from,” said CSIRO researcher Paul Colon.

“Not even the guys from ASIO we have lunch with know. These lighters seem to appear from nowhere and there’s nobody in the government who can explain where they come from and who makes them,”

“I’ll be real with you, there’s more chance we find MH370 than find the source of these things.”

Tiling Sub-Contractor Opts To Squat After Politely Declining Spare Milk Crate At Smoko

TEXT:

A seemingly competent and level-headed subbie has today opted for what looks like the most uncomfortable stance during his smoko break.

While still joining the other blokes for lunch, Mike (or maybe Mark) has politely refused a spare milk crate, and opted to squat.

“Mate, you can even cut off a bit of the insulation over there if you don’t like the criss-cross of the milk crate” says the foreman, making an effort to not say either Mark or Mike.

“I’m fine” says Mike (or maybe Mark).

For someone who spends his entire working day that close to the ground, one would think that Mike (or maybe Mark) would take the chance to give his knee caps a breather, but apparently not.

While doing all the same usual smoko things that everyone else is doing, including smoking ciggies, eating sandwiches and rehydrating, Mike (or Mark?) slowly waddles like a duck to make space for other people joining the circle.

Witnesses say that maybe it’s not as uncomfortable for the tiler as it is for them because most of them are quite overweight is comparison, but still, surely you’d wanna just take a seat, seeing we only get half an hour a day to do eat lunch.

Man Able To See Just How Much His Hair Loss Has Progressed On Bus CCTV Monitor

TEXT:

Heading home from work at the end of what was an especially hard Monday, a junior lawyer has received another kick in the guts after seeing just how much his hair loss has progressed by spying himself briefly in on a bus’ CCTV monitor.

Nathan Singh, of North Betoota, said he was shocked at first by how thin he was on top but wasn’t at all surprised.

“I typically wear a hat leaving work just in case someone from the office is on my bus, I don’t want them to recognise me and feel obligated to have a chat,” said the 31-year-old.

“But today I didn’t bring one because I am an idiot. Anyway, that’s beside the point. What the point is – is that I just saw myself on the bus security monitor thing and it really took my breath away,”

“Is that what I look like from behind? I’m not ready to shave my head. Why did this happen to me? I’ve got no family history,”

He stopped himself.

“No, I don’t care. Fuck it.”

Speaking candidly to our reporter as the G34 from the Old City District wound it’s way down the hill, across the mighty Diamantina and up to the northern suburbs, Singh admitted that he was just tired and a bit emotional.

“And seeing that didn’t help,” he said.

“At least I’m not a Liverpool fan. Get a real goalie, you fucking losers!”

“But yeah, I just feel very flat and very tired. Well, I played golf on Saturday morning then had a bit of a long lunch with the fellas. I actually threw up for the first time in years that night. The guys just drink so much and so fast,”

“Next thing I know, I’m on the D46 tram to work this morning and I feel like part of me has died. I don’t think I want to sell ad space around radio shows anymore. I want to move to Africa and build schools. What the fuck am I doing with my life?”

Our reporter said he didn’t know and that he couldn’t answer that awkwardly existential question for him – only he could.

Matt shrugged and put his John Player Special out when he was only halfway through sucking it down.

“I guess I’ll have a different opinion on Friday.”

Idiot Man Fills Up On Cheese And Biscuits Before Dinner – Again

TEXT:

A torn slice of Bega cheese on a Jatz bickie is one of the most explosive flavour combinations to come out of Australia in the past decade. It’s become a staple in the diets of many a man, in particular, Toby Gallany (29), who has inadvertently had the dynamic duo for dinner since his girlfriend dumped him 5 years ago.

However, it appears Toby is still living in the past, having once again filled up on cheese and bickies, even though his new girlfriend had made him dinner.

“I don’t know what happened, we were both having a coupla cheese canapés then she went into the kitchen and when she came back it was all gone”

“I couldn’t stop”

“Obviously I lied and said I was still stinging for the 8hr slow cooked lamb she’d been slaving away at”

“But honestly, it was the last thing I felt like eating, it may as well have been cat food.”

The Advocate understands that this situation isn’t unique to Toby, with 60% of men in relationships Australia wide falling prey to this short-term fix mentality.

“It stems from the frontal lobe development” explains Dr. Fratelli, head of the CSIRO’s Soft and Hard Cheese division.

Dr. Fratelli has dedicated her entire career to investigating the effects cheese has on the adult male brain.

“It’s not pretty. People think the crack epidemic in America is bad, it’s just a blip in the radar compared to this.”

Rural Servo Really Delivering With The Bain-Marie

TEXT:

Local service station owner, Bruce Muffet, has tonight been hailed a hero, after preemptively stocking up his bain-marie with fresh crispy chicken strips, wings and God’s golden gift, potato gems.

As the drunk revelers stumbled through his sliding doors, calls of ‘you fucking beauty’ and ‘Bruce, you’ve done it again!’ Could be heard slurring out their mouths.

Humble in his fame, Bruce explained to the Advocate that it’s just good business.

“Nah, I’m no genius. You tell me what you’d do; you’ve got hundreds of pissed and hungry people leaving the pub at the same time with nowhere to get food”

“They’ll eat fucking anything”

“I saw a girl once chew the crumbling off a wing, then give the bare wing to her mate. It was disgusting.”

One particularly insistent partygoer wouldn’t have any of Bruce’s humbleness, even going as far as to tell him he loves him.

“Oh fuck, Brucey [haha] I fucking love gems. And I fucking love you. Maybe more than KFC.”

“Nah, nah, nah, don’t tell them I said that. I do love you, but.”

The Advocate understands that simply by stocking up the bain-marie, Bruce is able to make up for the fall in profits during Betoota’s offseason. According to our reports, Bruce rakes in an astounding $15,000 each weekend, from bain-marie sales alone.

Bruce has suggested that south Betoota’s Red Rooster could learn a thing or two from him, however, we suspect Red Rooster’s problem is far more deep-seeded than stocking up food.

Hungover Bushie Realises He’s Been Driving In Complete Silence For The Past 3 Hours

TEXT:

Betoota Plains cocky Hamish Palmer (28), has today had a haunting realisation.

3 hours into his 8-hour drive home, Mr. Palmer discovered that he had in fact been driving in silence the entire time.

Usually the type to listen to Luke Bryan’s greatest hits on repeat, Hamish was quite shaken by this voluntary silence – naturally leading him to further question his existence and try to figure out what the point even was any more.

Speaking to our reporter, who happened to be at the same driver reviver, Hamish explained that he thinks he may know why he began his journey devoid of audio stimulus.

“Yeah.. g’day mate.. ah.. yeah, guess you could say I had a bit on last night.” Hamish managed to get out.

According to our reporter, Hamish looked as though he had been into something a little harder than usual, having described his appearance as “a good ad for Napisan.”

“Oh.. yeah. Well me and Jim, my cousin, got stuck into a few schooners at the tavern. Then, you know, one thing lead to another and, ah, had a bit of a sesh [sic] on the chalk dust”

“Now I’m here, having just drove in silence for 3 hours. What the fuck is wrong with me?”

Unable to answer Hamish’s question, our reporter gave him 3 Panadol, a Snickers and, before sending him on his way, ensured he had all Luke Bryan’s 5 albums lined up in Spotify to play for the remaining 5 hours.

OPINION: Why Jeff, The Purple Wiggle, Is Problematic For Narcoleptics Like Me

TEXT:

I was only nine when people started calling me Jeff.

For so long, I wondered why I’d drift off to sleep in class or in the playground at lunch. No matter how much sleep I got the night before, it made little difference.

So they called me Jeff.

It wasn’t until I was much older that a diagnosis of narcolepsy allowed me to understand and confront my problems. At last, I had a reason why I was the way I was. I was set free.

Regardless, they called me Jeff after the purple Wiggle, who kept falling asleep inappropriately and was the target of laughter and much ridiculed.

Though I tried to laugh along with them, tried to let the insults and name-calling slide off my back like pikelets off a spatula – I couldn’t.

What really hurt was that they, my teachers and bullies, began spelling my name like his, without the G and the O.  I was named after my father and the fact that my bullies and teachers disrespected that fact killed me inside.

Jeff The Purple Wiggle is responsible for a lot of pain in my childhood – and I’m not alone.

Thousands of juvenile narcoleptics just like me faced the same fate which is why in 2018, the purple Wiggle is problematic.

We are all Jeffs.

But as fate would have it, Jeff himself was diagnosed with a heart condition and mild narcolepsy.

A tragic twist in the curious case of me.

We need to move on as a society in the wake of this. We are better than this.

My name is Geoff.

Bartender Immediately Regrets Asking Farmer How Things Are Going

TEXT:

RSL bartender Merl Evers (45) had to stay late at work last night after asking local farmer Geoff Trainer (66) how things are going, a decision she immediately regretted after Trainer began giving a detailed and honest answer.

Despite the fact Evers has become a much-loved staple of Betoota RSL, but even with a quarter century of bartending experience, she forgot the first rule of regional bartending.

“Never ask a farmer how things are going,” stated a baggy-eyed Evers.

“Because they will tell you. Oh yes. They will tell you.”

CCTV footage shows Trainer entering Betoota RSL at 7:34 pm where he promptly ordered a jug of beer. Evers confirmed to police it was during this time she made the mistake of asking Trainer how his day was.

“Immediately he told me how he’s been crook lately and that his back is fucked again after he had to bury a dozen head of cattle he lost in a thunderstorm all by hand because his tractor had broken down and his son can’t come round to fix it because he’s too caught up trying to marry up the big shot neighbour’s daughter.”

“I honestly thought things were going pretty good for these old cockys”  

According to Evers, her attempts to serve other customers did nothing to stop Trainer from continuing to treat the bartender as an under-qualified therapist while consuming $212 worth of piss.

Due to lacking the social skills to move Trainer along, Merl was forced to listen to the weather-beaten farmer for the remainder of the shift and for an additional two hours after it finished.

“He kept plodding on about how he’s never going to be able to retire. I felt like fucking retiring after 30 seconds of listening to him. You know he didn’t ask once how I’ve been?”

Evers was able to escape the conversation by going to the toilet and squeezing out through the narrow side window, losing a shoe in the process, before running home without looking back or stopping once.

CCTV footage then shows that Trainer made his way to the VIP room where he then lost $450 on Queen of the Nile, which is somehow listed as a tax write off.

“I look forward to hearing him whinge about that next time then.”

According to Trainer, Evers is an old soul that understands farmers are doing it tough and sometimes all they need is a keen ear to listen.

“Shee’s a good bloke Merl, she’s an old soul,” stated Geoff Trainer as he checked the quality of his dwindling water supply.

“I was thinking about Merl the other day and I realised she’s probably my best friend. Specially [sic] since I lost Rex, my German Shepard, to a Taipan last week. Funny story how I got him actually, as a puppy mind you, I was driving to Mackay with my brother Lenny, God rest him, and we saw this guy holding a sign about 200ks out of Rocky where there used to be this big ice-cream shop…”

“Don’t You Fucken Tell Your Mother” Says Dad After Being Caught Sucking A Dart Out Back

TEXT:

Local dad, Choc Liston (57) has today made it clear that he’s willing to do whatever is necessary to protect himself from the wrath of his wife, Gabby.

After allegedly quitting cigarettes a couple years ago, Choc’s second-oldest, Rory, has caught the old back out the back of the family home hoeing into a lungbuster,

“Busted!” yelled the 16-year-old Rory, taking full advantage of one of those rare opportunities where it’s not him that’s in shit.

“Back on the smokes aye big fella?!”

Choc, while both startled and furious at being caught, is quick to compose himself.

“Oi” he says.

“Come ‘ere”

Rory, unsure whether his dad is about to clip his ear for carrying on, or give him a cigarette to have himself, slowly makes his way over.

“Don’t you fucken tell your mother” says the old man.

Rory, who is in peak smart-arse mode as a dimwitted year 11 student, flippantly responds.

“Yeah. Because you’re busted!”

Choc, who is quite visibly seething at the possibility of being held ransom by the runt of his litter, makes an ultimatum.

“You’ll keep your mouth shut if you know what’s good for you”

Rory senses that his dad might have a bit of ammo.

“What… What do you mean?”

Choc begins wheeling the situation back into his control.

“I found the folder on your mothers laptop you little fucking grub”

“You know she uses that for work?”

“You want me to let her know what kind of videos you’ve got saved in ‘Maths Homework’? Does that sound like something you’d like to discuss with your own mother”

Rory, acutely aware of how fucked he is, lowers his head and takes the L.

“Now fuck off you little shit”

Liberal Use Of The C-Bomb Around Office Suggests Female Colleague Might As Well Be Invisible

TEXT:

She’s not asking for much, just a little bit of decorum during business hours.

A junior asset manager at Bell Potter’s South Betoota office has spoken candidly to The Advocate this after about some of the language her coworkers use day-to-day.

And from what she told us, it’s far, far from professional.

“It’s almost like I’m invisible,” said Alex Gillies, who took time out of her busy afternoon working for the McDonalds of private wealth management firms, to chat with our reporter about one word in particular.

“Like, I hear that work nine to ten times a day. C-word this, c-word that. That bloke’s a c-word. Why is our boss such a c-word. I’m fucking sitting right here, guys. Can you fucking control yourself? Every time I hear that word, it’s like someone slipped an ice cube down the back of my blouse,”

“Am I being unreasonable? Do I sound like a bitch? Maybe I’m being too much of a prude? It’s 2018 after all and I guess I should just learn to use the word as flippantly as all the other pigs in my department with their weak jawlines and scuffed pleather loafers in the name of equality? Nah, fuck that.”

Our reporter reached out to Govin Simmons, who’s been working alongside Alex for close to a year now.

After a short five minute conversation with him, it was clear to The Advocate that he was one of the main c-word slingers around the office.

“I’ve got this tired old c–t of a client who keeps ringing me to ask how much exposure his portfolio has to medicinal cannabis stocks. Like fucking chill, c–t. I’ll get you your 10%,” he said, to our female reporter.

With that, our reporter got up and gave a knowing nod to Alex and walked out without saying goodbye.

“Rent Is Dead Money” Says 28-Year-Old Bag Of Shit Still Living At Home

TEXT:

With a copy of Barefoot Investor tucked under his arm, Danny Cartwright joined our reporter this afternoon at a popular French Quarter cafe to talk about the outdated social construct of leaving the family home at 18.

“Rent is dead money,” he said.

“I don’t see any point in it. Why give your money to someone else?”

While the 28-year-old concedes that when he tells people he still lives at home, the conversation lulls until somebody changes the subject – but he doesn’t care.

Our reporter asked if he was saving for a house or even a deposit, to which the four-acre-foreheaded youngster replied, ‘no.’

“I don’t think you understand,” said Danny.

“Renting is dead money. When I go overseas and experience new cultures and whatnot, it’s not dead money. It’s the opposite, in fact. I’m just lucky Mum and Dad don’t mind me living at home still. They don’t even make me chip in for bills, for some reason unbeknown to me!”

“Plus, if I moved out to some Old City District slum, Mum would worry about me.”

Cartwright went on to describe his parent’s home up in the leafy, exclusive enclave of Betoota Grove.

He told our reporter that his room is the old self-contained guestroom which sits atop the garage.

“When Dad starts to mower at like 7 in the morning on a Sunday, it can get bit testy. Especially if I’m hungover. Once I lost it and called him a fuck head from my bedroom window. He came running up the stairs with a length of poly pipe and flogged me with it until I started crying. Still better than being a rentcuck!”

The Advocate reached out to Danny’s father for comment and received a short but to-the-point reply.

“I have created a monster,” he said.

“Renting isn’t dead money when it keeps you from sleeping in a park. Fuck it, I’ll kick him out and see how he goes!”

“I’m interested to see how he’d fair by himself in the real world.”

Bloke Wonders How Battler Paying Fare With Cash Functions On A Day-To-Day Level

TEXT:

A dishevelled city worker hailed the G34 bus up the hill to Betoota Heights tonight and proceeded to pay the $3.20 fare with an assortment of silver coins, according to a popular structural engineer.

Lucas Patel stood in awe at Jake Mullins, who held the bus up for close to ninety seconds while he tried to get the change together in his hand.

“You’d think he’d just be a tourist here or something, or a visiting businessman, wouldn’t you?” said Lucas.

“But no, he’s not. I know him and he’s lived in Betoota his whole life. He plays for the Dolphins and the Dugongs. He’s Jake Mullins,”

“Which makes me wonder why he hasn’t got a PelicanPass. Everybody in town has one. You basically need one to get the MetroLine and the tram. How does he manage his life? I want to know how he functions on a day to day level. Does he use coins to pay the gas bill?”

However, as much as Lucas’ curiosity got the better of him, our reporter phoned Jake shortly after concluding the interview with Mr Patel.

The Advocate got to the bottom of the storm.

“Fuck getting the bus, bruz,” he said.

“I make a great salary. I’ve got no kids, no wife, no mortgage. There’s no excuse why I shouldn’t have a deadly whip sitting in my drive,”

“My car broke down and I couldn’t be fucked walking up the hill. The bus was coming and I thought, ‘Fuck it, why not? Why not live a little and get the bus like some paid-by-the-month-Tarocash-cuck?’ so I just got on and the bloke asked me for money. And here we are,”

Our reporter considered the matter closed.

Tight-Knit Office Team Go On Pretending They Haven’t All Slept With Each Other

TEXT:

Though most of the town’s small brewing community know, the sales and accounts team down at Betoota United Breweries have gone on another day pretending like they haven’t all slept with each other before.

Queensland sales manager, Sandra Stevens, has confided in The Advocate this afternoon saying that by living under the illusion that she’s never gone all the way with two of the three men in her department is better for everyone involved.

“That and I know Tom, the PNG sale rep, has probably slept with every woman who’s been through the front arches of the brewery. He’s the biggest slut I’ve ever met. Yuck! Let’s not go there. Anyway, we just go on pretending like we’ve never done it with one another. Even if you asked me, I couldn’t really draw it out. But yeah, I reckon if you put all six of us on a sheet of paper and drew in the connections,”

“It’d look like a mighty fine spider web. That’s for sure.”

When asked whether she thinks it’s either beneficial or detrimental to the office productivity and work environment, Stevens said she was impartial.

She explained to our reporter that it’s not as if they’re living like it’s the last days of Rome down at Betoota United, it’s simply the ease and proximately the team are to vast amounts of basically free alcohol.

“You could walk into any pub and club around here and you’d see the same thing,”

“Honestly, it is what it is. It’s easier to just go on and act like it never happened. It’s not like we’re hurting anyone. If you catch feelings, you can always ride it out until it inevitably goes to shit and somebody has to resign. Tell me that ain’t living?”

Dad Lowkey Excited To Hear What His Son’s Done After Receiving Call From Principal

TEXT:

Going about his busy business yesterday afternoon, a local father fielded a phone call from his son’s principal – asking him to come in and see her when he came to pick his boy up.

“I was actually quite excited to hear what the little bastard had done this time, I must admit,” said Betoota Heights lawyer, Michael Scarce.

“Not the first time my phone’s rung and young John’s principal was on the other end of the line. Not that I condone what he’s done, I’m just curious as to what he’s done. As if you wouldn’t be,”

“As long as it isn’t something weird or a giant red flag, like he’s shit somewhere he wasn’t supposed to – or been a bit too rough with another kid, I don’t mind.”

Scarce said he arrived at the school shortly after 3:20pm yesterday and double parked out the front like the selfish cunt his first wife says he is.

As the clock struck half past, a steady and constant stream of children flowed from the corridors and fire escapes of Remienko Memorial Primary School – all except John – who was in the purgatory between the school’s reception and the principal’s office.

Principal Patricia Illes stood on the stoop of the library and nodded as she made eye contact with Michael – as if to say come this way.

Seeing his son for the first time, Michael did he best not to smile as they walked from reception into the office.

“Wait out here, John,” said Patricia.

She and Michael walked into her office and shut the door.

“Thank you for making the time to come in, Mr Scarce,” she said.

“No worries, bunji. What’s he done this time?”

Patricia looked down at the table and took a breath as Michael forced a frown.

“He and a few boys were playing in the cricket nets at lunchtime and when it was John’s turn to bowl, he came in hot around the wicket and bowled a seemingly purposeful full toss straight at the batsman,”

“As yes, the old Doug Jardine. Against the spirit of the game but legal none the less,” he said.

“However, they were using a tennis ball but John thought it’d be a good idea to use a Granny Smith apple instead,” she said.

“I see. Did John hurt the kid, did he?” he said.

“He was allergic to apples, the kid he bowled it to. There’s a blanket ban on apples, nuts, honey, cocaine, and white bread here at Remienko. Rules have been broken and there needs to be a punishment.”

“Yes, there must be a punishment. Should I throw his Nintendo Wii sticks up on the roof or something?”

“He’s being internally suspended for a week.”

“Right.”

“You can go now Mr Scarce.”

“Thank you.”

“Usain Bolt Is Such A Sellout” Says Creative Who Definitely Wouldn’t Sell Out Given The Chance

TEXT:

A barman at a popular Old City District cocktail bar cursed with a creative mind has lashed out at Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt for selling out to the highest bidder.

Jerry Palmer also took potshots at Optus, who paid millions for the fastest man in the world’s endorsement which has seen his face featured prominently in television and display advertising.

“I think it’s pathetic,” he said.

“Taking money from a company like Optus goes against his own principles and it reeks of a cash grab. He shouldn’t be allowed to profit off his image, only off his talents as an athlete,”

“When I become a famous author, a famously reclusive author I should add, I’d never sell out like that. Money isn’t everything, you know. Money can’t buy your soul back, Usain. Remember that.”

But those close to Jerry say that’s not categorically correct.

His manager at the Frotting Bjelke Bar on Collins Street said that Jerry, who’s a prominent member of the South Betoota Polytechnic College Marxist Society, jumped at the opportunity to work tomorrow’s public holiday in Queensland because of the penalty rates.

“We’re only going to be open for a few hours tomorrow night but at double time, Jerry said he could really do with the extra dosh,” said Amy Stevens, manager of the bar.

“If he wears one of his hammer and sickle shirts to work tomorrow, I’ll just die. The irony would kill me. If what you’re telling me is true, that Jerry would never sell out given the chance? That’s not true,”

“Everybody sells out. If you don’t sell out, you’ll be begging for a weeknight off from work from work for the rest of your life.”

Finally A Bubbler With A Bit Of Fucken Go About It

TEXT:

A lovely stroll in the park has been topped off today, by a water fountain with a strong enough stream to avoid face on steel contact.

It is reportedly a world first for the local council, who up until this exact moment had not shown any interest in their public use taps and bubblers.

”This one is perfect” says local picnicker, Wendy Ireland (55).

”Just far enough away from the ground so the dogs can’t piss on it”

“And finally one with a bit of fucking go about it”

This comes after a recent study by the CCC that found 9 in town public use bubblers are so piss weak they usually leave citizens sucking from the spout, forfeiting any sense of hygiene and self respect.

However, this particular bubbler in the park has done a lot for stigma surrounding council utilities, and is restoring faith in the system.

”It takes you back to when you first remember using a bubbler in primary school” says 90-year-old Berryl Wagstaff.

”It’s seriously quite an impressive stream. I usually don’t even bother with these things anymore”

At time of press, our reporters were seen having a good ol’ drink from the fountain in question, because that’s what it’s therefore, right?

Kanye’s Highly-Publicised Downward Spiral A Key Indicator That New Album Drop Imminent

TEXT:

A number of local music pundits have concluded that the amount of press US rapper/producer Kanye West is currently receiving is a key indicator that a new album will hit shelves shortly.

Claire Beatty, the bubbly day duty manager of South Betoota’s third-largest Sanity store, took time out of her busy afternoon of restocking the Fleetwood Mac and Eagles CDs to explain just why she thinks a new Kanye album is about to arrive.

“Just look at what he’s saying,” said the 27-year-old student.

“He told a crowd at Madison Square Garden that he would’ve voted for Donald Trump while he stood above them on a platform saying that he was a God just ten minutes earlier,”

“Then he does this latest round of interviews where he says very, very controversial things about everything from slavery to Taylor Swift. He opens his mouth and headlines come out – then people click on those headlines,”

“The people who click on those headlines then become the people that click buy when the album finally comes out. It’s simple. I like his as much as the next rapper, I even liked Tay-Tay’s cover of ‘September’ by that disco band that everybody was supposed to hate. I’m just saying… In the seldomly wise words of Micheal ‘Pup’ Clarke, ‘get ready for a new fucking album.'”

However, some in Betoota’s small music journalism community has said this album needs to stand head and shoulders about the rest of his work to make them forget about all the horrible things he’s said.

Speaking via telephone with our reporter, Sam Simpson, of Betoota Heights HMV explained that like most of his Twitter feed, he’s decided to move Kayne into the basket of people he doesn’t like.

“I don’t think he can come back from this. He’s gone and supported Trump,” he said.

“Which is basically career suicide. Look at Clint Eastwood. He voted for Trump and he hasn’t directed a movie since January. He won’t direct another one, either. I know that this is just all a cry for media attention and whatnot but I think he’s gone too far,”

“Which means this next album, whenever it drops, it will flop and the world will move on. Seriously, I’m a freelance music journalist, listen to me.”

Local Band Takes To Social Media To Announce That They Have A Big Announcement Coming Up

TEXT:

A popular Betoota-based rock band that has been doing big things, has today announced that they’ve got something big to announce, real soon.

After two years on the pub circuit, The Squad Of Geriatrics have been slowly climbing the barely visible or identifiable ranks that make up the of the Australian music industry.

Today it looks like they might be near the top, if there is one.

“Hey guys,

Thanks to all of you who came out to our show in Bedourie last night. We loved playing for you guys.

Stay tuned, big announcement coming up this arvo at around 3pm (QLD)”

It is not yet known what the announcement will be about, but many fans are guessing at it being something related to a new tour. Either that or they are going to be announcing a new video, which probably wouldn’t require three separate Facebook posts.

Ever since the conception of ‘band pages’ on social media, pre-big-announcement-announcements has become quite common in Australian rock/alt-rock circles, as musicians no longer have to rely on industry magazines or publicists to ‘get the word out’.

“It’s really helped us” says SOG lead singer, Sarah.

“Especially as a band with females in it. We can actually organically grow without having to wear low neckline tops like the promoters keep suggesting”

When asked what was up next for the band, Sarah told us to check Facebook at 3PM like everyone else.

ABC Employee Treats Himself To New Pair Of Trainers And Baggy Bootcut Jeans

TEXT:

A local ABC producer has thrown common sense and caution to the wind this afternoon by treating himself to a new pair of ‘snazzy’ joggers and some jeans that one could pitch a tent with.

Oscar Cleary, who shot to local fame in 2011 after having his new Nike TN sneakers ripped from his feet by some hoods in a brazen broad daylight attack at a Betoota Heights petrol station, paid a visit to Remienko Memorial Shopping Plaza this afternoon to handpick a new below-the-belly-button outfit.

He said the biggest problem was choosing the right colour trainer.

“I wanted one that wasn’t going to blind you and one that wasn’t blue enough to blend in with the jeans, that’d look pretty stupid,” he said.

“So I ended up going with a pair of jet-black Clarks that the nice man at the shop said I could use for the gym and jogging if I wanted. That means I only really need one pair of shoes! [laughs] Seriously, though. Good value,”

“The jeans are also about six sizes too big for my ass. I could fit two 1kg bags of chicken wings down the back of them at Woolies, which I’ve been known to do. Yum yum apple plum, get in my tum! [laughs] Only kids pay for their chicken wings. Anyway, I’ve got to get back to work.”

The 34-year-old mingling single French Quarter resident produces the popular ‘Afternoons with Peter Heroin‘ on ABC Channel Country which is known for its hard rock and thumping metal playlists.

Peter is well-known locally for being found slumped over the steering wheel of his early-model Toyota Corona in 2011 after coming down with a ‘mystery illness’ while at work – that was later found to be ‘heroin’.

Coupled with long hours on his feet actually doing something in return for our taxpayer dollars, Oscar says his choice in footwear is important and critical for his job performance.

That and the dry desert heat makes ‘looking fashionable’ a second thought.

“I’ve gone the white New Balance and blue jean combo in the past and received negative reviews. Even from perfect strangers. They stop me on the street and ask what’s wrong with me,”

“But ker-serah serah [sic] Whatever. They’ll be laughing when I’m retired at 65 wearing the exact same thing!”

First Text Message In Weeks Only From Telco Saying Local Dork Has Gone Over Data Limit

TEXT:

A remarkably unpopular South Betoota shift worker felt compelled to write to The Advocate this morning with his own personal tale of woe.

Dennis Peterson, who works nights unloading cargo at Diamantina Air Freight on the north end of the airport, said he thought he was hearing things when he heard his message tone trill out from the next room.

“I thought, who could that be?” he said.

“I don’t have any friends. Not any friends that text me, anyway. I’ve got friends online but they haven’t got my mobile number, that’s for sure. So I was genuinely surprised and excited to see who it was,”

“At first, I thought it was Mum checking up on me to see if I was still alive but it was far, far less cool than that. It was from Telstra to say I’d gone over my data limit.”

And with that, the 29-year-old shrugged and sighed.

“It could’ve been worse. It could’ve been the ATO saying I’d claimed too much on my laundry last year or something. I claim sunscreen because I work outside. They don’t know it’s exclusively at night.”

Never-the-less, young Dennis says he’s able to see the bright side of this seriously, unabridged depressing situation.

“It could’ve been work asking me to come in early! [laughs] Don’t you hate it when that happens?”

North QLD Man Disgusted With Self After Eating Whole Box Of Krispy-Kremes On Flight Home

TEXT:

A Townsville man has confessed to inhaling twelve Krispy-Kreme doughnuts which he purchased at Brisbane Airport shortly before he flew out this afternoon.

Francis Dollarhyde, a defence contractor and junior rugby league coach, purchased the sweet treats for his family as a treat.

However, somewhere over Mackay, the temptation proved to be too much.

“I had two at the gate waiting to board,” he told The Advocate via telephone this afternoon.

“Even that kinda made me feel disappointed in myself. But I was so hungry. I got on the beers last night with some Brisbane mates and I was really in the midst of a sugar crash. Coupled with being uncomfortably hungover, I just caved,”

“There I was in row B in the middle, just scoffing these Krispy-Kremes while my row-mates looked on in horror. A bit rolled out of the side of my gob and onto this blokes arm. Before he could say anything, I just reached down and picked it right up then ate it. Jesus fucking wept, what the hell is the matter with me.”

A hostess aboard the flight, who’d even taken extra care with Mr Dollarhyde as to accommodate the Krispy-Kremes to make sure they didn’t get crushed, was also visibly appalled by the event.

Upon landing in Townsville some 30 minutes ago, he only had a few short minutes to dispose of the evidence before his family would see him at the baggage carousel.

“I panicked and just left the box on the seat,” he said.

“The hosties were already staring daggers at me so I doubled down and just said ‘fuck it’,”

“I might as well chop my bronze frequent flyer card up now. They’ve got a cross next to my name now for sure.”

Former Reality TV Star Wishes She Could Go To Local Sizzler And Not Be Recognised

TEXT:

The South Betoota Sizzler has been home to great fun family times for generations – all at an affordable price.

From children’s birthdays to a brooding teen’s graduation, there’s seldom an occasion where a trip to the institutional franchise isn’t appropriate.

But not everybody in the community can visit the salad bar or load themselves up on dessert without a fear of being interrupted and ultimately judged.

Tuesday Coyne, 27, hasn’t been able to visit the South Betoota Sizzler since she shot to national fame back in 2014 as a prospective wife on Farmer Wants A Wife.

“It’s only ever at Sizzler I get recognised and it’s ruining my life,” she told The Advocate.

“Back when the show was actually on, it couldn’t go anywhere. Some bitch from New Idea said I tried to give Farmer Dan an over-the-pants handjob, which wasn’t true, and the next article said that when I eventually got bushed by Dan, I threw a pot of DOT 4 brake fluid over his Hilux in revenge,”

“That part about the car was kind of true. It was power steering oil but none-the-less, I was a prisoner in my own home. Sizzler is the worst though, I could be helping myself to some hearty potato salad one minute, then some chinless pig of a man in an HRT singlet would say something crass at me,”

“Which is why Hogs Breath gets my business now. They understand the concept of privacy and everyone leaves me alone. I guess Hogs Breath people are just a bit more sophisticated?”

The Advocate reached out to the management down at the South Betoota Sizzler and was able to speak briefly with the franchise manager, Gussy Maitland.

He was able to outline that there is a protocol for handling celebrities in the restaurant but ultimately concedes that their response hasn’t been good enough this time.

“We’re sorry to hear that Ms Coin has had a negative experience at one of our family restaurants. We do try to keep a certain level of decorum, especially around the salad bar.  We’ve extended an apology to Ms Coyne and have assured her that the incident was isolated and she’s welcome back any time.”

Tuesday has indicated that she won’t be returning to the Sizzler any time soon.

Work Water Bottle Enters 100th Day Of Refilling Without A Wash

TEXT:

Louise Franklin was feeling pretty good about herself as she took a big sip of water from the water bottle that’s permanently left on her desk at work. But as one bird-like coworker pointed out, Louise’s water bottle would be giving her a lot more than some good quality H2O – given it’s entering its 100th day of use without a wash.

“Do you know how much bacteria would be in that thing?” Sourly questioned Sally, the stickybeak coworker.

As our reporter was not aware of how much bacteria had chosen to make their breeding ground on Louise’s water bottle, we reached out to H2O and micro-organism expert, Douglas Waters, to gain some key insights into this nationwide pandemic.

“We’ve actually just completed a fascinating study into water bottle bacteria. Based on the 12 water bottles we tested, we found that reusable drinking containers may be crawling with an alarming number of viable bacteria cells: more than 300,000 colony-forming units per square centimeter (CFU/sqcm)”

“So, for the laymen, that means you might as well be drinking from your dog’s food bowl” Douglas said while chuckling at his own sass.

Upon learning these alarming facts, the Advocate reached out to Louise to inform her of the potentially deadly habit she’s got into, however stickybeak Sally has informed us that Louise is now in hospital with E. coli.

Waters suggested that if people want to avoid E. coli and other water-bottle-born breakouts they must simply stop drinking water, or if they must drink water, purchase a single use plastic water bottle and then discard it after one use.

Man Finally Able To Go Back To Buying Caged Eggs After Girlfriend Leaves Him

TEXT:

She took the flat, the dog and the late model Toyota they went halves in but today, Mike Procter says he’s finally had a win.

Back living with mates of mates in a French Quarter share house, the 28-year-old auditor at KPMG’s South Betoota Office told The Advocate that he’s enjoying the newfound ‘micro-freedoms’ which have now returned to his life.

“I can finally buy caged eggs again,” he said.

“You can get a dozen for like three bucks. When Lucy was still around, I had to get the fucking eggs with the photos of green rolling hills and happy chickens on them. These ones I just bought are just plain cardboard with black text on it,”

“I also got full-fat milk and a deck of John Player Specials. I haven’t had a cigarette for like four years. Lucy made me quit around Sochi [Winter Olympics], I think. I loved smoking. Now I can do and eat all the things I couldn’t do when Lucy wasn’t in control of my fucking life, man. I sat down in the shower this morning and had a beer. I’ve finally got my old life back.”

However, some of Mike’s friends have expressed their concerns over his apparent downward spiral.

Speaking candidly to our reporter, Lewis Huxtable of Betoota Heights explained that he’s known Mike for a number of years and that this self-destructive behaviour has him worried.

“It’s not about the eggs,” he said.

“It’s never been about the eggs. But I guess we all go through these types of things differently. I mean, he thinks all these small freedoms returning to his life is a good thing. I reckon he wasn’t allowed to do these things, like having a can of heavy in the shower at 9am and eating unethically sourced food because it was bad for him,”

“But anyway, I feel bad about Lucy taking the dog. He needs time to grieve for that. He was a great dog.”

RSA Marshall Stalks Next Victim

TEXT:

One of the three Responsible Service of Alcohol Marshalls surveying the odd thousand revellers spilling out into the Dolphins Leagues Club car park this afternoon is currently looking for his next day to ruin.

Brett Goodiman, of Betoota Ponds, said he’s already thrown ten blokes out for showing signs of intoxication and “that’s only the start” according to the well-built 47-year-old.

“At the moment, I’m stalking this bloke in a red shirt who’s been shouting quite loudly and using obscene language,” he told our reporter.

“That’s him over there, you see? I’ve already instructed the bar staff not to serve him but it looks like his mates are feeding him beers, which presents a problem,”

“I could just let it go and hope he wakes up to himself and leaves to get something to eat but it doesn’t look like it. Even though there are no families here and it’s basically just the football club and their mates out the back here, I think he presents a significant risk to himself and those around him,”

“He’s got to go.”

Our reporter then observed the former armed guard and a colleague put in motion a classic pincer manoeuvre – seen in pubs and clubs around the country.

One bouncer moved in down the western fence while another moved directly toward the man in the red shirt.

Goodiman moved like a snake through the stubble and confronted the red shirt man, who knew the jig was up.

So he pushed Brett in the chest and began scaling the chainlink fence behind him, kicking a bouncer in the throat who tried to pull him down.

With one last loud battle cry and a cheer from the crowd, the man in the red shirt disappeared into the Jones Avenue lignum swamp and is currently wanted by the South Betoota Police Force.

“I Was Up $600 In Two-Up But Lost It All” Says Mate

TEXT:

A recent survey into mateship has found that every single mate you will ever make at some point will come up to you at an ANZAC Day celebration and say they’ve been up on the Two-Up – but are now down.

Case in point lies with three happy-go-lucky young men from the north-west suburbia of Betoota Heights – who’ve each separately told our reporter down at the Dolphins Leagues Club that they’ve been up $600 at some point today but have since lost it all.

Jacob Mulligan, of Wallaroy Road, said that he turned $50 into a week’s pay.

“Easy come, easy go,” he said.

“I was up around $600 but now that’s all in the pocket of that Army bloke over there from Pine Gap,”

“Hope he puts it to good use. Better stay away from those pokies. There’s no skill in a poker machine, you see. In two-up, it’s all about skill. You eyeball the bloke and you can almost tell from the outset that you’ll beat them. Bugger the coins, it’s all in a bloke’s eyes.”

Equally as unlucky was Phil Rutland, who was arm in arm with young Mulligan as he spoke to The Advocate.

He too was up around $600 but is now back to nothing.

“Yeah, bunji. Could’ve bought myself two new Mickey Thompson Bajas for the Hilux with that kind of money. Now I’ve got to see my cousin again at Bob Jane for a roadworthy – hope he doesn’t mind I’m running slicks [laughs[”

“Yeah, but nah, boorie. Today is a grouse day. A day for mates. Get around us, put that recorder down and get your wallet out, you big husky son-of-a-bitch!”

Our reporter did so.

Man Drought Prolonged By The Standard Of Human Local Woman Finds On Dating Apps

TEXT:

“All of his profile pictures are hunting pictures,” she said.

“One of them was a feral cat that looked like it’d been run over by a lawnmower. What the fuck is wrong with people? And why do they think that’d be a good idea to put those pictures up on social media?”

“Seriously, though. This town, I swear to God. The abstract concept of a man drought is inherently flawed but mother of God, there’s not much out there, is there?”

Lucy Cottonwood met our reporter in a popular – but not too popular cafe in the French Quarter to tell The Advocate about the purported ‘man drought’ that’s apparently holding the women of our desert republic to ransom.

The successful small-businesswoman explained that she first downloaded a few dating apps ‘just to see what’s out there’ before filling out the rest of her profile a few weeks later.

What the headstrong Taurus found failed to impress.

“I think the supposed ‘man drought’ out here in Betoota has got more to do with the standard of bloke out here than the scarcity,”

“Look, I’m as picky as the next 29-year-old but there is a certain level of self-respect I hold myself to. I could drink all the mango wine in Port Douglas and I still wouldn’t look at any of these blokes twice.”

To prove her point, Lucy flicked through a few dating profiles with our reporter just to outline and provide context to her opinions.

“Look at this bloke,” she said.

“Shawn. Here’s Shawn with a pig he’s just stabbed to death with the help of a few dogs. I know they’re pests and all but fuck me dead, just shoot them in the head or something. But if you’ve got the bloodlust, how about don’t take pictures? Or don’t put them on the internet?”

“At this point, it’s looking like New Farm or bust for me. I can’t live out here in the sticks anymore. I don’t care if I end up with a bloke who still has his mother Napisan his moleskins every Thursday night. As long as he doesn’t chew tobacco and wear a bullet necklace.”

Bloke You Haven’t Seen Since 2007 Lost His Phone So Contact Him On Facey If You Need To

TEXT:

Alex Kambouris is one of those guys you kind of knew at high school and kind of got on well but that’s pretty much where it ended.

Even though you haven’t seen him since 2007 and have only heard his name brought up in conversations several times since then, he’s still contactable through social media if you need to get him.

It seems the sales rep at a prominent sign printing company in your home town had a bad run on the weekend, and it looks like he lost his phone, no idea how.

As a result, Kambouris (27) has taken to Facebook to notify all of his followers that he is only contactable on the platform for the foreseeable future.

Despite the fact that he hasn’t taken a call from his friends in the past two weeks, and the overwhelming majority of his communication with anyone outside of work and his parents takes place on Facebook or other social media platforms, Alex felt it was necessary to make a public announcement.

“Aw look, I just thought I would let people know just in case anyone is trying to give me a buzz,” he told one of our reporters.

“And I guess it doesn’t make me look like a little bit of a loose unit you know. Provides me with the opportunity to do the whole, “I don’t actually even know where I lost it,” spiel.”

“Anyway, do you any of you know how to install apps on this fucking iPad, I can’t remember my Apple ID” he said.

Alison Lisik, a school friend of Black’s who hasn’t seen him since Christmas, told The Advocate that she was thankful for the update, and would definitely take note.

“Yeah, it’s great to know. Imagine if for some reason I tried to call him, and couldn’t get through. I would be rocked, so now at least I am not in for any nasty surprises,” she said.

“Do You Ride Kangaroos To School?” Asks American Who Somehow Never Got Shot In School

TEXT:

A visiting American tourist sack back in his chair last night at the Betoota Dolphin’s Leagues Club and wryly asked his new local friends if they rode kangaroos to school.

Max Sterling, originally from Portland in Oregon, is visiting friends in Betoota Heights that he met last year during the famous Calgary Stampede in British Columbia.

Now finding himself in the heart of the desert capital, the 34-year-old couldn’t resist a cultural jibe.

However, the answer he got for the absurd and downright disrespectful question was more than he’d bargained for.

“Nah, boorie. We don’t ride kangaroos to school here,” said Angus Peterwell, night manager of the popular family-orientated club.

He just happened to be walking past.

“Just like you didn’t get shot going to school. It’s a bit of a myth that’s been perpetuated and so on. Personally, I got the D45 bus to school and back each day. Lewis over there used to walk because he lived just up the road,”

“You see Annie over there beside the bain marie? Her old girl used to drive her to school because they lived out on the edge of town. No marlus, joog.”

From what had been a quiet conversation, your typical run-of-the-mill-post-bistro-Sunday-roast-chit-chat erupted into something a bit more intense.

Rather than turn the banter mirror back onto Angus, as per the local custom, Max raised his voice and began to make a scene.

“You don’t know what you’re talking about, bro,” he shouted.

“These are our kids dying, dude. You can just stand there and say those things and expect me to just take it, bro. I can’t believe you just said that. I’ll fucking fight you, bro, I’m not even joking right now,”

“Don’t joke about that shit. I’m just trying to have a laugh with you.”

Using his responsible service of alcohol training for the first time ever, Angus was able to defuse the situation and get everybody calmed down.

“I’ll give you another jug of Hanh Super Dry Mid and soda if you’ll calm down, mate.”

“I’m Doing Dry May” Says City Worker Currently Experiencing Grog Horrors

TEXT:

Though the symptoms pass with each passing minute, a young man who does things in an office with a computer during the week has tried telling himself that he’s going to make a change.

The change Peter Durkin is going to change is his alcohol intake.

However, he concedes that the idea is more of a dream than reality at the moment.

“I have the grog horrors real bad,” said the lifeless 26-year-old.

“I know that I didn’t do anything bad. I know I didn’t say anything especially spicey or make a cunt of myself,”

“But that doesn’t help me shake this impending feeling of doom. I can’t help but think I’ve gone off the rails last night and everybody hates me now. It’s ridiculous to think, but it’s consuming me right now. I don’t know what to do.”

But he says now that there is something he can do.

“I’m going to do Dry May. I’m not going to drink for a whole month,” he said.

“That should fix it. But I don’t know to socialise, especially with my work ‘friends’ without the aid of Mr Carlton or Mrs Yellowtail,”

“Never the less, I guess I’ll see how I go.”

The move has been lauded by his local GP, Dr Amanda Porter.

The popular Betoota Heights medical professional has told The Advocate that keeping away from the booze is great for your health – and that’s about it.

“Peter should notice his skin getting clearer, the whites of his eyes shouldn’t be a sickly shade of yellow anymore,” said the doctor.

“The grog horrors will go away entirely but he will become a boring cunt and probably won’t get invited anyway anymore. I reckon he should just remember to eat a big meal first, stick to midstrength beer and maybe even retire to the disable toilet to have a big old chunder if he feels his feet start to lift off the ground,”

“That’s just my professional opinion.”

Jillaroo Ready To Come Home After Finding Life Nothing Like McLeod’s Daughters

TEXT:

The trials and tribulations of Claire and Tess McLeod captured the hearts and minds of Australians for nearly a decade. Their realistic representation of life on the farm inspired an entire generation of men and women to drop the pens and pick up rake – however, as Hannah Ankerton (26) is just finding out, working on the land in real life is a little different to the way McLeod’s portrayed it.

Hannah is only in her first week of working on Pearson Downs, one of the larger cattle stations in QLD Channel Country, but she is already thinking about calling it quits.

“Where are all the hot neighbours? And the 2-hour breakfasts around the kitchen table?” Hannah complained to one of our reporters.

“I’m about to go camping for 4 nights while we try to muster the cattle, what the actual fuck?”

The Advocate understands a staggering 68% of potential Jillaroos and Jackaroos end up quitting within the first fortnight because the work isn’t what they imagined it would be.

Local entrepreneur and owner of Diamantina Air Freight And Charter, Nathan Campositos, is capitalizing on this high withdrawal rate, by offering GMTFO deals to desperate city-slickers who want to do exactly that, get the fuck out.

“Yeah so, I’ll usually do a couple trips up there a week, fly ‘em back down here.”

“They’re so desperate to leave they don’t even mind forking out the $350 for a short flight – I’m raking in enough to put my grandkids through private school!” Gary said almost disbelievingly.

With McLeod’s up on 9’s online streaming service, we anticipate there’ll be a lot more wannabe farmers with broken dreams to come.

Elton John Goes On Record And Says Saturday Night Is NOT OK For Fighting

TEXT:

Legendary British songbird Elton John interrupted a London concert this morning local time to preface the next song by saying times have changed and Saturday nights are no longer OK for fighting.

Saturday Night’s Alright for Fighting was the first single from John’s 1973 juggernaut Goodbye Yellow Brick Road and is among one of the most successful pieces of music in his vast catalogue of hits.

However, the song has attracted criticism from anti-violence groups in recent years for glorifying street violence and excessive alcohol consumption.

Which prompted Elton to speak out.

“I just want to say before I sing this song that I don’t condone violence against anyone or anything. Saturday Nights are not OK for fighting. No night is OK for fighting. Not now, not ever,”

“When Bernie [Taupin] and I put this track together, it was a different time. When masculinity was celebrated. Gosh, I barely remember the early 70s as it is,”

“Alright! Enough chit-chat, let’s play some music!”

John has been both lauded and criticised for his humility in this situation.

Anti-violence and anti-alcohol groups have told The Advocate that they were happy that they won the argument and that the anti-PC brigade lost.

“I used to hate Elton John and his music but now he shares my correct opinions, I love him,” said Peter Cornwallace of the Diamantina Anti-Fistfight Council.

“He’s been very mature with his discussion. He outlined that he was wrong and that people like me were right. That toxic masculinity is more toxic than the uranium fallout still blowing in the Woomerah wind,”

“I’m happy.”

But some in our society who enjoy getting blackout drunk and fighting strangers on the nature strip outside our town’s many pubs and clubs have lashed out at Elton for being ‘too PC’.

Alistair Bog-White, who works in an office environment day-to-day where he frustratingly has little to no power over his destiny – which he bottles up until it comes out at 11pm in the beer garden of a local pub, said John is just trying to appease the ‘snowflakes that take offence to anything.’

“I liked Elton when he was more like the Elton that told Lily Allen that he’d snort her under the table. He means cocaine. Doing more cocaine than Lily Allen in a party environment would be quite hard for the best of us, let alone an ageing rock god,” he said.

“But now he’s gone soft in his old age. Disappointing!”

Turnbull Attempts To Feel Disgusted At Banking Royal Commission’s Findings

TEXT:

The Prime Minister has laughed off the suggestion that he pretended to be horrified at the Royal Commission’s findings this afternoon, telling reporters he always thought the banking sector was all above board.

“I can assure you, when I was a banker, things were a lot different,” said Malcolm Turnbull this afternoon in Sydney.

“Honestly, these people are crooks. I can’t believe I put this off for so long. There will be prison sentences handed down as a result of this investigation,”

“Once again, I knew nothing of the sort of conduct the Commission has undercovered and any suggestion to the contrary will be met with legal action. Good day.”

Many journalists, even ones from News Corp publications, couldn’t help but laugh at the end of the press conference – with some saying they don’t know how he can say that after working in Emerging Markets at Goldman Sachs for so long.

But Turnbull is reportedly sticking to his guns, explaining that it’s mostly the everyday transaction banks that are the real focus of this investigation, not the larger investment banks in which the Prime Minister cut his teeth.

As a portly, swashbuckling Errol Flynn-type back in the 90s, Malcolm Turnbull bouned from merchant bank to merchant bank before finding himself sitting opposite Kerry Packer on Sydney’s fabled Park Street.

“Prior to working with the Packer Family, I was at Macquarie Bank. We invested in modern Australia, in infrastructure projects and public works. We aren’t the bad guys.”

One reporter from the SBS rolled his eyes before being dragged out of the press conference by his ponytail while the Prime Minister laughed.

Man Faces Oxygen Theft Charges After Being Accused Of Crime During Heated Facebook Argument

TEXT:

A popular local motocross enthusiast is tonight facing charges for a string of unsolved oxygen thefts in recent years after being accused of the crimes on social media.

Johnny Butler, third cousin to famous rock-folk troubadour John Butler, took to Facebook earlier this week to publically call out Mark Porter for failing to uphold his end of a ‘gentleman’s agreement’ regarding motorbike parts.

Earlier today, Mark was arrested by uniformed and plain-clothed detectives at his home in Betoota Ponds after a short struggle.

The developments have sent shockwaves through Betoota’s close-knit motocross community, which was still reeling after Triple J star, Thom Tilley, almost died in a motocross accident in the NSW  midwest.

However, with Johnny and Mark now embroiled in a bitter war of words over the allegations, the community is now divided.

“We believe Johnny,” said one local enthusiast, who asked to remain anonymous.

“Yeah! Mark has been stealing oxygen – and XR400 air filters for years now and nobody has had the guts to say anything!”

But the praise of Johnny wasn’t universal.

Some say that Mark should be afforded the opportunity to respond to the allegations, which he should be able to do in court.

“This type of social media witch hunt is not helping,” said Det. Colin Gregman of the South Betoota Police Command.

“As we’ve seen before. Anyone can throw allegations out via Facebook or Instagram or what have you but unfortunately, we live in a society with laws and the like,”

“This matter is now before the courts and we won’t be making any more statements until the conclusion of the trial. Thank you.”

First Home Buyers Posing With ‘Sold’ Sign Acting Like They Had No Help From Parents

TEXT:

A popular young professional couple has recently taken to social media to show friends, family and casual onlookers that they’ve recently entered the property market – heralding a new chapter in their lives.

Marcia Sock and Gavin Coolidge, both of Betoota Grove fame, are the new owners of a handsome four-bedroom home in a quiet cul-de-sac just steps from the homes they grew up in.

According to the pair, they’ve made many sacrifices to get where they are and that any young person can enter the housing market – provided they’re willing to work hard and go without.

“I’ve effectively given up skiing,” said Gavin, who graduated Deputy Head Prefect from the Whooton Academy – a large publically-funded private school in the heart of town.

“Marcia hasn’t taken stress leave for over a year. It’s been real ear-to-the-grindstone type slogging that’s gotten us to where we are,”

“Haters will say my Dad helped me, or Marcia’s Dad. The simple fact of the matter is that they didn’t just give us the money, we actually have to pay our parents back the 40% deposit. So fuck off.”

The selling agent initially told our reporter that the vendor wished to keep the sale price confidential, however, our reporter took him out on the town last night and got the figure out of him.

He said the 2ac property, complete with pool and man cave, sold for close to $2.1m.

The Advocate reached out to Gavin Coolidge Snr for comment on the matter and received a prompt reply.

“Of course I leant him money to buy a house. Almost half a million Australian pesos!” he said.

“I could afford it – and he only earns $70k a year so I had to co-sign the mortgage, too. Marcia’s father also chucked in a bit, not as much as me. He’s paying for the wedding and 6-month honeymoon so it’s only fair. We actually played golf a few months ago and the loser had to pay the first kid’s private school tuition,”

“I won but paid for the drinks afterwards!”

When pushed by our reporter, Gavin Snr conceded that it wouldn’t be possible to enter the property market without outside help.

“Well, if you want to live in a nice part of town or in a big city, you’ll need help as a young person. Little to no real wage growth, increased living expenses and an overinflated housing market? You don’t have a chance,”

“Any young person whose “bought” a nice house in a nice part of town had help from outside money and if they tell you otherwise, they’re full of shit.”

“No Case To Answer”: Legal Experts Prove Bachelor Contestants Actually Are ‘Vapid C*nts’

TEXT:

A retired local magistrate has weighed into the ‘vapid-cunt-gate’ sweeping controversy that’s making waves in the Australian media sphere – telling The Advocate that the journalist responsible for it and the news media organisation who published it have no case.

They have no case because the remarks were not defamatory because they were ‘true’.

Justice Wanda Redhorse, who served on the Queensland bar for over 30 years, enjoyed a strong cappuccino with our reporter this afternoon while she outlined her opinion on the ‘case’.

“There is no case to answer to,” said the popular Gemini.

“The Daily Mail is protected under Section 41A of the Copyright Act (1968) because they publish fake news and the reporter who published the article is protected from defamation and libel because, from a legal point of view, the contestants of that television show are ‘vapid cunts who are only interested in growing their social media presence,'”

“Any and all further ‘legal action’ by any contestant should be treated as a mere publicity stunt. The fact you and I are even talking about it now makes me weep for the future of this fine, albeit deeply troubled, country.”

The Advocate reached out to the show’s production company and Channel 10 for comment and have yet to receive a reply.

However, one former contestant on the show, who has been forced to return to real life, did reach out to our reporter today and confirmed that he is too a vapid cunt.

Asking to remain anonymous, the former reality TV show star explained just how vapid he is and how much he was able to capitalise on his newfound social media fame.

“I got sent a few free things, like men’s perfumes and t-shirts,” he said.

“But I wasn’t good enough to get a start on commercial radio. I got a job at a radio station but it was only to help pull the asbestos out of the roof in the Brisbane office when they did the rennos,”

“Be yeah, I am a real vapid cunt. I will do anything for money or fame. Can you guys give me a shoutout for doing this interview? Honestly, though. I can’t go back to the farm now. Dad’ll put me on the head bale all day without a break and make me mouth steers till the cows come home.”

Deconstructed Coffee A Surprise Hit In Local Primary School Staffroom

TEXT:

When the deconstructed coffee trend first started to appear in the French Quarter cafe scene, needless to say, a lot of locals were left unimpressed.

By the notion of paying for a service, only for that service to fall back to the consumer.

It was garnered a lot of local press; townsfolk wanted to know how and why this big-city-fad was finding traction here in our small desert community.

However, the trend has caught on and taken an Old City District primary school staffroom by storm.

“It’s so easy to get a coffee now,” said Ms Emma Hutchins, who’s enjoying her third-year teacher the K/1 composite at Remienko St Primary.

“I never thought I’d enjoy a deconstructed coffee – as I’m a no-nonsense country gal. But it’s so simple and the coffee isn’t that bad either,”

“All you have to do is take a few teaspoons of the instant coffee, put it in a half-clean mug then walk over to the sink and put some boiling water in it. As my old man would say, ‘Em, it’s a piece of piss!'”

The 28-year-old isn’t the only teacher rapt with the new way of making their morning brew.

As the school’s sole Kindergarten, Mr Mike Caldwell, he’s often on the coalface of workplace stress and pressure.

Though he initially blew up when the school decided that the staffroom’s Nespresso machine was an ‘unnecessary luxury’, he’s now quite taken with the generic-brand dehydrated coffee.

“My Pop always used to say that putting milk in coffee is a sign of weakness,” he said.

“I wasn’t in a position to despite that, he was a Rat of Tobruk and I guess he knew what was weak and what wasn’t. Regardless, I was a bit upset when they took away the nice coffee machine with the milk whipper thing,”

“But this is great, I can literally make a coffee in 15 seconds – and I know drink coffee without milk like a real-life cowboy. Nothing says cowboy like a long black! For once, I’m happy with the Department’s decision. Hopefully, they make these deconstructed coffees a part of Gonksi.”

Local Gent Organises Birthday Dinner At Local Hog’s Breath Like It’s 1999

TEXT:

After 18-months of fly-in fly-out work in the WA mining scene, Nathan Broadbridge (29) has shown his friends just how much the lifestyle hasn’t changed him by organising his birthday dinner at their local Hog’s Breath.

While there are multiple venues he could have selected, such as gastro pubs, restaurants and even RSL function rooms, Broadbridge has chosen to celebrate his 30th birthday at the South Betoota Hog’s Breath with a table of people who weren’t aware the popular steakhouses were still a thing. 

“We had to cancel the strippergram. It would just seem wrong for her to show up while a family of six is trying to enjoy a Rocky Road Sundae,” explained one friend.

“What year is it? The last time I went to a Hog’s Breath was the same day the Olympic Torch relay passed through Betoota!”

Famous for their fusion of no-frills dining and comically steep prices, Hog’s Breath is most known for being the venue the group dinner takes place at when the first choice of venue was unavailable and for somehow cooking a steak over 18 hours.

Traditionally the choice of special dinner whenever the middle child wins an award at school, Broadbridge’s friends were naturally surprised that the usually loose unit picked the Australian themed dinner as the venue for his 30th.

“Has he forgotten what celebrations are meant to be like? Has he eaten that many in-flight meals that a Tex-Mex steak sounds like the sort of thing you eat on a special occasion?”

In a previous statement made on the Facebook event “Big Nat’s B’Day @ Hoggies,” Broadbridge stated he chose Hogsbreath as he’s looking “Just to have an easy one at Hoggies,” and hopes it’s clear everyone will be paying for their own food.

“I might be on jet ski money but I’m not about to shout twenty blokes to some good ol’ fashioned Hogspitality. That’s such a ‘pissa’ word just quietly. Nah, just wanted a quiet one this year. Take it easy, have a surf and turf and a few Strongbow tins,”

For the time being Broadbridge’s mates are hopeful his FIFO work will bring him closer to home and keep him in touch with his mates and his overall sense of reality.

“I’m hoping Adani opens so he doesn’t have to be as far from home and we can keep an eye on him. That will be the best result for everyone.”

Type-1 Diabetic Urges People Not To Lump His Superior Kind In With The Unwashed Type-2s

TEXT:

A popular local tradesman with a largely inconvenient auto-immune condition has made it clear to some new friends last night that he was born with Type-1 diabetes – and that he feels a mild superiority over those with the Type-2 variety.

Darcy Carmichael, of Longview Road in Betoota Heights, was observed last night in the Dolphins Club bistro telling a couple friends-of-friends that he has Type-1 and not the self-inflicted Type-2 variety.

Moments after he finished dinner, which was the penne carbonara special washed down with two schooners of full-strength Coca-Cola, he pulled his insulin pen from his back pocket and dialled it up to 26.

“Don’t mind me fellas,” he said, pinching some skin beside his belly button.

“Just got to fuel myself up for the evening. Yeah, it’s a bit of a bitch but what can you do?”

When asked by Oliver Radley, who was sat opposite Darcy in the bistro, if he was a Type-2, the mood in Betoota’s best value dining area suddenly changes.

“I’m not one of those bloody Type-2 people, I was born with a dodgy pancreas. If my pancreas was a whipper-snipper, it’d be for sale in The Advocate for $10 and it’d blow more blue smoke than Grandma’s Ford Escort. It’d be fucked mate,”

“I actually take pretty good care of myself – unlike them Type-2 folk. I’d like to make it clear, boys and girls, that I can’t help it and I can’t get cured, so fuck yas.”

Darcy nodded and paused for a moment then ran a finger through the sauce left on his plate.

“Anyway, who wants a game of air hockey?”

More to c0me.

Family Lunch Pauses To Hear Single, Childless Freak Try And Justify Lifestyle

TEXT:

Peeling himself off his bedsheets this morning in his un-airconditioned sharehouse bedroom, a largely unpopular 28-year-old sighed as he remembers the family lunch pencilled in for today.

Stacey Porter, who says he vaguely recalls going out last night but can’t be certain where, did he best to wash the previous night’s filth off his rapidly softening corpse-like body before he sniffed a few dress shirts that he picked up off his bedroom floor to tell which one he’d be wearing to lunch.

During the awkwardly-long 34 minute drive up the hill from the French Quarter to his parent’s homely, leafy five bedder in Betoota Grove, the account executive rehearsed responses to the inevitable questions about his lifestyle.

“Mum! I’m happy with where my life is heading, just leave me alone,” he said to himself.

Too dismissive and mean-spirited, he thought. His father might interject if he overheard that, making things worse.

“I’m just trying to work my life out, Mum. Please don’t worry about me. I’m having the time of my young life,” he again said to himself.

Better.

He conceded that though his parents don’t know about his penchant for buying “drugs” from strangers in dark, sweaty nightclubs, he thought they at least deserved an answer as to why he does the things he does.

He spoke to our reporter briefly on the street before he went around the side of the house and joined the party.

“My younger brother is getting married, he’s two years younger than me. I told Mum and Dad that he’s a moron and it’ll be over before the Tokyo Olympics and they scolded me for it,”

“And then my two older sisters have kids now. One of them is allergic to peanuts, I think. What a time to be alive. And they ask me why I live like I do. Anyway, I’ll let you know how it goes.”

Two hours later, Stacey rang the offices of The Advocate to share the news.

“It was OK, copped the usual questions. I told them I enjoyed the freedom of doing what I want when I want. Both of my brother in laws agreed with me, which was refreshing but that caused a whole other episode of drama. Except for my young brother, he said I had rocks in my head,”

“He’s a Christian and he’s getting married at 24. Pull the other one, mate.”

Former Ringers In The Big Smoke Start Swapping Yarns From Up North

TEXT:

“What was it like working for Kidman? I’ve heard their staff turnover and retention rates are pretty bad,” asked Oscar Pooley, who says he works in agribusiness.

“It wasn’t that bad. The Channel Country stations had that problem because they’re so isolated from everywhere. You’d go mad working down in the channels out past Thargo, you would,” replied Miles Winslow, who also claims to work in agribusiness.

The pair, who turned their back on the desert way of life some time ago, have found themselves in the more cosmopolitan South-East in recent times – but they both agree it was a necessary evil.

As the divide between regional and urban Australia grows wider, they both realised that their dreams of making it big in this world couldn’t come true on a Western Queensland verandah; they had to push their boats out of the safe harbour of Betoota Heights and brave the sea of life – all the way down to Brisbane.

Before last night, they didn’t know each other – but they had mutual friends they knew from their time up north.

So they bonded over the only thing they could.

“We ran an absolute fuck this one day on the Cooper,” said Miles.

“Cattle going everywhere. Choppers clipping the top of gidgee trees. Blokes yelling into the radio every ten minutes for help.”

Oscar laughed knowingly and took a sip.

“All we had to do was push the bastards into a corner and get them going down the lane back to the yards. We tried putting a block on them but you would’ve needed a bloody light horse cavalry charge to put a bend in those bastards that day,” said Miles.

“We had the manager in the Cessna basically backfiring the 172 ontop them and nothing. One chopper pilot put a few rubbers into this ‘uge mickey bull on the lead and that only made things worse,”

“We got them in the end but fuck me roan, it was an absolute fuck, mate. You’d seldom see a bigger circus.”

Not wanting to ‘one-up’ the yarn but simply compliment it, Oscar took another sip before launching into a yarn from the Kimberly, where was for two seasons as a young man.

He thought long and carefully about which one he was going to tell before settling on an old favourite.

“So there was this one time out the back of the Ord near where the salt flats start,” said Oscar.

Despite not knowing where that was, Miles nodded and smiled as if to say ‘go on, what we are doing is great fun.’

“This big old bull, he had a 08 brand on him. A veritable pensioner, you’d say. Anyway, boorie, he kept leading the mob back into the push and wouldn’t take a bend. A real heady prick he was. So I’ve hooned up beside him on the XR650 and basically tried to put a bend in him with my size 11 Baxter and the bike itself. Long story short, mate, he’s not taken too kindly to me putting the boot into his right ear,”

Miles started peeling the label off his beer bottle in nervous excitement.

“So he’s come at me and thrown me off the bike and off into this big tree. So I’m picking myself up and the bull just comes at me, forces me up into this tree. I’m up in this Emu Apple tree watching this bull stomp on my bike and basically break the thing. I’ve called for a chopper to come help me out and he’s come over from the main mob and basically laughed at me,”

“It was a long day but we got them in the end, mate. It was a bit of a fuck, but yeah. Good times. Wish I could go back.”

The pair then paused to reflect for a moment before Oscar asked Miles if he wanted another beer.

Motorist Flashes High Beams To Inform Others Of Fucking Copper Dogs Around The Bend

TEXT:

It had just past 8:00pm as Jarrod Moreton flew around the bend on the Diamantina Hill road, not in a particular hurry, he just liked to go fast. 

Unbeknownst to Jarrod, there was a police officer hiding just 2km ahead – waiting to nab an innocent lead foot like himself.

Just as Jarrod was getting into the chorus of INXS’ ‘Burn For You’, another motorist driving the opposite direction flicked their high beam lights 3-5 times in quick succession – which, Jarrod knew, could only mean one thing, copper dogs.

Jarrod slowed his ‘99 Holden Commodore to the legal speed limit just before he came into range of the policeman’s radar gun, successfully, albeit narrowly, escaping the iron fist of the law once again thanks to the universal hatred of police.

Speaking to one of our reporters on the phone shortly after the incident, Jarrod explained the significance of this gesture, which as it turns out, goes much further than this isolated exchange.

“Think of it kind of like a relay, but it’s never ending. Say someone flicks their lights at you, you now have to flick your lights at someone else before you can clear your conscience”

“Because instinctively as Australians we naturally hate any form of authority, none more than highway cops”

“Oh shit, here comes someone now!” We hear background flicking sounds as Jarrod warns an oncoming car.

“My debt is now paid” he said. 

The Advocate understands that this particular chain mail like light-flicking has been in continuation since the early 80s, when local piano retailer Bob Bristol drove home intoxicated and was warned by an unknown hero that the police were up ahead. Needless to say, bob wasn’t caught by the police but a sense of owing gratitude followed Bob round for the rest of his life.

Half-Genuine Discussion Of Getting Bags Two Hours Ago Now Quite A Serious One

TEXT:

Two happy-go-lucky local finance workers told themselves this afternoon that this weekend would be a quiet one.

Dreams of lying beside the Betoota Heights Olympic Pool, pretending to read the latest Tim Winton, perhaps even a macadamia Weiss bar when the heat of the afternoon really kicked in.

Timmy Doolan and Alec Dalton both entertained that fantasy, albeit briefly, before relinquishing their souls to the night.

The dynamic duo ran into one of our reporters

“We were about four or five pints down when Alec laughed and said we should get a bag,” said Timmy.

“But as we both thought about having a quiet one, we both laughed it off as something we would’ve done last year. Something juvenile and idiotic. We don’t need any cheap headphones tonight,”

“Anyway, mate. Cheers, love the paper. You do this country a service. Blah, blah, blah. I’m not going to piss in your pocket anymore, mate. I’ll talk to you later.”

And talk to our reporter later he did.

Moments ago, a now heavily intoxicated Alec bumped it way out of the dancefloor with half a tankard of rum down his front.

The perennially underachieving private wealth manager at Bell Potter’s small but efficient South Betoota office had one thing on his mind and one thing only.

“Hey bruz, do you have a bag number?” he coughed at our reporter.

Our reporter indicated that he did not – or at least have one he was willing to hand out like an estate agent’s business card.

Satisfied, Alec stumbled back over to Timmy, who was attempting to put a bet on.

“We need to get a number, bro,” said Alec.

“Timmy, bro. Are we getting on? If we’re not, I’m going home, bro.”

Timmy shrugged and told Alec was leaving.

Young Professional Passed Out On Train About To Wake Up In Suburb He’s Only Heard Bad Things About

TEXT:

Some of his firm’s biggest clients are in town this week, which means John Cunningham needs to be on his A-game.

One part of that game includes the great Australian male pass time – binge drinking.

Last night at a popular French Quarter nightspot, John and a choice group of senior partners, junior partners and other executives devoid of a greater defining feature, entertained their big white whales with drinks, fine food and great conversation.

All of which to a toll on the young private wealth manager, who bid his party farewell last night at around 1 AM – leaving him just enough time to briskly walk down the hill to the Rue de Jardin Metro Station and board the last Green Line service to Betoota Heights.

It was only four stops but it seems the sensibly-priced malbec sloshing around in his tum-tum proved to be too powerful.

Shortly after the Metro left Rue de Jardin, the 28-year-old was dead to the world.

Close to an hour passed before a train guard violently shook the piss-wrecked Gemini back to life.

“W…w…where am I, bro?” uttered John, the bitter tannins stuck to the roof of his mouth took him by surprise.

“You’re out at the Ponds, mate. You’ve gotta get off. Metro service terminates here,” replied the train guard.

“Next one back into town leaves in a couple hours.”

It occurred to John, albeit slowly, that he was a long way away from home in a suburb that the local media has painted in a negative light as of late.

He spoke to The Advocate this afternoon through a hangover haze, he says, that would kill the toughest kelpie in Coonamble.

“It hit me like a tonne of bricks,” he said.

“They wouldn’t even let me wait in the station, they kicked me out onto the street at 2:34 AM in Betoota Ponds. First thing I did was put my phone down the side of a boot and the wallet down the other. There I was, standing in the carpark of the station, watching these kids ride around on their pushbikes,”

“Some folk were crowded around a 44-gallon drum fire. I honestly thought I’d be mugged. I didn’t exactly look like I belonged there,”

“So I tried to play it cool. I lit a smoke and sat down on the steps of the station and waited. Then the bike gang came over and basically told me that I was going to give them all a cigarette. So I did. Just as the train was about to leave back into the city, they asked for the whole packet. I didn’t want a steak knife thrust into my liver so I just gave it up,”

“It wasn’t as bad as people say it is, out at the Ponds. Wouldn’t live there, but.”

Office Man Playing ‘Clash Of Clans’ On His Phone Demands To Be Taken Seriously

TEXT:

A fully grown human male has made a concerted plea to his work colleagues today, to overlook one of his vices.

The 36-year-old Chief of Staff at Betoota Municipal Council was forced to request that the people around him in the workplace respect him as fully functioning member of society despite the fact that he plays games on his mobile phone at his desk.

The happily married Ben Thienpont has risen up the ranks in the office at the council over the last few years because of his lack of interpersonal skills and social awareness, ensuring that he is able to order people around and commit himself to the job without any care for his relationships with those around him.

And, because of those personality traits, Thienpont likes to find solace in the mobile game popular amongst insular teenagers and fedora wearing IT graduates, called Clash Of Clans.

Thienpont told one of our reporters that he doesn’t like the game to get in the way of his daily roles and tasks, but simply likes to enjoy it as a little break when he gets some downtime.

“That’s the beauty of the game. You don’t need to set aside chunks of time to play it. You just pop in here and there to check your village is on track and makes sure your army is adequately resourced,” he said.

“It makes me feel like a real strategist. But it’s just a shame that people have noticed me playing the game and now don’t take me seriously.”

Some of the other staff at the council chambers have told The Advocate that Thienpont is the butt of jokes around the open plan office, and his requests to be taken seriously have fallen on deaf ears.

Rachel Beechworth, a fellow employee explained that Thienpont’s habit has caused irreparable damage to his social standing within the office.

“Yeah, he was never really looked upon as an everyman, but the fact that he is constantly seen diving into this mythical world while he chomps on his ham and cheese sandwiches has meant that the rest of us won’t be taking him very seriously for quite some time.”

Parents Of New P-Plater Excited To No Longer Drink-Drive Home From The Club Each Night

TEXT:

Peter and Nancy Pearson have waited years for the day, and yesterday it finally came.

Their eldest son Graeme got his provisional license – meaning it was time for the sexagenarians to get a little bit of payback for all the years they drove him around.

Mere minutes after they got the news, the Baby Boomers changed into their Sunday best and made the comfortable 30-minute stroll from their Betoota Grove four-bedder down the hill to the French Quarter Jazz Club.

It’s a popular haunt for the property-owning class of Betoota.

Some nights The Advocate‘s editor and popular bourgeois pig, Clancy Overell, plays the clarinet down there.

But last night, Peter and Nancy got more hammered than the night they conceived their youngest child on the living room rug in front of the Beijing Olympics opening ceremony.

Our reporter caught up with 17-year-old Graham this afternoon, where over a cold tin, he recounted the horror of what greeted him at the Jazz Club last night.

“Dad rang and asked to be picked up,” he said.

“He was so hammered, I didn’t even recognise his voice. So anyway, I got in the Falcon and potted on down to the club. I swung around into Jones Avenue and saw Mum face down on the lawn in front of the Jazz Club and Dad was relieving himself on a tree – both of which were equally traumatic for me,”

“So with the help of Dad, we threw Mum across the back seat. She immediately projectile vomited right into the seat and down the side of the door. It stunk of house white, Kalua and chewed oysters. Dad was more lucid but only just. He shouted about the government and made me stop at McDonald. Then he passed out in the passenger seat. I left them both in the car when I got home but put Mum on her side so she wouldn’t Bon Scott herself. Good to have my P’s, but.”

The Advocate reached out to Peter and Nancy for comment but only received a short, one sentence response.

“We are excited as we no longer have to drive home blackout drunk from the club anymore.”

Addition Of Chair To New Post Break-Up Bedroom Clear Evidence Man’s Life Is Getting Back On Track

TEXT:

Two months ago, Nathan Dollarhyde’s life was perfect according to the man himself.

Today, it’s far from it.

The Advocate can reveal this afternoon that his partner of six years, Amanda O’Donghue, felt there was a lot more life could offer her beyond the Betoota City Limits – so she left.

“And that was that,” concedes the 28-year-old office person.

“About a month ago, I came home and all her stuff was packed up in boxes by the door. She was sitting on the couch waiting for me, blah, blah, blah you don’t need to hear all of this. Long story short, I handed the keys back to the agent about a week ago and I’ve moved back into a share house with a bunch of randoms,”

“Not ideal – but you’ve got to do what you’ve got to do in this life. I guess that’s why Mandy left, right? Anyway, I’m still sleeping on a blow-up mattress, I’ve ordered a new mattress from Koala so I’m looking forward to not waking up feeling like I’ve been run over by a bus. I got a chair the other day. Things are slowly returning to normal.”

And what a chair it is, according to a formerly-concerned friend, Hannah Willmott.

Hannah told our reporter that she was ‘a bit worried’ about Nathan for a while – especially after seeing just how far he was willing to let his personal hygiene and self-esteem nosedive  in the weeks immediately after Amanda’s departure – but the addition of a cool new chair to his otherwise extremely depressing new Betoota Heights bedroom has put her mind at ease.

“He got it from the shire council clean-up,” she said.

“Now he doesn’t have to sit on the floor to put his shoes on in the morning. I’ve also seen him hang shirts on the chair. I think he’s finally getting his life back on track now, which is great because he deserves to be happy,”

“I think he might need some more things, like a bed frame and maybe a closet or clothes rack. If he really wanted to spice things up, he might even get a bedside table. But for now, these baby steps are fine.”

Mike Baird Curses Himself After Trying To Get A Bottle Of Red After Midnight Mass

The former Premier of New South Wales looked up in the sky last night and asked God why he does the things he does.

Caught short at his local, the Lake Street Liquor Supply in Sydney’s north, Mike Baird cursed himself for being the architect behind the Puritan laws that saw bottle shops close statewide at 10pm.

He was on his way home from a special midnight mass when he felt a bit of a thirst coming on – a thirst for the blood of Christ.

A neighbour, who lives across the street from the bottle shop spoke briefly to The Advocate this morning and described in detail what happened next.

“Mike got out of his Uber, walked up to the security roller door and knocked on it,” he said.

“When he realised that it was well past midnight and the bottle shop was indeed shut, he let out one of the loudest F-bombs I’ve ever heard. After he was done, almost every dog in the neighbourhood was barking and I think there was a car alarm going off,”

“Then he went after himself, saying things like, ‘You fucking idiot! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!’ – it was pretty full on. Then he threw himself on the ground and writhed around. He smashed his head against the footpath a few times. Catholic guilt is one hell of a drug. Anyway, he got up and brushed himself off then got back in the Uber.”

The Advocate reached out to Mr Baird and the National Australia Bank for comment but have yet to receive a reply.

Former Premier Barry O’Farrell, who ironically was brought unstuck by a bottle of Wolseley Road sangria, was also contacted for comment and replied only with a single emoji.

” ¯\_(ツ)_/¯,” Barry emojied.

Varsity Jacket-Wearing Third-Year Under The Impression He’s At A US College

TEXT:

Aaron Webster has confirmed today that he is actually aware that he is currently attending a regional Australian university.

The 3rd year commerce student at South Betoota Polytechnic College was approached by our reporters after other students alleged that the young man may have been of the belief that he was at a tertiary education system in the United States of America.

“Yeah, I go to the Polytechnic mate,” he told our reporters.

When prodded on why he was wearing an expensive Betoota Polytechnic Varsity jacket, Webster explained that he just reckons “they look dope.”

“Varsity jackets are sweet. I like wearing them because they make me feel like a bit of a boss you know?” said the student who cites the TV Show ‘Friday Night Lights’ as a major influence upon his personality.

Elyse Costa, a fellow classmate of Webster, spoke to us earlier and said that she is of the opinion that American style ‘jock jackets’ are about as lame as items of clothing come.

“Personally, I think they reek of wannabe jock. Not actual jock, like ‘was a bit of a loser at school, but I’m reinventing myself at uni’ wannabe kind of jock,” Costa said.

After our conversation with Costa, we levelled the allegations at Webster, and he refuted them with:

“Whatever, I don’t need to justify what I wear, that’s why I came to uni man. She sounds like a loser nerd anyway.”

Man’s Contempt For Job Shines Through In New Corporate Headshots

When Matthew Greenholm was 12 years old, he told his parents he wanted to be a pilot.

But as Powderfinger so eloquently sang on arguably their greatest single: “These days turned out nothing like I’d planned.”

The Gemini is now a 29-year-old leasing agent at LJ Hooker South Betoota, who despite his outward assurances, doesn’t seem to like his job.

“I think that’s fairly evident in my new headshot,” he said.

“One huge downside about real estate is that you need to have your face on everything. Everything from the internet to the bits of junk mail you find plastered to your garage floor after a rainstorm. Anyway,”

“You can tell by the look in my eyes that I hate real estate. I hate people who own real estate and I hate people interested in real estate. You are all cunts. Even the ones who vote Green.”

Matthew’s boss, Colin Hooker, laughed to himself loudly in his hard-earned corner cubical while our reporter asked him for comment on his young leasing agents new headshot.

He agreed that he looked about as enthused for real estate as a 27-year-old bar manager with a cocaine addiction does.

“Yeah, he hates his fucking job. It’s written all over his face,” said Colin.

“But everyone hates their job. People who say they love their jobs are liars – and there’s no room for liars in the real estate game. Those headshots, though, Christ on a fucking pushbike,”

“He’s already got four new leads off the back of them so I guess the general mood in the aspirational suburbs of Betoota Heights is one of lethargic apathy and general hopelessness – which is great for the rental market.”

Sleepy-Eyed Apartment-Dweller Tries To Work Out Which Neighbour Burnt The Toast

TEXT:

There will be a time and place when the smoke alarm system at the Dupont Apartment complex in Betoota Heights will save lives.

It worked flawlessly last night as it woke 67-year-old Gavin Pooley from his slumber around 3 AM.

But even if it didn’t, it wouldn’t have cost him his life.

For the third time this year, one of his neighbours has come home from the nearby nightlife district with a gutful of piss and burnt something to the point were four fire trucks are summoned and everybody has to stand out in the cold for half an hour.

To pass the time, Gavin likes to find a nice place to sit and try to work out which one of his spoon-headed neighbours is guilty of burning the toast.

“I think it was that bloke over there,” he said, pointing at a husky student.

“He’s always fart-arsing about in the early hours. He and his flatmates yahoo and carry on every weekend. But Mondays, I’m not so sure. I’ve caught him crying in the laundry a few times on a Monday, which makes me think he’s a heavy MDMA user,”

“Or it could be the young parents over there. They’ve set it off before and tried to own the situation but after they understood there’s no bright side to standing out in the frost at 4AM, they quickly changed their tune. To be honest, I think it’s them again. They look guilty.”

The sexagenarian admits it’s the only thing that helps him pass the time when the fire alarm goes off.

But he also concedes that he’d rather be woken up every now and then rather than burn to death in his bed,

WrestleMania XXXIV: Management Forced To Write Day Off As The Undertaker Returns

TEXT:

Productivity at a French Quarter sports marketing firm has ground to a halt this afternoon as The Undertaker made his return to the highest altar of explosive sports entertainment.

So much so, the company partners declared an emergency meeting after lunch to discuss what to do as their entire staff sat transfixed before the lunchroom television.

“We’re going to have to write the rest of the day off,” said Greg Altwood, a founding partner of Fist Piston Sports.

“Nobody is responding to emails. Meetings for the afternoon have either been pushed back or rescheduled. Somebody has ordered Pizza Hut – which has subsequentially been scoffed by the sales blokes – so there no use to anybody this afternoon,”

“I don’t see any way past this other than just let them watch it or if they don’t like wrestling, get them to clear their desk and call the union rep because they’re fired.”

Margot Davis, an account coordinator at Fist Piston, said that while she doesn’t particularly watch wrestling week-to-week, when Wrestlemania rolls around, she always makes time.

The 24-year-old compared it to the Melbourne Cup and the AFL Grand Final.

“There’s a bit of a carnival atmosphere here right now. Everybody loves The Undertaker. He’s like the UnderDog, if you get me,” she said.

“I don’t even know what’s going on but the sheer spectacle of the thing is incredible. It’s just so entertaining,”

“The only thing that’d make it better would be a surprise appearance from Conor McGregor. Imagine Conor suplexing Dana White through a table? How mad would that be?”

Freshly Untucked, Crinkled Shirt A Key Indication Man Didn’t Shake Enough

TEXT:

In a world where image is everything, a quick-thinking entomology professor at South Betoota Polytechnic College has saved the day after he partially wet himself shortly before lunch today by untucking one side of his shirt.

Having classes on Sunday isn’t a new concept for Associate Professor Gilbert Sutherland – but failing to shake moments before a class was due to start is.

“I didn’t know what to do,” he said.

“I thought about standing beside the hand dryer but if somebody walked it, I’d probably lose my job if they saw my crotch up against the vent. So I was in a jam,”

“But I had an idea. I tucked one side of my shirt – and it worked. You couldn’t tell I’d failed to shake all the piss out of myself like the moron I am.”

Prof. Sutherland said it was a necessity to fix the problem as his students sit eye-level to his belt – making the probability of them seeing what he’d just done to his trousers an almost certain possibility.

But one of his Sunday students wasn’t fooled.

Sam Pontsford, a perennial local fuck-up with an academic record that looks worse than his face did in Year 10, thought Sutherland would’ve been better off trying his hands on the front of his trousers – as to make the wee mark blend in with the handprints.

“Just a thought,” he told our reporter shortly after class – as he smoked well within 5 meters of the auditorium entrance.

“It was pretty obvious but I appreciate the effort but in all honesty, he should’ve at least untucked the other half of his shirt.”

Report: Each Group Of Mates Has At Least One Bloke Who Thinks He Can Throw Hands

TEXT:

“Seriously but, there is no way I’d step into the ring with Morny, he’d take my head off,” laughed one friend. 

A conversation at the North Betoota Hotel on Friday night has reconfirmed a group of friend’s reluctance to fight one of their mates – if it ever came to it.

It was quickly established by the group that Dom Mornal, who was the 2009 U19 ‘Golden Gloves’ champion of Western Queensland, wouldn’t be receiving title challenges anytime soon.

One friend was overheard recounting; “Do you remember that time when Morny decked that gatecrasher at Sandy’s 21st? I know the bloke started it but Dom sure as shit finished it.”

Whilst Mornal physical dominance had been made obvious, it was unclear as to whether he was even aware of it, as one friend was heard laughing, “you’d never bloody tell the bloke though would ya.”

The Advocate reached out to Dom for comment on the allegations and he was more than happy to entertain our reporter via telephone for around an hour.

While he accepts the fact that he ‘gets in a lot of fights’, he’s reluctant to wear the title of Chief Protector Among Mates [CPAM] but concedes it’s a bed he’s made that he’s now forced to sleep in.

“I know how to throw hands,” he said.

“I got into boxing at an early age, where they tell you to never fight out of a ring and I all my life, I’ve tried to live by that code,”

“But sometimes, that’s not possible. Especially when people find out you can throw hands. You become a magnet for trouble, folk try to take a shot at the title. It’s just life.”

Each Horrifying Step Retraced From Last Night As Local Teacher Looks Through Transaction History

TEXT:

“What is ‘Dazos Brothers Sth Betoota Pty Ltd’ and what did I buy there for $10.40?”

Smelling her the cuffs of her Zimmerman jacket, Ollie Hawker concluded that it was probably something with garlic.

This morning, the skittish Gemini woke to a dull headache, mild thirst and an awkward lethargy that will dictate the rest of her Saturday.

But one of the first things she did this morning, after going through the activity logs of her various social media accounts to see who and what she liked in the wee hours of Friday night, was check her transaction history to witness the financial carnage that was last night.

“I think I got off pretty lightly,” she told our reporter.

“Looks like I only spent about $90 all up. But god, I don’t remember that $40 transaction at the Dolphins Club – but I know exactly what that was now – a bottle of that Cairns mango wine,”

“Is it bad I know that? It’s so tasty, but. Anyway, it all looks in order. No cash withdrawals – which is nice. Didn’t buy any cheap headphones it seems. But doing this, albeit tough, helps me retrace my steps last night. Especially when there are blank spots.”

The 26-year-old then told our reporter she was going back to sleep.

First Bloke At Pub Has Had Way More Solo Phone Beers Than He’s Letting On

TEXT:

Throughout the day, Danny Madigan was led to believe he and the rest of his WhatsApp group would be getting on the beers from about 4 pm today.

So at 4 pm today, the 28-year-old arrived at the Dolphins Leagues Club to find he was the first piece of shit there.

“So I shrugged and got myself a big cold Betoota Bitter; found a quiet nook and whipped the phone out,” he said.

Fifteen minutes passed and still – he was alone – and his first beer was now making its way through his soft, unathletic body.

“And again,” he smiled and nodded toward the barman.

Half an hour passed before Danny felt relaxed and happy enough to fire a message off to the group. He wanted to know if everyone was running on Fiji time this afternoon.

“Just on my way now, mate,” wrote one friend.

“Tommy and I are waiting for a cab uptown. Be like 10 I reckon.”

Another 20 minutes passed and Danny had galloped his way through two more pints and a packet of Red Rock something – honey soy chicken he thinks.

Finally, after four and a half pints of heavy lager, the first gaggle of weak-chinned office people Danny calls friends walked through the door.

They all exchanged their pleasantries – it’d been just under a week since they’d been together like this.

But Danny, unbeknown to the rest of the party, was already pretty lit.

He spoke briefly to our reporter in the smoking area before returning back inside to his friends.

“Man,” he said.

“I’m not going to make it out after this. Either I slow down or I tell them to catch up. I think I might go have a timeout and feed a pineapple through a brickies laptop or something?”

Cashed Up Local Bloke Treats His 1994 Nissan Pulsar To A Tank Of 98 Octane

TEXT:

A local fourth-year bakers apprentice has this week wound up with a bit of extra cash than usual, after pulling off a cheeky Keno win during an Easter family gathering at Betoota Dolphins Leagues Club.

Dale Berrigan, 20, said he was just “feeling generous” when he reached for the 98% octane nozzle at the local Puma, in what he puts down to a random act of kindness.

“She’s been good to me” Dale said, rubbing the side mirror of his 1994 Nissan Pulsar. “She’s taken me and me mates all ‘round the place. I tell ya what, she’d have some stories to tell hahaha nah but seriously she deserves it, and I wanna see her kick on for a few more years yet. Plus, you know, probably get a few extra K’s out of her too”.

Back at home, Dale was surprised and a little upset to learn that his girlfriend, Deena, wasn’t as impressed with his charming deed as he’d initially believed she would be.

“Aaargh that’s such a fucking Dale thing to do” She told The Betoota Advocate.

“He’s always playing the ‘poor apprentice’ thing. I buy all the ciggies, all the food and says he’ll pay me back. Then he goes and buys the fancy fuel for his shitty car? Do you know how much that shit costs? Fuck my life, seriously.”

“She just doesn’t understand I guess” Dale said in response. “I’m doing her a favour. I’m gonna end up saving money anyway cos of the fuel economy and shit. It lasts way longer”.

Local Jogger Is Only Able To Jog Down Busy Footpaths At Peak Hour

TEXT:

Though Betoota Heights is essentially a quiet grid pattern with two main streets, local fitness fanatic, Peter Douglas, says he’s only able to do his morning and afternoon jogs down the busiest streets when foot traffic is at its heaviest.

“It’s a real inconvenience,” said the 34-year-old.

“I’m trying to do my cardio and there’s just a sea of slow walking soft bodies getting in the way of me. Honestly, don’t get me started. I wish there was another way for me to get my heart rate up but yeah, running up and down Collins and Mayne Road is the only way,”

“And I can only do it between 5 and 6 in the arvo and just after 7 in the morning. I’ve been lobbying to the Shire Council to put running lanes in for us fast movers – but the mayor just told us to run down a quieter street. Who’ll see me exercise there?”

The Advocate reached out to Mayor Keith Carton, who also represents Betoota Heights as a Councillor, for comment on the matter.

But his version of events doesn’t align with that of Mr Douglas.

“He accosted me down at the Sailing Club last week and demanded that I consider people like him and their right to exercise wherever he wants – including Collins St of an afternoon,”

“I told him that everyone else has a right to be there just as much as he did, to which he exploded. I said there’s acres of parkland, quiet quaint streets and even a number of 24-hour gyms he could use – but he insisted he’s only able to run up and down busy roads,”

“It was 5:30 pm last Thursday so I really was not in the mood so I had him removed from the club and had the bouncers throw his New Balances in the lake. Next time, I’ll have his legs broken.”

Oyster Card Still Featured Prominently In Local Bloke’s Wallet Despite London Dream Dying Months Ago

TEXT:

Sacha Boromir arrived home to South Betoota just before Christmas but he’s not ready to let go of London, according to his wallet.

There are times when, upon boarding the KonnektSouth Bus line that goes past his parent’s three bedder on Green Road, he accidentally pulls his Oyster card – London’s equivalent of Betoota’s BaiameCard – from his wallet and holds it to the touch plate.

“Whoops,” he’d say.

“I’ve just returned from two years in London! Force of habit, I guess! Let me just get my BaiameCard out, hope it’s still got some money on it!”

But Sacha knows and the people who see him with his Oyster card in hand know, that the 28-year-old’s London dream died long, long ago.

He spoke to our reporter at a popular French Quarter cafe this afternoon.

“I guess I’m not ready to let go,” he said.

“Other there, I was somebody. Here, I’m just another piece of shit floating in the toilet bowl of life. I was Sasha, from Australia. That defined me. My friends back home thought, ‘Gosh. Old Sach is really kicking goals. He lives in London now, he’s having the time of his fucking life,’

“Nowadays, I’m sleeping in my childhood bedroom and going to one job interview a week. Life is hard.”

When asked if he’d consider taking the Oyster card out of his wallet and perhaps keeping it safe somewhere, Sacha said he’d consider it – just not yet.

PM: “My Boomer-Friendly May Budget Will Trickle Down To Millennials. Trust Me.”

TEXT:

Short of having people over 64 put to sleep and their entire wealth redistributed back into the economy, Malcolm Turnbull has hinted that his ‘make-or-break’ May budget will benefit all Australians – including entitled middle-class Millennials.

Speaking today from the Royal Motor Yacht Club in the quickly gentrifying East Point Piper district of the otherwise exclusive Sydney peninsula, the Prime Minister took a leaf out of Peter Costello’s book and told reporters that this next budget will be fair and lean.

“Our aim is to create jobs and get the nation back in the black. All the savings this budget will pass on to big business and the more senior members of society will trickle down to the youth. Trust me, I know what I’m doing,” he said.

“This time around, I’ve had more to do with the budget. As you all know, I was the managing director of Goldman Sachs Australia and I invented the internet. In my prime, I could’ve had someone put in the foundations of ANZ Stadium with just a text message,”

“But that is beside the point. This budget will appease all Australians and if your opinion is different, then your opinion is incorrect. Just let me do this, the right-faction is still hungover from Easter – this is my time to shine.”

However, according to the mildly popular kayaker, there are many people who have the wrong opinion about his new budget.

One outspoken young man, who identifies as a millennial, took the time out of his busy afternoon to speak to our reporter about the upcoming budget.

“So basically,” he said.

“He wants to give my retired parents more money, so they’ll give more money to me? How about you stop telling us what we want and perhaps listen to us?”

“I want everything my parents had but without all the unchecked quagmire of misogyny and racism that was the 1970s. They never had to struggle like me. God! This country is so fucking broken it makes my blood boil! Just find a solution, Malcolm. That’s what you’re job is.”

Hot Cross Buns To Replace Mi Goreng For Local Student This Week As Easter Foods Go On Special

TEXT:

At two dollars a six pack, Dale Peckham said the hot cross buns were hard to walk past down the supermarket this morning.

That and the kilo bags of generic Easter eggs, which were a modest $3.50.

We spoke to the chronically malnourished history student this morning in the cold meats section of the French Quarter Woolworths metro.

“This will feed me for a week,” said the 19-year-old South Betoota Polytechnic student.

“I’ve got 24 hot cross buns, three kilos of chocolate eggs and a stick of nice butter down the front of my trousers. I don’t shoplift every day but when I do, I shoplift from Woolworths because they rip farmers off and put profit before people. They’re not going to miss a stick of salted Lurpak, the bastards. I try to shop at the Fotox in Little Aarhus but they were on strike today. ”

“Anyway. It’ll be a nice change from Mi Goreng.”

However, in light Mr Peckham’s worrying admissions, The Advocate reached out to a number of local dieticians for comment.

Denise Palmer, from the Betoota Grove Wellness Centre, explained that Easter eggs and hot cross buns can be part of a healthy and balanced diet but if one exclusively eats them, that’s when you start having problems.

“Eating only chocolate eggs and hot cross buns for an extended period of time is not good for you,” she said.

“Problems you might encounter would probably be scurvy and gum disease. Possible tooth decay as well. And then there are the digestive issues,”

“I’d recommend adding organic vegetables and some good protein.”

Peckham said he’d take the recommendations on board but admits there’s not much wriggle room on the Austudy allowance.

“Sounds like I should be stealing more sirloin.”

Tweed Man Can Finally Take Off Second Watch As Daylight Savings Ends

TEXT:

As the curse of daylight savings comes to an end for another summer, a Tweed man breathed a sigh of relief as he took off his second watch which he uses to keep track of the time south of the border.

“It’s just part and parcel with living close to the border,” said Morris Goblin, a local small business owner.

“Many of my clients live south of the border so when discussing delivery times and whatnot with them, I need to be reminded of what the time is down there – hence the second watch, you see,”

“In a perfect world, a man wouldn’t need to keep a spare Timex in his glovebox but it’s the reality in which we live. Here’s a bit of trivia for you. If you fly to Coolangatta airport, odds are the wheels will touch down in New South Wales but you’ll pull up to the terminal in Queensland. Crazy, huh?”

Although people may laugh at him, especially the perennially whinging New South Welshanese, the 34-year-old e-commerce guru said his commitment to being punctual and professional often trumps his desire to be fashionable.

Another, more local, opponent of daylight savings spoke briefly to The Advocate today on this public holiday.

Our reporter discussed the issue with The Hon. Bob Katter, who explained that the very nature by which daylight savings exists is an affront to the Australian way of life.

“I don’t care much for daylight savings,” he said.

“What I do care about is jobs going overseas and foreign ownership of our valuable farming and mining land. I’ll tell you what, people would care a lot more about daylight savings if it was foreign owned, I’ll tell you that for sure.”

First-Year Journo Student Sighs And Says The World Needs Hunter S. Thompson Now More Than Ever

TEXT:

Home on his first uni break, a popular first-year journalism student has told friends and family that we’re all living in a ‘kingdom of fear’ and that the world needs fabled gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson now more than ever.

Bryce Waterman, who convinced himself to enrol in the print journalism course at South Betoota Polytechnic College (SBPC) this year, explained that the state and peace of the world has deteriorated so much that only the laser-like writing of the Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas author can save us.

“He had such a great bullshit detector,” said the middle-class, privately-educated youngster.

“A champion of any cause. In his first book, The Rum Diary, he refers to these people who make the bullshit as ‘bastards’. I don’t want to get into it now but that section of the ‘novel’ really stuck with me,”

“Which I why I chose to study journalism in the first place. Just imagine if Hunter lived to see what the world has become? Imagine if he got to see Trump? God, It’d be brilliant. We need Hunter right now.”

Waterman’s COM701: An Introduction To Journalism professor at SBPC tentatively agreed with his student, taking the time out of his peaceful Easter Sunday to speak to our reporter.

“I too would be interested in hearing what Hunter would have to say about this,” he said.

“Him and Joe Bageant. Joe wrote this book called Deer Hunting With Jesus: Dispatches From America’s Class War – which is fantastic. It might not have salt shakers of cocaine and month-long acid benders but it’s just as entertaining and horrifying as anything Hunter’s written,”

“Food for thought! Have a nice Easter!”

Survey: Local Newspaper Editors Struggle To Write April Fools Days Content In This Day And Age

TEXT:

A survey distributed and conducted by Baiame Consolidated Media, The Advocate’s owners, to local newspaper editors and owners has found that in 2018, it’s become increasingly difficult to produce engaging and high-quality April Fools Day content.

Five of the seven newspaper editors in the Betoota Newspaper Editors’ Guild responded to the survey highlighted that the relationship the media has with days such as today has ‘definitely changed’ in recent times.

“You can publish anything these days and even if it’s the most ridiculous thing you can think of,” said the South Betoota Echo‘s editor, Anya Marks.

“Somebody out there will believe it,” she said.

“Which was quite harmless just a few short years ago. Some people might’ve laughed at that person’s ignorance and dim-wittedness. Nowadays, you need to question everything you read because it just might be true. Today has been a rough day.”

The Echo‘s sentiments were echoed by Clancy Overell, the long-time editor of The Advocate.

However, it has always been the editorial policy of The Betoota Advocate not to engage in ‘such juvenile’ and ‘tasteless’ media pranks such as April Fools Day.

“We have not – and will never publish anything other than the truth and proper facts,” he said while peeling a mandarin, tossing the skin on the newsroom floor.

“We aren’t the Betoota Grove Courier or Journée Française. We are a real newspaper that keeps the funny business in the funny pages. There’s a smashing Garfield comic on page thirty-seven. It’s hilarious. We also have Sodoku on page forty if you’re worried about getting dementia.”

The three other newspaper editors did not respond to The Advocate’s request for comment on the survey.

Report: Putting Mate’s Mobile Number On Gumtree Selling Cheap Pit Bull Pups Is Hilarious

TEXT:

Only one person knows why Mike Guthrie’s phone has been ringing off the hook this afternoon – and he’s not about to reveal himself.

At least not to Mike.

Speaking candidly to The Advocate, one of Mike’s ‘friends’ told our reporter that the reason why his phone has been ringing non-stop since lunchtime is that he’s put an ad up for ‘cheap pit bull pups’ on the popular internet classifieds website, Gumtree.

“Mate, so funny,” said the friend, who asked to remain anonymous.

“Mike’s a real estate agent so he has to answer every call. Fuck man, seriously it’s so funny. A bloke in his office said he’s close to tears in frustration. I’ll take it down later on but I’ll let him suffer for the res tof the day,”

“Don’t tell him who’s done it! [laughs] Pit bull pups in Betoota Ponds! Genius!”

Betoota Ponds, on the southern end of the town’s third largest artificial lake, is home to the district’s bustling and cosmopolitan dog fighting district.

Shady men and women from all walks of life from around the country visit Betoota Ponds to both enjoy the dog fighting and take part in it.

Because of this popular toursit attraction, a steady supply of dogs such as pit bulls is needed to supply the industry.

The faux-ad priced each put at $250 – whereas a good, training adult with experience can fetch as much as a seventh-hand AU Fairmont.

The Advocate tried to reach out to Mike but couldn’t get through to his phone.

Lehmann, Handscome Confirm Chat On The Two-Way Was About The Ongoing Humanitarian Crisis In Syria

TEXT:

“You know, more than half a million people have been killed since the outbreak of the Syrian civil war in 2011,” said Darren Lehmann.

“Mate, that’s not even the start of it. The government of President Bashar al-Assad responded to Arab Spring protests with a bloody crackdown that’s spiralled into a full-blown civil war.”

Peter Handsome sat there in silence, staring out onto cow corner.

“Jesus, Boof,” he said.

“That doesn’t sound too good. What’s happening there now?”

Darren looked solemnly down at his shoes and took a deep breath.

“There’s a huge humanitarian crisis that’s seen a mass exodus from the conflict zones. Most have fled to Europe and neighbouring Turkey. Other to further afield like Canada, America and even Australia,” added the barrel-chested Aquarius.

“It’s a tragedy that doesn’t get spoken about nearly enough in the mainstream media. Do you think Peter Overton gives a fuck about the people of Idlib or Damascus? No! It’s time we change that; use our social currency for good.”

That was the official story Darren Lehmann gave to Cricket Australia CEO James Sutherland last night, local time.

And Sutherland, albeit sceptical, accepted that version of events happened.

“I’m satisfied that Darren and Peter were talking on the two-way about the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Syria. God, I can’t believe those words just came out of my mouth,”

“Even though both of them failed to locate the war-torn nation on Google Maps last night, I’m satisfied that they were both definitely in the dark regarding the ball tampering. The investigation into Darren Lehmann is now closed.”

Sutherland let out a heavy sigh and excused himself from the press conference.

Local Girl Hides Direct Attack On Roommate With Passive Message To Entire House

TEXT:

Although Jocelyn Arndt (21) used reasonably ambiguous language when questioning her housemates over social media today, she has told The Advocate that she is fully aware who ‘the milk theft culprit’ is.

“Oh yeah, I one hundred percent know it was who drank my milk,” said the share tenant in an old French Quarter house.

Arndt’s statement to The Advocate comes shortly after the university student sent out an extremely passive aggressive message to her 5 housemates, requesting information on the alleged petty theft.

The message read:

“Hey guys, can whoever it is that keeps drinking my milk please stop. I don’t actually care about the cost of it, but I went to grab it out of the fridge before there was barely a mouthful left, and I had to go down the road to get some more. It’s just that it’s really annoying to have to get more because someone can’t be bothered to get there own.

Ps, are we still watching Black Mirror tonight?”

Arndt told us that although she didn’t specifically name her housemate Grace, she may as well have, “because everyone knows it was her.”

“Yeah, she also always drink the water from the glass bottles in the fridge and never fills em up,” said Arndt.

“I am too much of a pussy to message her directly, doing it through the group chat with a veil of uncertainty protects me on a whole lot more levels.”

Recorded in the living room of Fork’s French Quarter sharehouse, the first episode went off with a bang.

The quartet spoke to The Advocate briefly from that very same room.

“We got a few downloads,” said John, shortly before receiving a backslap from Paul.

“Rome wasn’t built in a day!”

A sharp rising giggle filled the room.

“Nah! But Brisbane was!” said Greg as the room exploded into rapturous, atavistic laugher.

One of the housemates poked his head out to see what all the commotion was about downstairs – just as Fork’s eyes rolled back in the head in sheer ecstasy and he slid off the couch.

“I think I’ve shit my pants!” yelled Fork to even more laughter.

Now all of his housemates were now cowering at the top of the stairs like scared children, watching and listening to the chaos.

While the room slowly returned to an acceptable level of noise, Greg cough-laughed and said that these types of laughs were only a small sample of those on offer.

Our reporter, still gagging at the smell of Fork’s freshly lined britches, backed out of the room quickly while giving them all a double-thumbs-up.

Med Student Might As Well Be Studying Arts After Forgetting To Bring Stethoscope Today

TEXT:

Each morning at the Betoota Polytechnic Medical School (BPMS), the students there stand at attention before a lifesize photograph of The Hon Greg Hunt MP, Minister For Health – and recite the Med Students’ Creed:

This is my stethoscope. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

My stethoscope is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life.

Without me, my stethoscope is useless. Without my stethoscope, I am useless. I must use my stethoscope true. I must listen to heartbeat straighter than the malpractice board who is trying to take my stethoscope. I must do this him before he does me.

I Will.

But this morning, one student was asked to step outside while the creed was being said.

Tatum Bartram, who’s just started her penultimate years of undergraduate medical student, forgot her stethoscope this morning – meaning she might as well be a ‘smelly Arts student’ according to herself.

“I can’t believe I’ve done this,” she said.

“How are people supposed to know I study medicine if I’m not wearing my stethoscope? People might think I’m a nurse, I don’t know which is worse,”

“The price for forgetting your stetho[scope] as a med student at Betoota Polytechnic is huge and I’ll never play so hard and fast with my future again.”

Ms Bartram’s sentiments were echoed by the Head of Medicine a BPMS, Janine Crawford, who took time out of her busy morning to both throw her support behind young Tatum and outline just how important a stethoscope is to a medical student’s identity.

“They’re very important,” she said.

“Even though there’s many other more modern, more reliable ways to detect a heartbeat and listen to people cough, the stethoscope will always be needed. It doesn’t need power to work and the tech behind it is hundreds of years old,”

“To forget or lose your stethoscope as a med student is a cardinal sin. Tatum will be punished for this rare misstep and then we will move on.”

Pintrest To Begin Handing Out Honorary Interior Design Degrees

TEXT:

It has been revealed that stay-at-home interior designers might have a bit more weight to their opinion than you once thought, with social media sharing platform Pinterest now giving out degrees in interior design.

Pinterest launched in in March 2010 as a way for founder Bill Silbermann to get his wife to redesign their kitchen without him having to do anything. 

The popular online platform now boasts 175 million active users, 2 billion searches per month and a Teen Choice Awards nomination for Choice Social Network.

In a recent press conference, Silbermann announced the social giant’s plan to move into the education sector, citing the fact that ‘all Pinterest users are basically experts at interior design anyway’ as their reason for making the bold move.

“We all know someone who is a massive pin-head. Maybe they have two hundred pinboards, maybe it’s two thousand. The fact is, they know what they’re doing and deserve the accreditation that tells them so.”

This announcement has led to widespread outcry amongst the interior design industry, most notably The Block judge and winner of “Most Likely to be Named After Her Dad Award” Shaynna Blaze, who stated, “stunts like this undermine the noble profession of making indoors look nice.”

Pinterest claims to have already given out 10,000 degrees of interior design to mummy bloggers and women desperately trying to get their partner to consider redoing the spare room.

There’s no word yet of what Silbermann and the team at Pinterest will be trying next although unconfirmed sources have speculated degrees in nutrition for vegan/plant-based bloggers could be on the cards.

Sydneysider Picks Out A New Arctic-Grade Jacket For When The Mercury Starts Dipping Below 20

TEXT:

“We don’t get a real winter in this country,” explained Ben Ticehurst, like our reporter wasn’t already aware of that.

“But that doesn’t mean we can’t pretend.”

The visiting Sydneysider spent this morning struggling to park his Pajero at a 45-degree angle on Daroo Street while his partner, Ainara Boxford, turned her nose up at every cafe along the strip down from The Advocate’s offices.

Explaining over the district’s cultural breakfast, (a black coffee, two slices of buttered Vegemite toast and a John Player Special found down the side of a couch) the couple from the Harbour Capital remarked that it gets quite cold at night here in the desert.

“We were thinking we’d go down to Patagonia or Paul Reader and get a winter coat,” said Ben, wincing as he sipped the boiling hot, milkless coffee.

“Actually, Google is telling me that you’ve got a Canada Goose shop down the road. We’ll just head down there.”

Our reporter decided to join Ainara and Ben on their stroll down to the skiwear outlet district of town to see what they decided on.

Arriving at the Canada Goose shop, Ainara cleared her throat and spat in the gutter.

“Man,” she whispered.

“Are these things reds? Like 12mg? I can barely walk in a straight line.”

Ben laughed and ushered her inside to pick out a coat.

After what seemed like an hour, the couple picked out two Arctic-grade winter jackets. The type of jacket one might choose to pack when they climb Everest or equivalent.

“It’s like 20 back in Sydney right now,” he said.

“That’s fucked. But I’ll be nice a toasty in this coat. I could probably wear a t-shirt all year if I wanted but that’s not what I want. Hopefully, climate change will make it snow in Sydney this year. Just like in New York.”

Abbott Doubles Down On Conservative Vote And Says He’ll Knight George Pell If He Wins Power Again

TEXT:

Tony Abbott has revealed controversial plans to offer a knighthood to embattled Cardinal George Pell should he win power again over Malcolm Turnbull.

Speaking to the House this afternoon, the former prime minister said he’s looking to ‘out-conservative the conservatives in his party’ in a move aimed at stealing right-faction favour away from incumbent leader Peter Dutton.

“If this doesn’t work then I guess there’s no pleasing them,” said Abbott.

“People have told me that if I knight Cardinal Pell, it’ll make me even more unpopular – which I find hard to believe,”

“The hardest thing, in my opinion, will be passing the necessary legislation through both houses that’ll bring knighthood back. I don’t give a fuck. This is my Everest and I’ll climb it.”

The Advocate reached out to the Catholic church for comment on the proposed plan to knight Jesus’ repetitive in Australia but only received a Holy Bible laced with a white powder in return.

Never the less, a number of replies were received from other members of the House.

The Member for Kennedy, the Hon. Bob Katter took time out of his busy afternoon to fax his handwritten response back our offices.

“Gentleman, I received your email and yes, I am concerned,” wrote Mr Katter.

“There were many parts of Tony’s speech to parliament this afternoon that didn’t sit well with me. Knighting Cardinal Pell, in my opinion, would be a grave mistake to make,”

“At times, the speech made me physically ill. It was nothing short of disgusting. However, I couldn’t look away. Now, let me talk to you about this new vanadium business in Charters Towers…”

The 44-page response from Mr Katter is still being printed by the fax machine and it will be published in full once it’s finished and our intern figures out how to get the scanner working again.

Podcast Listener Stares Down Nose At The Simple Commuters Listening To Music

TEXT:

Riley Martin smiled to himself and relished in his own sense of self-worth; swinging by his wrist on the D45 Bus to the French Quarter this morning.

He’d just spied another commuter on the bus bobbing his head along to a Red Hot Chili Peppers track.

“What a dumb cunt,” he thought to himself.

The 27-year-old post-graduate barista is allowed to laugh because on the ride to work this morning, he was listening to an NPR podcast dedicated to the tearing in the socio-economic fabric that held the military Junta together in Argentina back in the late 70s and early 80s.

He spoke to The Advocate briefly moments after he got off the omnibus in front of his place of work, the Pisse Dans Ma Poche Cafe on Rue de Putain.

“It really digs deep into the root cause of the Falklands War,” he said cheerfully.

“Such a great example of realpolitik that’s often neglected. But I digress, back to your question. I don’t understand how people can just sit there and listen to music. Maybe because I don’t have a lesser mind? I don’t know. All I know is, is that I need a bit of mental stimulation in the morning that doesn’t come in the form of a Coldplay lyric.”

However, he recoiled back into his shell when our reporter asked Riley what he thought of people who read books on the bus – if he thinks they’re simple people as well?

“I would’ve read a book but I had to stand up for a woman, so it was impossible to read, you know what I mean?”

Our reporter said he didn’t.

“Look,” he said retrieving a book from his backpack.

“I bet you’ve never read this one because you’re a fucking scum journalist. Atlas Shrugged, have you heard of it? Of course, you haven’t. Fuck head. You know, you’d benefit from reading a bit of Ayn Rand. His work delves deep into why you do the shit you do.”

If you listen to interesting and thought-provoking podcasts like Riley – but also enjoy the odd Red Hot Chilli Peppers track, then you might like the podcast version of The Betoota Advocate’s radio show on Desert Rock FM.

Tom Ballard Says He’s Prepared To Call Bob Brown A ‘C–t’ In The Interest Of Fairness

TEXT:

Taxpayer-funded comedian Tom Ballard says he’s prepared to call his personal hero Bob Brown a ‘cunt’ live on air to appease conservatives.

The ABC’s Tonightly host needs to appease conservatives after his popular programme labelled a Batman byelection candidate from the Australian Conservatives a ‘cunt’ during a show earlier this week.

“The phone’s been ringing off the hook ever since,” said the skittish Victorian.

“[Cori] Bernardi even mailed a bullet to out writing room, telling us the next one will be coming a lot fucking quicker. Is that a death threat? It was only a .22 but I think the message was clear,”

“Anyway, to make the conservatives happy, I’ve agreed to get Bob Brown on the show. I’ll look him in the eye and call him a cunt to his face. It’s hard because I don’t think he’s a cunt, he’s actually a hero of mine. But I digress, it just needs to be done. As we say on the comedy circuit, it is what it is, then you die.”

Though it’s too early to tell if the move will make right-leaning people unoffended, according to the senior management team at the ABC but they’re remaining positive.

The ABC’s television director, David ‘Davo’ Anderson, took time out of his busy morning to speak to The Advocate regarding the controversy and the fallout surrounding the c-bomb.

“It’s not an ideal situation,” he said.

“But we’re glad Tom has elected to be the bigger man and call leftie Jesus a cunt on air so small-minded people think we’re not biased,”

“But it’s not my first rodeo, this’ll all blow over by tomorrow. Unless we’ve got another Chris Kenny-type migraine on our hands. Just as long as nobody gets shot or sued, I’m happy.”

Bloke Named Kane Congratulated For Not Being In A Stink For A While

TEXT:

A social circle engrained deep in Betoota’s working class Flight Path District are today congratulating one of their more hotheaded male friends, Kane (29), for not toweling anyone up for a while.

While his female friends say it’s a direct result of him having a nice girlfriend that they set him up with, his footy mates say that it has a lot to do with him giving up the rum and smoking a bit more hooter.

As of last count, it has been almost two years and three months since Kane’s last dip, following an incident with some of Roma boys out the front of the Lord Kidman Hotel on New Year’s Eve 2016.

It is not known if ‘Old Kane’ was acting out of a lack of emotional intelligence, or if it was because of pride – but his male friends say they always felt a little bit relieved walking past the hip hop venues when he was out and about.

“It’s been a while big fella. Good work” says close friend, Mark, after Kane’s lack of argy bargy was brought up in conversation.

Kane responds nonchalantly.

“Haha yeah. Those days might be behind me”

However, with a few yahoos at the back of the bar currently being inappropriate and making the girl’s feel weird as they walk back from the bathroom… Kane gets that scary old glint in his eye.

“Wait up.” he says.

“We might be on here”.

Man Instantly Regrets Washing Hair

The shampoo bottle looked him in the eye lied to his face.

This morning, a Betoota Heights man described his hair as ‘malleable and rugged’ – those aren’t the words he’d choose now.

Sam Chen, a popular local heritage architect, says he’s ruined his look by washing his hair has it’s now floppy and whispy.

“A live music venue in Sydney has more volume in it than my hair does now,” he said.

“And there’s more life in Stephen Hawking now than my hair. The label said it makes thin, straight hair ‘bouncy and manageable’ – which I’ve now determined to be a lie,”

“Christ, I look ridiculous. What am I going to do?”

The 28-year-old rang a close friend who knows more about hair than he does.

That friend was was Jenny Grose.

With his lavender-scented locks dancing softly on the hot desert wind blowing off the Simpson this afternoon, the smooth-haired Gemini poured his heart out to Jenny – who couldn’t offer him much in terms of a solution.

“Try keeping your hands in your pockets until they’re nice a sweaty then run them through your hair,” she said.

“Or maybe go for a fews sprints up a sand dune? I reckon sweat is the key.”

That’s not the answer Sam says he was looking for.

The search for answers is slated to continue long into the afternoon.

Half-Read Liane Moriarty Novel To Lie Dormant On Local Woman’s Bedside Table Indefinitely

TEXT:

“There will come a day when I will finish the book,” she said.

“Just when that is – I don’t know.”

Dona Mathers told our reporter that she wasn’t sure when she first picked up Truly Madly Guilty by best-selling Australian author Liane Moriarty. All she could confirm was that it was some time towards the end of last year.

She thinks.

Regardless, the 31-year-old said she’s been reading the book for months and she’s not even halfway.

“It’s a good read – so far,” she said.

“I just don’t have the time to read right now. There’s a lot going on. Most nights, I ust collapse into bed and browse a few Instagram stories before I nod off to sleep,”

“How people find the time to read is beyond me sometimes. I love a good book, don’t get me wrong. Truly Madly Guilty is a fantastic book. My mother loved it and gave me her copy. It’s just that life is so tiring.”

Ms Mathers’ mother, Elvina, explained to The Advocate that she often lends her daughter books that end up coming back dog-eared halfway through.

Through one understanding grimace to another, Mrs Mathers told our reporter that was concerned that her copy of Liane Moriarty’s best-seller wouldn’t be coming back until September at the earliest.

“I have so many more books to recommend Dona,” she said.

“But she takes so long to read them. I should’ve known 400 pages was too much for a tired young professional to plough through before bedtime. It’s like handing a kid The Fellowship of the Ring before you’ve handed them The Hobbit,”

“Live and learn.”

Yuppie’s Morning In Ruins After Getting Stuck Behind The Garbage Truck

TEXT:

The fabled French Quarter in the heart of town is known throughout this district for its cosmopolitan cafe scene and the narrow, windy roads that criss-cross the suburb.

This morning, the latter caught out Dylan Connor-Hunter as he found himself buzzing the windows of his late model Range Rover Sport up in disgust.

He was caught behind a garbage truck – the very same garbage truck that services his Art Deco apartment block on Rue De Putain.

“Fuck,” he said softly, just enough to be heard over the Justin Timberlake trickling out of the Bang & Olufsen speakers.

“This is just what I needed!”

So much was the inconvenience, the 38-year-old public relations executive slapped the calfskin wrapping the centre of the steering wheel, letting out a faint but audible beep.

Both of the hardworking garbologists swinging off the back of the garbage truck heard the rude toot and made their grievances known.

Mike Greenbow, a long time Shire Council garbage collector, reached into the back of the truck and retrieved an empty of Cobram extra-virgin olive oil to throw at Dylan’s sporty soft-roader.

And with a firm flick of the wrist, the $9 bottle flew through the air and into the centre of the Range Rover’s windscreen – cracking it.

Dylan immediately applied the brakes as the hot flush of fear and panic burst into his facial capillaries.

“Ah!” he squeaked.

He toyed with the idea of doing something about it – but ultimately decided to put his trilby in the glovebox and accept his new social pegging.

Local Girl Shares Extravagant Travel Plans As RSVP To Low-Key Birthday Drinks Back Home

Bazza’s 30th was supposed to be just a relaxed Friday afternoon drinks at his favourite pub. It was one of those things where, if you can make it, good… If you can’t, oh well.

But his girlfriend’s work friend’s girlfriend must have missed how casual it was going to be.

Despite being at the level of friendship where she is not even expected to RSVP whether she is going or not, Sally has jumped at the chance to be clear about why she won’t be able to attend this event.

By offering her current international travel itinerary to the entire invitee list, Sally has also invited Bazza to share anything he might know about a tourism hotspot he’s never been to.

“Sorry Baz. Can’t make it – Jamie and I will most likely be drinking cocktails in Phuket on the 30th. Let us know if you have any suggestions for Thailand. Will have to catch up when we get back. landing the weekend after xx”

The post was joined by several other oversharing friends who posted similar excuses, none quite as indulgent as Sally’s – however, some did explain that there was another social event on that night for some reason.

Student Begins To Die Internally Telling Classmates ‘A Little About Himself’ During University Icebreakers

TEXT:

“John, stand up and tell the class a little bit about yourself,” said the Professor.

He stood up and began to talk.

“No, come to the front of the class and do it.”

A hot flush ran out of his stomach and into his extremities; his face felt hot.

He shuffled to the front of the class and cleared his throat.

“Hi, my name is John,” said the 21-year-old.

“This is my second go at uni. I came here right out of school and just got way too into my bongs and fucked everything up. Lost good friends, my girlfriend left me for some double-polo-shirt-wearing-rugby-union-fuck-boy. But, ah, I’m originally from Brisbane and I like playing golf in my spare time.”

But that wasn’t enough.

“What are you studying? Are you in second or third year?”

John smiled and looked away at his shoes.

“You know exactly what I am, you jibbering old cunt,” John thought to himself.

But rather than say that, in the unpleasantly warm second-floor classroom in Building B of the Betoota Polytechnic College, he elected to nervously laugh and play ball.

“If I wasn’t such a bag of shit, I would’ve been done by now. Yeah, but oi nah, I’m a second-year media student. Looking forward to getting this course done so I can go work in a pub for two or three years until I get a job selling media for some soulless media buying agency in the big smoke.”

And with that, John’s professor nodded and said thank you.

Next up in the hot seat was Lucy Bluespoon, who was equally as amused to tell these strangers something about herself.

The cycle was said to have continued until the entire class had presented something.

However, the college board refused to comment on whether the ice was sufficiently broken enough to warrant the exercise in the first place.

Sketchy Bloke At Train Station Looking At You Like You’re The Sketchy One

TEXT:

Red-faced with a prickly silver 20-day growth, local greasy hoodie wearer is spending his day at Sydney’s Central station looking at you like you’re the sketchy one.

The man, known only as ‘Ken,’ has set many commuters on edge all day, by staring at them as they walk past with a questioning look hanging on his half-toothed face.

“He was staring at me like I had a bomb in my bag and he was going to stop me. Far out, I’m still shivering.”

Reports state that Ken spent the entire morning staring intensely through his bloodshot eyes at those going about their day, pausing only to scab a cigarette or ask for $2.50.

Rail staff say this is ‘normal’ behaviour for Ken, who state while they see Ken regularly – they have never seen him eat, sleep or use the bathroom.

“There’s a guy who has been working here for 30 years who said Ken was there on the day he started. He says he looks exactly the same except maybe he’s changed his shirt.”

According to witnesses, the situation escalated at approximately 2:30pm when Ken was joined by a man known only as ‘Ron,’ and together they doubled their staring efforts with a twin gaze that reportedly frightened a bouncer on his way to work, a roller derby team and a pair of on-duty police officers.

“It’s fine, they’re probably not up to anything. You’d think I was though they way they were looking at me.”

Speaking exclusively with The Advocate, Ken laughed a deep maniacal cackle when questioned about his strange stares before gesturing to a black and white photo on the station wall dated 1901 that features a man matching his appearance as the original conductor of the station.

Framed Photo Of Uncle Slim Takes Pride Of Place Above Fridge In Murri Grandma’s Kitchen

TEXT:

An entire extended family of Betootan Blackfellas have today sat patiently through Gran’s story about the time she met Uncle Slim Dusty at old hall concert in the late 70s.

“He was just like that in real life” she says, pointing to the framed photo of the iconic Australian country musician that sits above the Worcestershire Sauce and SAXA salt on top of the kitchen fridge.

“I’ve never listened to any country music since then. Except for Dolly”

As is a common occurrence in many blackfella households around the country, the iconic Slim Dusty is essentially considered an honorary Murri – considering it’s quite clear that he’s not black, but he’s not just any old whitefella.

As is evident in his legacy of the unequalled 38 Golden Guitar awards, Slim Dusty is recognised as one of the earliest public figures in post-White Australia that had the ability to unite both black and white audiences, with his now canonised ballads about love and life on the land.

In fact, when it comes to white crooners, she says the only one who comes close is Uncle Paul [Kelly].

According to Gran, none of the thousands of Australian guitarists that came after Slim Dusty – except for Paul, Dan, Kev and Archie – can even compare to the dulcet tones of the 100-album country artist from Kempsey.

Dad Already Getting His Strog On Minutes After Mum Leaves For Weekend With Her Sisters

TEXT:

With Dire Straits playing in the background, dad is already in the kitchen whipping up his favourite meal. Beef stroganoff.

These reports come just minutes after mum pulled out of the driveway blowing kisses, before heading off to spend the weekend with her sisters down the coast.

While, dad doesn’t view necessarily his suspiciously chirpy behaviour as a form of microcheating, he does acknowledge that it is very naughty.

Due to the traditional Australian cuisine’s high carb, high cream and low vegetable count – the old boy isn’t allowed to eat this shit that often. So he’s quick to jump on it.

Given the time is just after midday, it is not clear when dad actually plans on eating this meal. By the time it’s finished, it could either be a late lunch or an early dinner – or what is most likely, a grazing trough that sits on the stovetop for him to keep returning to for the duration of the weekend.

“Don’t tell your mother he says”

“She knows I’m gonna get my strog on… But I’m making a fair bit here”

“If she does ask, tell her I boiled up some honey carrot to go with it”

Everyone was very excited to learn that Mitchy Wheeler had gotten his licence today, and no one more than him.

As a self-confessed “car-lover” since his early teens, Mitchy had been saving up his whole life for the car that he and his dad went halves in two months ago. Right in time for his driver’s test.

Unfortunately, this kind of dedication, responsibility and long-term thinking also makes Mitchy the square of his group – and even though his mates are just as stoked to be able get driven around… There’s just so many rules.

“Oi, arm in the window you fuckstick” says Mitchy, as he does a triple take on both side mirrors, rear view and out his passenger window in one fluid movement.

“In fact, put the windows up. No yelling”

“I’m only on my red Ps, dickhead. I’m not even allowed to have this many people in the car in half an hour. Who’s house are we going to?”

Even though Mitchy won’t allow any form of opened alcohol containers in the car – he is very willing to do as many maccas runs as anyone wants.

Only if they eat in the restaurant, as his good friend Tim discovered the hard way after getting discovered nibbling some left over chips on the trip home.

“Oi” says Mitchy.

“Can you NOT eat food in my [1997 Subaru Impreza]”

“You Can’t Get Guinness Like This Back Home” Says Man Who’s Never Had A Guinness Back Home

Leaning over the bar at his new Dublin local, Sam Canterwell explained to his new friend the barman that the Guinness back home in South Betoota isn’t half as good as it is in the Republic.

“You know they make it in Australia with this concentrate? Like a glass of fucking cordial it is,” he said with a faux, weak D4 accent.

“Not like here, this is mother’s milk. I love Dublin, I reckon I could live here, I could. Only place you can get a good Guinness in the world. Those Diageo soyboys can’t spoil it here. I’ve heard this is an IRA pub? Are there any of them here I can get a selfie with?”

Unbeknown to the 19-year-old holidaymaker, two other friends in his travelling party told our reporter via Skype this morning that Sam had his first Guinness two days ago upon their arrival in the Irish capital.

Which makes his declaration and opinion invalid, says friend Peter Smoothgooch.

“Sam, to my knowledge, has never had a Guinness back home. Not even at Jack Duggin’s in the French Quarter. They’ve got the best Guinness in Betoota but Sam wouldn’t know that because he’s the type of degenerate that’d ‘butt-chug’ a whole bottle of Pinot Gris,” said Smoothgooch.

“We look forward to going to Copper Face Jacks tonight having some more pints of Guinness,”

“Perhaps we might even have a lager. Then Sam will start telling people you don’t get good Coors Light back in Australia. Anyway, I’m half pissed on holidays so I don’t know why I complaining. You know he’s got his Dad’s Amex in his wallet for emergencies. The only emergencies we’ve had so far have involved getting pints and asking dodgy-looking people if they can get us some co-kay-eee-na.”

Mate On Court-Ordered Curfew Tells Nightclub Photographer To Go Fuck Himself

TEXT:

A mate that has been a bit naughty over the last few months has thrown out a proposition. He reckons this pub is shit and that he’s got plenty of grog back at his place.

Benson (23) has always been keen for a big night out, but ever since his string of drink driving offences and a rather violent confrontation with some dumb bushies at the Ekka last year, he’s really trying to keep it tidy.

This is mainly because Benson is on a court-appointed curfew which could probably see him thrown into the can if gets spotted in a licensed venue after 10pm.

The rest of his mates try to be as gentle with him as possible, knowing that he’s going to be suffering cabin fever over the next six months.

After accidentally finding himself in the frame of the night club photo guys camera, Benson is starting to get a bit jumpy.

“Don’t put that on Facebook cunt. I’m not meant to be here”

“Go fuck yourself” he says to the cameraman, before turning back to his mates and pushing for an early exit.

“Come on. Tell the chicks to come back to my place. It’ll be better than this joint”

After an annoying campaign to have all of his mates change their entire plans to suit his legal status, Benson I essentially told to fuck off and that no one is really keen on pissing up on his verandah while his old man inside watching movies.

$17 Bottle Of Pale Ale From Airport Bar Really Hitting The Spot

TEXT:

It wasn’t his first choice of drink, but Dustin Mulloway threw caution to the wind and treated himself to a John Candy’s Ventricle Blowout Pale Ale at the airport before he heads off to America tonight on business.

The popular craft beer is made locally and went on sale at the Runway Bar over at Remienko International Airport earlier this year to great fanfare.

However, it’s price tag has meant many have stayed away. Especially when there are other better, cheaper and normal beers such as Betoota Bitter on offer.

But not Dustin.

“It’s really hitting the spot,” said the 28-year-old grain trader.

“First up, it was a bit hard on the mouth. Real bitter, or sour. I’m not sure. The bloke behind the bar said they double hop it or something. I just smiled and did that fake laugh thing people with limited social skills do like me,”

“Anyway. I’m happy. Beer is cold and I’m headed off on a bit of a trip.”

When asked by our reporter if he was going to have another, he did that fake laugh thing again and said absolutely not.

“I’m not made of money and beers like this aren’t sessionable. If I had more than four or five of these things, I’d need The Barefoot Investor to help me out of the debt and Charlie Teo to fix my migraine.”

“Argh! Winter sucks! But I am looking forward to walking on all those crunchy leaves! heart emoji.”

Salesman Confirms Rumours That He A Soulless Husk Of A Human Being

TEXT:

The Betootacone Valley tech start-up scene attracts the best and brightest young people in the country.

From far and wide they come.

Steven George is one of the lucky ones who gets to suckle at the teet of tech every day of his life.

But behind those soft brown eyes, there is nothing.

There is nothing because this sprightly 29-year-old is a tech salesman.

“I am dead on the inside and I have no soul,” he said.

“Your soul dies when you become a salesman. They don’t tell you that in salesman school. In fact, I did a degree in media communications. I wanted to be a journalist. Now I cold call companies and try to sell them something they don’t really need,”

“To quote the immortal Bard himself, I used to care – but things have changed. He got an Oscar for that song, you know. You probably don’t even care. I don’t even care.”

The product that Steven is tasked with selling people is ClickMagnet, which is something he can barely explain.

“It helps companies and online retailers stay connect with their customers – or something like that,” he said.

“In reality, it’s just a bit of javascript you inject into the header.php file. Amazing, huh?”

He rubbed his hands up and down the front of his pilling MJ Bale suit pants and looked at the ground.

“Maybe I should move to London? Isn’t that what young people do in this country when they don’t know what else to do?”

Farmer Thanked By Pathetic Inner-City Resident For His Next Meal

TEXT:

“Oh my God, thank you for these chickpeas,” he said.

“We don’t eat meat Monday to Friday and these will go great the vegan tagine I’m cooking tonight. Thank you so, so much. Katie, you’re doing God’s work out there. Keep it up! ‘kay thanks, bye!”

That’s the seventh phone call local grazier and farmer Kate Lauritsen has fielded today from residents in more cosmopolitan areas of the state.

Her family property, about an hour to the north of the Betoota City Limits, produces beef, lamb, wool and the occasional crop.

Last year, she grew chickpeas.

“The phone’s been ringing off the hook,” she said.

“We thought it was bad back in 09/10 when we grew quinoa. These Trad-based vegans down in New Farm are something else. It’s basically on the hour now, folk ringing up the house phone wanting to speak to a farmer. Didn’t think anybody would actually take those bumper stickers seriously.”

Lincoln Queeve, who phoned Kate just before to thank her for growing the chickpeas he’s going to eat tonight, said he did take those ‘Thank a Farmer’ bumper stickers seriously.

The bearded advertising executive told The Advocate that without people like Kate growing food for him, he would probably starve to death.

“I just take a moment to phone a farmer to say thanks,” he said.

“When they started putting their phone numbers on the can, it made it so much easier. Not like McDonalds. If they think the meat in my 4am $2 McDouble came from a prime Glen Innes Angus cow, they’re drinking their own Kool-Aid,”

“But yeah, I always take the time to make a farmer feel valued. It’s a hard thankless job that’s tough at times.”

Tasteless Public Servant Distances Himself From Latest Public Artwork Backlash

TEXT:

The case against Councillor Tom Carton is building today as the fallout from the latest French Quarter public art project has a community divided.

Councillor Carton, who is the youngest son of Betoota Lord Mayor, Cr Keith Carton AM SC, has been criticised heavily in local media this week for commissioning ‘one of the most visually offensive pieces of public art’ in recent memory.

The ‘Fountain of Youth’ sculpture on Rue de Lapin cost the community close to $500 ooo.

Those criticising the 27-year-old public servant have outlined that the artist behind the polarising artwork is a close friend of Tom’s – having both attended college together in Brisbane.

However, as pressure mounts on Councillor Carton, he’s begun to distance himself from the project.

“I didn’t have final say on the artwork,” he said.

“My relationship with Simon Beneau, the artist, was not as close as the media would suggest. We were acquaintances at university and those images of the both of us hazing fresher fucks together have been digitally manipulated. They are fake,”

“This morning at the town meeting, I will move a motion to have the sculpture pulled from the ground with Mr Jack Pearson’s D6. It will then be sold for scrap and the proceeds of that sale returned to the people of Central Betoota.”

Never the less, not every resident of the exclusive, cosmopolitan French Quarter district is pleased with the plan to demolish the eyesore.

Dame Wendolyn Cotfire, an ageing local heirless whose chequebook ultimately defines what is good art and bad art, said she’ll be sad to see the sculpture go.

Speaking exclusively to The Advocate, Dame Cotfire said she’s prepared to buy the artwork for her own private collection.

“A progressive and inclusive community such as the one we’ve fought hard to build here in South West Queensland shouldn’t destroy art, we aren’t savages, we should be praising it,” she said.

“I will start a campaign to save the artwork because I’m too old and too rich to bother myself with anything else.”

The Advocate reached out to the artist behind the artwork but have yet to receive a reply.

Middle Aged Fan Of Blues Music Rocks Pork Pie Hat In Bold Expression Of Individuality

TEXT:

A local father of 3 has this week decided he would begin wearing a pork pie hat, in an effort to remind people that he is his own man.

Paul James, 46, purchased the classic-yet-unique fashion accessory at the City Beach boutique, whilst visiting Pacific Fair Shopping Centre on a current family trip to the Gold Coast.

Although maintaining a cool demeanor, Mr James, who works in administration duties at Betoota City Council, admitted he was quite excited by his purchase, and that it was worth every bit of the price tag and the mild tension that followed when he returned to his wife.

“I think it really represents where I’m at in life right now” Paul explained. “Having done all the right things in recent years, but I’m a unique guy. I played in a blues band and we were signed to a label. I watch the ABC and I read Peter Carey. It’s a humble way of saying that I’m a generally just a bit better than the common folk” he said.

“When my kids hit their teens I think they’ll really appreciate having a Dad who gets them and who’ll hang out with them and all of their friends”.

James’ workmates echoed his sentiments. “He’s always been a pretty cool character” said Donny Rudd, who sits at the work station next to James’.

“I often hear the latest up-and-coming music through the partition; Vance Joy, Chet Faker, Holy Holy. And he always has great suggestions for everyone at the pub on Friday’s”.

Paul said he’s very much looking forward to heading back to Betoota and wearing his hat around town and dabbling in casual academia.

“No, You Didn’t Wake Me Up” Lies Man Fielding Sunday Morning Phone Call From Mum

TEXT:

About two hours ago local time, John Douglas’ phone rang loud enough to wake him up.

It was 11 am on this bright Sunday morning when his mother, Boral, decided to give him a ring.

“I thought he’d be up by now,” she said.

“I think I might’ve woken him up.”

John told our reporters that he was ‘kind of asleep’, in the state just prior to waking up.

Never the less, he was able to confirm that he was sleeping when his mother rang.

“When Mum rang me this morning, she asked if she’d woken me up. Of course, she did but I think it’s a bad look to still be stone-cold dead to the world at 11 am on a Sunday,” he said.

“So I lied. I told her that I’d been up for ages and my voice was croaky because I was getting sick.”

When asked by our reporter if she thought John was lying to her, Boral said yes.

“He’s always ‘getting sick’ every Sunday,” she said.

“I was young once, believe it or not. If he was still in bed at 11 am on a Tuesday or something, that’s when I’d be concerned.”

Local 19-Year-Olds About To Get Married Surprisingly Not Christians

TEXT:

“What the fuck is wrong with you?”

Timothy Camry and Marcia Blasket have been hearing that a lot in recent weeks.

Though they’ve been exclusive for nearly three years now, they’re both still young enough to be arrested for enjoying a glass of chilled, wooded Chardonnay on a hot Californian afternoon.

Young enough to prompt the question: “Why are you two getting married?”

The 19-year-olds wanted to make it clear to The Advocate that there’s no Jesus in their decision to get married next month – they just like the idea of entering into a lifelong legal contract with somebody they can stand to be around for longer than 5 minutes.

“Were not Christians,” said Marcia.

“Yeah, a lot of people expect us to be Christians. Believe me when I say we’re far from Christians,” added Tim.

Marcia smiled.

“If Jesus was a fly on the wall of our bedroom, he’d get back in the tomb and ask his disciples to roll the boulder back over the door. We’re the Burke and Wills of sexual exploration,” she said.

But that fact hasn’t satisfied the leafy enclave of Betoota Grove’s lust for gossip.

Late last year, a young Christian couple from Betoota Heights, just a few months younger than Tim and Marcia, got married so Jesus wouldn’t be crushed when he found out they’re been doing the horizontal Riverdance out of wedlock.

However, things have since gone pare-shaped.

The couple, who asked to remain anonymous as they fear persecution from the church, say they discovered that while they enjoyed each other’s company, they weren’t wholly compatible.

“She’s already left,” said the young churchgoer.

“And she took half my savings. They were my savings, too. I wanted to buy a new Telecaster for the band I’m in. She also got the PT Cruiser, I loved that car. I thanked God for it every day,”

“The judge basically laughed at me and got the bailiff to hold me upside down and shake the change out of my pockets. I’d warn anybody considering getting married before they’re 30 to really look at themselves in the mirror and ask if this is what they really want.”

Pantry Overflows With Weird Snacks After Housemate Does Groceries Blazed Again

TEXT:

A kitchen in Betootas brownstone district is overflowing this evening as one of its occupants went to the shops during the time between having a smoke after work and having dinner.

Scottie Green, a fourth year apprentice sparky, decided to head to Woolies in the early evening after discovering Kelly, his house-mate, had gone and bought Nesquik.

Two hours later, when Kelly went to make some dinner, she discovered the pantry completely choc-a-bloc with all sorts of weird snack foods.

“it’s ridiculous” she said, slowly opening the doors. “He knows I’m trying to be healthy and there’s 5 packets of fucking gingerbread men in here. Who even eats gingerbread men? He’s grabbed stuff from that weird little European section with the long-life baked goods.”

A quick scan around the shelves revealed 3 packets of heavily-discounted cinnamon donuts, 2 bags of cheesymite scrolls, 4 of the large boxes of Nutri-grain, beef jerky, wasabi peas, 2 packs of space food sticks, Cheezels, Rollups, some roasted walnuts, craisins and a pack of honeycomb flavoured Malteasers.

“Yeah wasn’t the best idea” sighed Scottie. “I was way too blazed to go in there. I’m fucking broke now. The bill came to like $900. FML”.

After emptying a tub of Ben & Jerry’s, Scottie insisted we take a pack of cinnamon donuts on our way out. “They’re about to expire”.

BREAKING: Dad Looks Like He’s Been Listening To Springsteen Again

TEXT:

Though his coal mining days have long passed and his life is now full of one mild regret after another, Peter Grince’s children tell The Advocate that he often finds solace in the music of Bruce Springsteen.

After he’s done listening to the Immortal Bard, the 67-year-old often looks disconnected from his surroundings.

He seems quite and deep in thought – as he was this afternoon when our reporter joined the Grince family in humble Betoota Heights home.

“See, this is what he does after he’s been in the shed listening to Bruce,” said his daughter, Amy.

“That song about going down to the river so something. He just sits in there and lets the song play over and over again. Dad just looks into space and tunes in. It’s amazing how his generation could actually just listen to music and be entertained by it.”

Peter’s son, Will, agreed.

“Yeah, it’s almost like the music takes him back to when he was like my age. Crazy huh? But the music is super depressing but, it’s all about coal mines shutting, workers strikes, illegal street racing and fast women who seem to live to break hearts.”

But neither of the kids are particularly worried about their old man; both understand that periods of deep introspection come more frequently as people get older.

Our reporter spoke briefly to Peter, who confirmed that he was feeling a bit scattered today.

Loyal QANTAS Customer Proud Of The Fact That He Pays More Tax Than The Entire Airline

TEXT:

Despite claiming the odd few things he shouldn’t, and lying here and there when he lodges some of his returns, Sam Nicholson still pays a pretty reasonable amount of tax.

As a secondary teacher in Betoota he gets some tax incentives as an employee in the public sphere, but overall he pays roughly 15-20 grand a year in tax.

Which is 15-20 grand a year more than the iconic and once national airline pays every year.

“Pretty stiff, isn’t it? That an ordinary kind of guy like me pays more than one of the largest companies in Australia hey,” he said to one of our reporters this morning.

Despite announcing a record first-half profit of $607 million dollars this morning, QANTAS has shown no tax payable for the last few years.

Sam Macedon, a member of Betoota’s Young Liberal explained to us that there is nothing illegal in what QANTAS and other big companies not paying any tax.

“It’s the way the system is. You can’t blame them for the fact that they can legally avoid paying tax by hiring large accounting firms to fabricate losses for consecutive years, restructure holdings, lie about their assets and give the ATO the run around because it’s ballless,” he laughed.

“That’s the way the system works boys.”

Macedon said that although the company could afford to pay its CEO $25 million dollars last year, it’s directors 7 figure salaries and dividends to shareholders, there was nothing wrong with tax laws that allow companies like QANTAS to claim losses.

Nicholson, however, wasn’t so understanding of the QANTAS lack of taxable income.

“I understand that it’s all ‘legal,’ but that doesn’t mean that it’s not a complete crock of shit does it. The fact that people like you and I are asked to pull our weight and contribute to the system, that the corporate fat cats are at the same time rorting the fuck out of,” he said.

“Yeah. Give me a break.”

Refreshing Tracking Information Every 10 Mins Found To Make Parcels Arrive 20% Faster

“I paid for express postage,” she said.

“Where is my jacket? I ordered and paid for it on Monday and it still says it’s in Melbourne? Next working day my fucking arse!”

Jenny Gilmour is pissed off.

The 24-year-old wants to the Gorman jacket, currently sitting motionless in an Australia Post depot on the northern fringe of the Yarra Republic, on Friday but at this point – it’s not looking good.

“I’ve refreshed the tracking information like a million times and it hasn’t changed at all. What’s the go?”

The go is, according to a representative from the national postage service, is that the parcel’s speed at which his moves are dictated directly by how much one refreshes a tracking number.

Speaking candidly to The Advocate, the postal worker said they can see who’s been refreshing the most and prioritise them accordingly.

“It can make your parcel arrive up to 20% faster,” they said.

“Our software can keep track of who’s most keen to get their online shopping. Rather than let them wait in pain, we make a special effort to get them their package quickly,”

“So the message is from us here at Australia Post is to keep mashing refresh.”

Report: Working In Advertising All Fun And Games Until Somebody Loses A Big Client

TEXT:

The blame game has started down at Colenso BBDO’s South Betoota office this afternoon after news broke that local chainsaw and lawnmower retailer, Perry’s Husqvarna, has dropped them for another local agency.

Short of being stabbed to death with a broken Ridell wine glass by John Singleton outside a popular steakhouse, the agency’s creative director and senior partners have been locked in crisis meetings since lunch and the mood around the open-plan office is grim.

Moments ago, Colenso Betoota’s CEO, Mathilda Carmichael, was seen berating and screaming at the creative director, Peter Ortophellatio.

“You fucking idiot,” she yelled.

Peter’s response was muffled by the plate glass separated him and the others from the accounts department.

“I don’t care about your fucking vision, you FitBit fuckwit! I care about making fuck-ing money. Without it, you’ll be back on the bendy bus with every other tieless, breastfed creative in your department!”

“Do you understand me? Huh?! Look at me! Perry’s brought in $10 000 a year to this company. So when I say give me solid pitch for a chainsaw brand., I don’t mean come back with a concept involving a talking catfish and a celebrity endorsement from Guy Sebastian. Understand?”

With that, Peter and the other faceless agency people in the meeting room got up and walked out.

Mathilda let out another large F-bomb before slamming the glass door behind her.

Situations such as these are all too common in agencies, according to Australia’s peak scientific body.

The CSIRO has spent close to a year looking at the work culture of many local PR/Advertising agencies in the wider Diamantina and Eromanga Basin – and what they uncovered was damning.

The organisation’s findings were released in a report earlier this week which outlined that working in a large agency is great until somebody loses a large client.

“People start to get fired when that happens,” says the CSIRO’s Mark Borch.

“All the giggles, fun and late-night disabled toilet nosé go out the window when some big brand marketing director turns off the tap. That’s what our research indicates, anyway,”

“In these events, when someone loses a big client, the CSIRO would advise that it’d be best to take the stabbing from John Singleton, file a complaint in civil court and hope for a large payout.”

MMA Coach Feels His Student Is Ready To Go On His First Carnival Cruise

TEXT:

After close to a year of intensive training, a local boxing coach feels one of his star students is ready for the big time.

Lloyd Cressford, according to his coach Darcy Potter, is finally prepared to go on his first Carnival Cruise – where he’s expected to fight close to two dozen people.

The 24-year-old fighter says he’s excited to reset a smorgasbord of brains across the South Pacific this April but admits there still a lot of work to do before he’s ready.

“I’m not sure how I’ll go having a chair broken over my back but I know I’d be able to knock out any security guard they throw at me,” he said.

“Plus, I can kick the head off a bloke without jumping. Last winter I kicked a bloke so hard in the head, the stitching on the side of my ugg boot was bruised into his face,”

“I’m glad Darcy is backing me to go on a Carnival Cruise. It’s basically like spending a month at war for a humble boilermaker like me. It will be a challenge but not one I’ll fail.”

A spokesman from Carnival Cruise lines say they’re excited to welcome Mr Cressford aboard – but have stopped short of saying he should fight anybody while travelling with them.

Though the company said it’s inevitable that their customers will be involved in a melee at some point during their cruise, they’ve asked that they simply walk away from it.

“Some guests who don’t want to take part in the fighting can bet on the fighters like they would at a cockfight,” said the Carnival official.

“But we ask that professional fighters, such as Mr Cressford, make themselves know to the opponents so they know what they’re getting themselves in for,”

“Carnival Cruise Lines have a long and proud history of being the premier fighting cruise line in the world. We look forward to hosting many more deadly combat events in the future.”

Amateur Theatre Company To Unapologetically Butcher ‘Cats’ For The Next 6 Weeks

TEXT:

The artistic director of the Betoota Grove Theatre Association (BGTA) announced today that there will be no formal apology made to Andrew Lloyd Webber after the group told reporters they plan to butcher his landmark musical ‘Cats’ for the next 6 weeks.

Hyacinth Gynt, who’s been at the helm of BGTA for nearly a decade, remains unapologetic after critics panned the local production over the weekend.

With mild anticipation and fanfare, Saturday night saw all the big names in town turn out for the opening night down at the Glasshouse Theatre.

Though nobody had high expectations, this year’s offering from BGTA was especially offensive to those who hold a season Glasshouse ticket.

“It was shocking; they absolutely butchered it,” said Maria Overell, wife of The Advocate’s editor, Clancy.

“Clancy had four bottles of white wine with two smoked oysters on a Jat for tea, which is usually enough to make him feel normal but even this performance put him to sleep. The singing even made him wince in his sleep,”

“Words escape me to describe just how terrible it was. You really ought to have been there. You’ll have able opportunity, it’s got a six-week run.”

Never the less, some audience members had the opposite opinion to Mrs Overell’s.

As nearly all the performers were under the age of 18, a number of parents made it out for the occasion to cheer their youngsters on.

With a Sony HandiCam in the palm, Brett Dennison, who’s youngest Emma is playing the role of Griddlebone, said the opening night was magical.

“Em was just great,” he said.

“But if you compare her performance to say someone like Cate Blanchett or Hugo Weaving, I guess it’d be pretty shit house but we’re not, are we? This is an amateur theatre company in South West Queensland,”

“And as a 47-year-old mortgage specialist, this is about as interesting as my life will ever get. I didn’t mind.”

Local Bankers Chuffed To Learn Royal Commission Is Now Out Of The News Cycle

TEXT:

Down by the banks of the French Quarter’s largest artificial lake, local bankers congregate at a popular licenced premise to socialise, talk about money, laugh at by-the-hour workers pouring money into cryptocurrency and above all, sigh in relief that the Joyce saga has relegated the Royal Commission into banking back to page seven.

They called it ‘The Rowing Shed’ well before it was officially named that.

Prior to Mike Watson-White buying the waterside pub, it was called Miguel’s Bar And Grill – that name never stuck.

“We [a consortium of ex-rugby union players turned ‘agribusiness analysts’] renamed it The Rowing Shed because it’s next door to the Whooton School’s boat shed and a lot of the finance workers in town went to that school,” said Watson-White.

“It’s always been a popular spot for the upper-middle-class as well as though who were born into the plain old middle-class that aspire to one day be upper,”

“The old money doesn’t come down here, though. They drink at the Country Club. Anyway, the mood was kinda [sic] down for quite a while because of this Royal Commission into Banking business. But now that the Joyce saga has shifted the public interest away from it, everybody is happy again.”

One local finance worker who told our reporters that he’s ‘chuffed’ is Tom Robinson, a 28-year-old former state rugby player who got a job through his network established at The Whooton School.

However, he feels that the timing of the whole thing is a little funny.

“If you ask me,” he said, taking the top off his sixth pint yesterday afternoon in the Rowing Shed beer garden.

“This whole thing with Barnaby Joyce is a false flag. I reckon Malcolm and his mates from Goldman have cooked this whole thing up as a distraction. Mate, I’m telling you. We’ve pulled so much money out of the blue-chip banking sector and put it into mining this quarter,”

“We’re already up 25%. Fuck-ing cheer-ing! Mate, open your eyes and smell the cheese. Nothing is what it seems. This reality has been entirely manufactured for us and it’s ripe for the picking. Now that the newspapers don’t care about the Royal Commission, it’s back to normal for us.”

A long pause began at that full stop, followed by two more big sips.

“Oi, do you want some cocaine? I bought it with my Tron,” he said to our reporter.

Local Man Applies Insect Repellent To Mozzie Bites In Pointless Attempt At Fixing Itch

TEXT:

A local Betootan has been spotted applying copious amounts of Aeroguard spray to his already heavily bitten arm, despite being warned by nan 30 minutes earlier that the “mozzies are here.”

Dave Saunders, 43, had been enjoying his Sunday Barbecue at his in-laws place without even thinking of the consequences of the location.

“They live behind a swamp, but I didn’t even think about it. I thought, I’ll be right. Obviously, I made the wrong choice.”

Saunders then made a further blunder in his choice of outfit for the evening, a Bintang singlet and shorts, with only thongs protecting his feet from the impending mosquito invasion.

“It’s totally fucked. It was the only clean thing I had. What was I supposed to do?”

He then was forced to spend the rest of the evening hopelessly covering his body in the one can of Aeroguard brought by nan, who proceeded to lecture him on the importance of preparation with the same stories she’d been telling for the last 30 years.

When the Betoota Advocate contacted her, she had this to say: “David is a good kid, but he can be a silly little boy sometimes. I sent him home with the rest of the can, just in case.”

Despite using over half a bottle, Saunders saw no improvement on the case of his bites.

In a statement, Aeroguard wrote, “Our products clearly say on the label, for use by those of the age 3+. Obviously we didn’t take into account complete dumb-fucks not applying beforehand.”

Report: Watching The ABC Every Monday Night Makes You Better, Smarter Than Everyone Else

TEXT:

Wanting to save the planet but refusing to release themselves to the rough sea of the local public transport system, a popular educated couple has curled up on their Matt Blatt sofa tonight – ready to tap into the zeitgeist.

As half a bottle of Côtes du Rhône sloshes around in their tum-tums, Jack and Francine Williams, of Betoota Grove put their 43-month-old down for the night just in time for the 7:30 Report.

“It’s actually just called 7:30 these days,” said Francine, correcting our reporter.

“Anyway, take your shoes off at the living room door please and be quiet. The show is about to begin.”

As Leigh Sales begins to rip into the latest hapless public servant, Jack’s eyes roll back in his head.

His 34-year-old bones writhe within his soft flesh while he bucks violently in sexual ecstasy against the faux leather sofa

“He likes it,” says Francie, smiling at our reporter.

At this point, our reporter is physically disturbed by what he’s seeing.

The slithering and tongue-talking comes to a close as the familiar, crass jingle of Australian Story snaps Jack out of his trace.

“Oh jeez,” he says softly.

“I really got lost in the moment there, didn’t I? [laughs] Anybody need a top up? Australian Story features too many athletes. ”

Thinking the worst was behind him, our reporter also laughed nervously and took up the offer of another glass.

But by the time Four Corners rolled around, Francine joined Jack in another dimension of self-satisfaction.

This time our reporter observed them both slip off the couch and onto the Berber carpet, where they repeatedly tensed their bodies sharply and relieved themselves multiple times on the rug.

They stayed there for the duration of the landmark investigative journalism programme until Paul Barry’s cultivated tongue brought them back to reality.

“Look, honey. They’re going after The Telegraph again,” said Jack.

Francine didn’t respond – she was bending all the way through until Q&A.

Mere seconds after Tony Jones, host of the panel show, uttered the name ‘Chris Bowen’ they both let out a guttural moan and went back writhing around on the carpet for an hour.

With every ‘gotcha moment’ and speechless panellist, another primaeval grunt emerged from the Williams’ living room.

Just as he thought he’d better let himself out, the couple returned back to reality seemingly unaware of their actions over the past 3 hours.

“Hmmmm,” said Jack.

“Not the best Monday night I’ve had watching the ABC but fun and informative. Still more fun than watching that shit on the commercial networks. Do you agree?”

Our reported nodded and said he agreed.

“You’ll have to come back next week. It’s book club.”

Elderly Neighbours Excitedly Watch On After Calling The Cops On House Party Down The Road

TEXT:

Saturday night, Betoota Heights.

Two ageing and respected members of the middle-class enclave atop the hill on the north side of town have taken offence to a gathering of young people down the road.

As the sun began to set, the first call was placed to Probationary Constable Blake Washbrook at the Wilcox Avenue Police Station.

“I thought it was weird,” he said.

“We don’t typically get calls until at least midnight. Never the less, the residents seemed pretty concerned, so we went up the hill for a look.”

Driving past slowly, they say no evidence of a party. Perhaps a dull thud and idle chatter wafting from 34 Redhen Street.

The paddywagon cruised by without stopping, in plain view of Beryl and Graham Pocks, who live down the road and opposite number 34.

“Then it was back the drawing board,” said Graham as he forcefully pushed a Scotch Finger on our reporter.

“It was simply too loud, we couldn’t hear anything. Heartbeat had just started and we couldn’t settle. Beryl came up with a plan.”

A second call was placed to the Wilcox Avenue police station at 10pm, where a disgruntled and afraid Beryl alleged that youths were ‘hooning up and down Redhen Road using obscene language and causing damage to personal property’.

Again, Probationary Constable Washbrook and his superior Seargent Barry Dore made the four-minute drive up the hill to make some arrests and beat some Millennials into the next ice age.

However, the police were disappointed to find nothing going on.

In a fit of furious anger, Graham spit and said ‘shit’ once before retiring to his single bed beside Beryl’s.

“Those bastards haven’t heard the last of me! In the morning, I’m going to ring their real estate agent, those renting peasants, and tell them that they’re dealing pot!”

Never the less, Graham never woke up on Sunday and the coroner declared him dead at age 79 sometime yesterday morning.

The cause of death is still under investigation.

Dream Catcher Above Local Millennial’s Bed Has Only Caught Broken Ones So Far

TEXT:

Aside from being permanently locked out of the housing market, persecuted for enjoying a popular stonefruit smooshed onto bread for breakfast and being forced to take out huge loans for his tertiary education, a local 25-year-old is remaining mildly positive.

Matt Dylan, of Betoota Grove, says he first hung a dream catcher above his bed because he thought it looked cool.

He regaled himself and anyone who’d listen in the mythology behind it and the concepts of its creation.

Interesting to say the least, he says.

However, as rosy as the Gemini’s outlook on life is, he told The Advocate today that he’s still waiting for the dream catcher to catch him some dreams that aren’t broken.

“There is no purpose in life,” he said, moments after showing us a meme through the shattered screen of his Mum’s old iPhone4 s.

“Everything I need or want is out of reach and it seems that the only thing I ever do in life is work and get pissed. I can’t even afford to buy drugs anymore because I’m too time poor to feel scat these days,”

“If there’s anybody reading this who is old as fuck, like I mean 35 or over, is this what life is like? Am I being punished for doing an Arts degree? I didn’t do three years of study to work in a cafe the rest of my life. Does it get better? Will my dream catcher catch me some dreams that have a remote chance of coming true?”

No, according to his father.

Peter Dylan explained to The Advocate that coupled with his son’s work ethic and mental capacity, none of his dreams will ever come true.

“What kind of red-blooded Australian man puts a dream catcher above his bed?” said Peter.

“Yeah, look. He’ll be OK. When I die, he and his brother can fight over this place after they put their mother in a home. That’s the only part that concerns me,”

“And another thing. Dreams aren’t caught, they’re built. You don’t get what you want in this world if you spend each Sunday curled up in bed crying listening to The Smiths, do you?”

Matt conceded his father was correct but said he was still probably going to retire to his room to listen to The Queens Is Dead on repeat until he falls asleep.

Small Town RSL Front Desk Asks Non-English Speaking Backpackers If They’re Members

TEXT:

An ordinary Thursday night shift has become anything but as North Betoota RSL club front-desker Stuart Atkins (65) asked a group of non-English speaking backpackers if they are already club members.

“Good evening guys. Member?”

The startled group of Melbourne-bound French backpackers stated they know enough English to get by, but were unable to recognise the term “member?” as a greeting.

“Sorry? I don’t understand…”

“Youse already members?”

“Member?”

Following this Atkins launched into a five-minute speel about the benefits of an annual club membership such as reduced food and drink prices as well as automatic entry into monthly mega-prize raffles.

“Raffles?”

Having only met three French people in his lifetime, it took Atkins some time to clue on to the idea that this group of people who were likely spending their first and last night in Betoota, would not be able to make the most of a year-long RSL membership.

Moving along, Atkins asked them to scan their ID’s to get their temporary membership ticket and permit them entry into the club.

Following the machine’s struggle to recognise a French driver’s license, Atkins double checked that they didn’t just want to save some time and become members anyway.

“Or you could sign up for five years and pay just $40?”

“We are from Biarritz.”

At a complete loss of what to do, Atkins signed the group of four in by filling in their information on the old visitor book system, nearly giving up at least twice during the process.

Speaking through a translator, traveller Marcel Aubergine (25) shared with us what she thought of his cultural experience at one of Australia’s many fine RSL’s.

“It was easier to get through quarantine at Darwin Airport than it was to get in here. There is a restaurant in Japan where you sit in your own cubicle and a pair of anonymous hands pass you your food through a curtain. That place has more of a focus on people than here.”

The healthy eating trend that has taken the world by storm has today trickled down into the community of Australia’s backbone, the tradie. Tradies across Australia have realised that their health is the one commodity that they have complete control over, so they’ve begun switching their meat pies and leftovers for the healthier option of a Coles roast chicken and coleslaw sanga.

Local carpenter Tom Scoles (28) is an early adopter of the trend, and as he explains, the initial reaction on his work site was anything but welcoming.

“Oh they looked at me like I was a fucking fruit loop,”

“Especially Shayden the brickie. His misso packed him a couple chops and potato bake, and he sat there taunting me with it.”

“At first I thought about chucking my sanga in the bin and walking directly to KFC, but the moment I bit into that succulent chicken, I knew I’d made the right decision.”

While Tom is experiencing some backlash about his healthy eating habits, according to multiple reports from other tradies at Tom’s work site, they too are considering making the switch.

“Oh yeah, look, I’ll probably give it a go. If it gets the misso [sic] off my back about putting on a few kg’s then I’ll do it,” considered one plasterer.

“I do love a fresh roast chook,” said another rather ambiguously so as not to commit to the new diet.

The Advocate understands that Tom has already lost 15kgs by simply switching to this healthier lunch option. We suspect that it’s only a matter of time before the wider trade community catches on.

New Homeowner Says Come Over For A Tour Of Their 800 Sq Ft Skybox

TEXT:

Managing to squeeze her way into the property market through a combination of hard work and wealthy parents, Janice Baillieu (28) insists you must have the tour of her 800 square foot Sydney apartment, despite the fact you saw most of it when you stepped inside.

“Come on in guys, you MUST have the tour. Shoes off first haha!”

A comprehensive tour of Baillieu’s North Sydney apartment takes approximately 90 seconds to complete, with highlights being the living room/kitchen space and multipurpose bathroom/laundry area.

“I also enjoyed the mini-bar/boardgame storage compartment. She said it will be lots of fun whenever she has a party.”

Reviews of the apartment tour have thus far been mixed, with many guests stating it was too short, unnecessary and uninspiring.

“We didn’t even really get to see the bedroom because she said it was too messy. I don’t know how it got like that, she’s only lived here a week. Bad tour, one star.”

Having lived in her apartment for three months, Baillieu still finds herself giving impromptu tours of her Hotwheels sized apartment to various friends, family members and even once an Uber Eats delivery man.

“I just dropped off a Poke Bowl and I could already see the whole apartment. I was worried the bag I delivered wouldn’t fit in the apartment. But I accepted the tour anyway because some pornos begin that way sometimes.”

Baillieu states she is aware her apartment is a bit on the small side but is coming up with a few ideas on how to spice up her tour while making the apartment appear bigger.

“Adding a mirror should do the trick.”

Barnaby Joyce Saga Inspires George Christensen To Get Back On The Horse

TEXT:

The Deputy Prime Minister walked into George Christensen’s parliamentary office this morning with one thing on his mind.

It wasn’t anything to do with Malcolm Turnbull, it wasn’t anything to do with his ongoing personal issues.

Barnaby Joyce spoke candidly to the Member For Dawson about giving love another chance.

As they exchanged pleasantries, Joyce took a boot and sock off to cover the smoke alarm on the ceiling.

“Isn’t it about time you got back on the horse, mate?” asked Joyce, sitting backwards on a swivel chair rolling and cigarette.

“You need to make hay while the sun shines, or cut cane. Whatever you guys do up there. Anyway, mate. I reckon you should get on Tinder, there are a few catches walking these halls. Just don’t swipe right on anybody you’ve got on staff,”

“Fucking top hat will burst a blood vessel if you do. Just keep everything outside off on a good length and you should be right. Ok mate, I’ve gotta run but you take in what I said, yeah?”

And with that, Joyce flicked his cigarette out Christensen’s first-floor window, ripped his sock off the smoke alarm and let himself out.

Let to ponder on the wise words of Australia’s most under-siege politician, Christensen paid a visit to the Google Play store to peruse some dating apps.

“There’s a cute Greens staffer that works in the red room,” he told The Advocate via Wickr.

“I used up my Super Like or whatever that means on her. All signs are positive so far. Boys, I’ve gotta get back to it.”

Date Swoons As Young Professional Refreshes His Crypto Wallet Right Before Her Eyes

“No, really,” she said.

“I’m listening this time. Explain the blockchain to me one more time.”

James Cartwright smiled and slide back in the booth and began to explain one more time, in layman’s terms, just how incredible the concept of blockchain really is.

The casual, nonchalant manner in which the 25-year-old commercial leasing agent would refresh his bloated cryptocurrency wallet in plain view of Marcia Wilma sent a bolt of lightning from her head, all the way down to her toes.

“Have I told you about my Neo?” said James, turning way to giggle shyly.

Marcia’s pupils dilated to the point where her eye colour no longer showed.

“No, please tell me about your Neo. Tell me all the dirty details about your Neo,” she said.

He leant in, she mirrored.

“I bought in at 30 cents.”

She threw her head back and gasped.

“You must be rich? It’s at like a lot more than that now, right?”

Putting his phone back in the inside pocket of his beige Tarocash sportscoat, James winked and smiled.

While he might seem wealthy on the screen, the reality is much different.

“Me and a few mates, my crypto mates, are trying to find a way to cash out of our Neo without having to pay capital gains tax. We’re trying to defraud the Australia Tax Office and the Australian tax payer. Why should get a slice of my Etherium pie?”

With that, Marcia’s mouth slowly opened as she soft exhaled.

“You never told me about Etherium? Wait! Refresh your portfolio, I want to see how much money you’ve made or lost over the past 10 minutes.”

The waiter came to the head of the table and asked if they’d like anything else.

“Do you take BitCoin?” said James.

“We take cash, credit or the manager will put you in a rear naked chokehold until a vein bursts in your frontal lobe. Most people play with card but it’s ultimately up to you,” said the waitress.

“Hmmm… how bullish,” replied James.

White Australian Panics And Overcomplicates Handshake With Cool Black Friend

TEXT:

Innocent bystanders were left in a state of shock today after witnessing a goofy migaloo mangling a pretty standard handshake with a black mate.

It is believed that Gareth Evans (27) was out treating himself to an early lunch of some super spicy chicken pad thai when he run into an acquaintance of a darker complexion. What happened next sent chills down the spine of everyone within the vicinity.

The black man in question, Jackson Peters (31), says while he’s experienced some pretty shocking examples whiteness before – nothing could have prepared him for how awkward his handshake with Gareth was today.

“Hey J-Daddy!” chirped Gareth.

“How you been my brother from another mother?”

Jackson, who was having a coffee with some work colleagues at the time, reluctantly met Gareth’s enthusiasm.

“Hey Gareth! Not too bad, mate. How are you?” he said.

As Gareth outstretched his open palm for a handshake, no one was more nervous than he was about what was going to happen next.

Like most dorky palagis, Gareth is under the impression that black people are keen to engage in a more intimidate style of greeting, like he sees in American TV shows like Empire and Power.

While he prepares himself for the possibility of a brotherly grip-lock with the option to bring-it-in, he also is wary that Jackson might just want to shake hands like people who don’t know each other that well shake hands.

As expected, he fucks it up.

By somehow getting both his thumb and index wrapped around Jackson’s entire five fingers, he awkwardly chuckles and tries to save face by shaking his arm and saying things like ‘oooh’ and ‘what’re we doing here haha’.

As the conversation between the two limps on, Gareth begins to blush a bright shade of crimson.

Jackson spoke to The Betoota Advocate about the exchange.

“It’s alright. I just think that he needs to relax a little”

“I don’t know why he puts so much pressure on himself. It’s just a simple greeting. We don’t even need to shake hands. We don’t know each other that well”

At time of press Jackson was seen exhaling heavily while ordering an extra large cappuccino with two sugars to take back back to the office.

Study: Running With A Back-To-Front Visor Can Increase Speeds By Up To 20%

TEXT:

According to a recent study conducted by Australia’s peak scientific body, running with a visor turned back-to-front on your head can actually make you run faster.

Researchers from the CSIRO have observed speed and pace increases by up to 20%.

That’s compared to folk running with either a baseball cap, Akubra or forward-facing visor, says Julia Coleman, who chaired the study.

“We think it might have something to do with aerodynamics or something,” she said.

“It’s actually faster to run with no hat. Even faster if you shave all your hair off. But everybody likes to run with some sort of headwear on so they were removed from the study as being outliers,”

“From what we’ve been able to establish, because a visor weighs less than a hat, you can run fast with it. Plus when it’s backwards on your melon, it creates less drag, making you even faster.”

The Advocate caught up with a popular local jogger, who’s been spotted sporting a sporty visor when he runs around Machattie Park down in Betoota Ponds.

Thomas Jung, who moonlights as a geologist at the Betoota Heights Uranium Enrichment Plant, explained to our reporters that he’s tried running in everything from an Akubra Sombrero to a paisley red bandanna.

“The bandanna was the worst one,” he said.

“People would drive past and leer out the window, ‘Run! Sinbad! Run!’ so I stopped wearing it. The Akubra wasn’t much better. One colleague called me ‘The Bushtucker Gronk’ which is quite mean,”

“So I started wearing a back-to-front vizor and now people just call me dudebro or Brad, even though that’s not my name. Maybe it should be my name?”

Inner-City Leftie Can’t Write Anything Without Smudging It

TEXT:

In his position as both the Southwest Queensland Young Monarchists League President and the local Young Nationals Treasurer, Sam Walton-Bruce does a lot of handwriting.

And has a leftie, smudges often follow everything he writes.

It’s one of life’s small inconveniences, according to the 24-year-old.

He took the time to speak to The Advocate on this hot Thursday afternoon about how being a leftie has impacted upon his short life.

“Doing exams is the worst,” he said.

“Even if you really try to keep your hand above or below the line, you still seem to smudge everything. But my two jobs I have now require me to do a lot of handwriting and the people who have to read it often complain about how illegible it is.”

When Sam was a schoolboy The Whooton School, an exclusive, prestigious and above all, leafy, private school in Betoota Grove, his teachers attempted to beat the leftie out of him.

On one occasion, he came to school on a fancy dress fundraising day dressed as Ned Flanders with the word, ‘Leftorium’, printed across the front of a jumper.

Staff allowed some of the other boarding students to beat him with gym shoes placed in a wash bag as punishment for being a leftie, what was reported by The Advocate at the time.

They ultimately failed to curb his left cursive leanings.

“I’ve been a proud Young National since I left the school,” he said.

“I’ve been and will continue to be a loyal subject to Queen Elizabeth II and may God permit her a long and healthy life.”

“I haven’t let being a massive leftie hold me back.”

Apprentice Finally Signed Off On 1st Year After Blowing Into Boss’s DUI Interlock At Knock Off

TEXT:

A construction worksite in Betoota’s growing Flight Path District is in good spirits this afternoon, as a local sheriff arrived to install a court-ordered breathalyser in their boss’s SS holden ute – where it will remain for a 14 months of probation.

The alien car modification marks the end of a lengthy web of legal tape that Neddy Kouris (56) has had to battle through since getting pinched driving home from the work Christmas party after 15 cans of Carlton Dry.

The in-car device is aimed at supporting serial drink driving offenders to ensure they can separate their alcohol intake from their commuting. The alcohol-interlock device is designed to prevent the participants vehicle from starting if alcohol is present on their breath.

“No good Ned” shout’s Neddy’s offsider, foreman Kel.

“How long’s this for?”

Neddy says just over year. Which should time well.

“My kids are just getting old enough to notice this kind of shit” he said.

“The wife will be happy she can stop explaining it to her girlfriends when I pick them up from a night out”

As the whole worksite pauses to observe the random government employee currently taking a screwdriver to Neddy’s dash, the crowd begins to murmur.

“Who’s Neddy’s designated blower this arvo?” shouts Ned, in third person, before catching the eye of the apprentice Rod.

“Roddy. Don’t have another beer ha ha ha”

“It is my dream, it is my nightmare,” said the 31-year-old.

The Advocate joined Lambeau in his plush French Quarter apartment which seemed a little bit too nice for a man of his profession.

“I work at the meat plant. I’m a packer. They let us wear headphones when we’re at our station. It’s not legal but he boss doesn’t care. He only cares about money,”

“Which means I can get up to whatever I want each day, just as long as I get the work done.”

His day begins before many of us even consider rising.

A 4am run until the sun meets the morning sky, followed by an intense gym session. All this before 7.

“I run along this goat track through the lantana in Frost Park. It’s full of snags and opportunity to get little cuts on my arms and legs,”

“Most mornings, my headphone cord gets snagged and the buds get ripped out of my ears. I’ve heard that really annoys other people.”

CARPE DIEM: Local Couple Trades Drugs And Alcohol For Rollerblading And Good Times

TEXT:

This time last year, most Sunday for Pierce Lewis and Emma Poncho were a struggle.

One of them would roll out of bed, feel the blood rush out of their brain as they made their way down to an Old City District cafe for caffeine and banana bread.

If times were especially bad, they’d come back with a pair of bacon & egg rolls.

But that was then, this is now.

The 26-year-olds have turned their backs on the drug and alcohol-fuelled weekends of yesteryear for a far more noble pursuit.

Rollerblading.

“It’s great fun,” said Peirce – who hasn’t seen any of his old friends for weeks.

“Can’t believe we used to spend all that money on drinks and uppers! Honestly, we’ve actually got savings now. Not sure what we’re saving for, it sure as shit isn’t a deposit. Perhaps some tickets to the Book of Mormon or something? [laughs] Everything is better now.”

Emma too was laughing as she echoed Pierce’s sentiments, explaining to The Advocate that she thought she’d have a hard time convincing him to give up the bag for a bit of Sunday cardio – but it was easy.

As she showed our reporter the bits and pieces they’d ordered online from IKEA, Pierce nodded along in agreement as he fidgeted with his hands and feet.

“We both haven’t had a drink in about a month,” said Emma.

“Our sleep has improved like crazy. We’re sleeping like private school kids after a huge day at Perisher. Plus we feel way better. Don’t we?”

Pierce nodded.

“Way better. My work has gotten better and everything. I don’t miss hanging out with the fellas on a hot Friday night. Don’t really miss jamming two or three hundred into Pelican Pete, throwing a few fish in his gullet. Don’t really miss a night escalating into a drug-fuelled haze that can only be brought to a close with a romper sucked through a Paul Newman salad dressing bottle.”

“I’ve got rollerblading now.”

City Worker Happy To Drop $400 On Dinner Tonight If It Means He Doesn’t Have To Watch Reality TV

A midtown young professional as spoken of how pleased he is to spend an evening away from the television tonight – even if it costs him half a week’s pay.

Francis Guy, a private asset manager at Funk & Partners on 2nd Avenue, said he’s preparing to drop ‘about $400’ on ‘a bit of shitty pasta and a bottle of wine older than him.’

“It’s a small price to pay,” he said.

“Most nights I get home, collapse on the couch and barely have enough time to take the Hush Puppies off before I hear the velvety voice of Manu or something,”

“God forbid Sal’s got that other celebrity show on, that jungle one. I’d rather have two completely unnecessary knee reconstructions at the same time than watch an episode of that. Anyway, it’s 5 so I’m out the door.”

Just as happy is partner Sally Porce, who took the initiative of booking the restaurant for tonight’s dinner.

Looking toward the French Quarter, the slightly younger professional made the booking back in October at the fabled Pleasure Chest Seafood Grill on Rue du Lapin.

“Francis said just book something, he didn’t give a shit. So I booked a nice place. We’re going to split the bill, it’s 2018 after all.”

“I’ve heard so many good things about the Pleasure Chest, I can’t wait for tonight.”

“Let Me Crack Your Back” Says Wildly Unqualified Chiropractor At Kick-Ons

Phil Pichot, a farrier by trade, says he was down at the Intellectuel Asexué Barre & Grille on Greenbow Road when the call was made to head back to a friend’s place with a few boxes of beer and a positive attitude.

As the evening rolled on, Brett Corcoran began cracking the backs of various party guests.

Then Brett turned to Phil.

“Brother,” he said sensually and strong.

“It is your turn. Let me crack your back.”

He paused for a moment, remember that this man has consumed a large amount of drugs and alcohol over the past 12 hours.

“Fuck it,” he said to himself.

Rising majestically from the IKEA Poang chair like a banknote caught in an updraft, Phil followed Brett’s instructions as he carefully wrapped his thick, python-like arms around the upper torso.

“Heerrrrrrg!”

A loud, muffled crack filled the living room. Drowning out the Gorillaz softly playing on the UE Boom for a split second.

Phil turned to jelly, a jolt ran down his back to his toes.

In a word, he was electric.

“How do you feel now?” he asked.

Over a few casual beers this afternoon, Vietnamese mate Martin Vo has accidentally revealed that he used to spend most Thursday’s nights in the CostCo car park with his cousins from Betoota’s light industrial district, underneath the flight path.

After a conversation about the latest Fast and the Furious movie turned into a debate, Martin revealed his dark closest involvement in the underground street racing subculture while arguing about how unrealistic the entire movie franchise his.

“Mate, fast cars don’t look like they do in the movies” he said.

“It’s usually the sleepers* that you wanna watch out for. If you’re racing that is. No one is just going to show off how fast their car is by leaving their fucking bonnet open”

As the entire circle turns their attention to Martin, he quickly realises he’s said too much.

“I mean, from what I’ve heard..”

After being forced to explain just what the fuck a ‘sleeper’ is, Martin is now treading water as his non-Vietnamese mates begin probing into just what else he knows.

“Look I’ve only gone down to the Midnight Club a few times” he says.

The rest of Martin’s afternoon is spent avoiding his mates requests to take them down their some time.

*  a SLEEPER  is a car that has high performance and an unassuming exterior. Sleeper cars are so called because their exterior looks similar or identical to a standard or economy-class car. In some cases the car appears worse due to seeming neglect on the owner’s part.

Tamworth Red Rooster Removes The ‘S’ From Their Sign In Solidarity With Barnaby Joyce

Popular Tamworth highway diner, Red Rooster, has become Red Rooter overnight in solidarity with their embattled local member Barnaby Joyce.

The restaurant’s manager had the brainwave yesterday afternoon and went about removing the ‘S’ from their sign after close.

“I just thought it’d be nice to show him and The Nationals some support,” said manager Randy Bore.

“Also, the community is going through a tough time after the by-election. It’s a tough time for everybody involved.”

Randy says the joke shouldn’t really have to be explained, but for anyone who isn’t on his level when it comes to wit – the ‘red rooter’ is in reference to his adulterous local members iconic RSL tan.

“But yeah, back to the sign. I’d seen it done by vandals before. We’ve actually had the ‘S’ ripped off our roof many times before,”

“But this time, I thought I’d be proactive. Drum up a bit of press for the business. Looks like it’s worked, hey? I’m speaking to you guys now. I might even end up on the Today Show at this rate, have a bit of banter with Karl. That’d be grouse.”

When asked if he first consulted the owner or franchisee about the plan, Randy said he had not – but says all the attention the place is getting is sure to please them.

The publicity stunt comes the same morning more allegations against the red-faced Deputy Prime Minister surfaced in various News Corp publications around the country.

Local Battler Takes To Social Media To See If Anybody Has An Old Phone He Can Have

TEXT:

For the second time this year, Greg Pouch of Betoota Heights is currently without a phone.

Just how the 28-year-old came to lose his phone is a mystery even to him – let alone those who are lucky enough to call him a close friend.

Rather than trudge it out until the end of his current phone plan, which is due to expire in October 2019, Greg has taken an entrepreneurial leaf out of a self-help book he’s reading now and taken to social media to see if any of his internet friends have an old phone he can just have.

“Phone = dead,” wrote the marginally successful buyer’s agent on The Face Book.

“Does anybody have an old phone I can have? An iPhone 6 or above would be ideal.”

He didn’t even say thank you, according to a former classmate of Greg’s.

Though Michael Rust has been following Greg’s ill-fated odyssey through life since leaving school a decade ago, he’s going to stop short of offering him the use of a perfectly-usable iPhone 7 in his top drawer.

“It’ll only end up lost,” he said.

“There’s also a lot of personal information on someone’s phone. If you hand out your old phones to people, you’ve got rocks inside your fucking head where your brain should be.”

Our reporter asked Greg who he needed such a flash phone, why he couldn’t just put up with having a $29 burner until he could afford something nicer, he said that he uses ‘apps’ for work and an older phone just wouldn’t make muster.

“I need a phone you can email off and have Instagram on,” he said.

“It’s 2018 and a smartphone, one like an iPhone 6 or better is a basic human right. What am I? A farmer?”

New Englander Pulling A Calf Says The Prospect Of Another By-Election Is Just As Disgusting

Peter Mulligon, a Glenn Innes man-of-the-land, has expressed his outrage and disgust to The Advocate this morning at the prospect of having to go back to the polls shortly for another by-election.

Though the 51-year-old says he’d vote for the Nationals candidate again, he drew the line at endorsing the Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce.

“Mate, he has to go. Just look at all the prolapse. This is a prettier sight than going back to the polls,” he said.

“This is some good old-fashioned Sir Joh-style corruption. Barnaby’s even spoken of how much he idolised the big Dane from Brisbane. You just have to look at the facts. Anybody would come to the same conclusion. He has to go,”

“And on top of that, the Prime Minister has been implicated in this whole mess as well. Just you wait and see, these blokes will handball the job to Bill Shorten before the next Easter. This entire mess is disgusting.”

When asked about who should foot the bill for the unavoidable New England by-election this winter, Mr Mulligon said the bloke who’s putting Barnaby up in Tamworth should – seeing as though he’s got money to burn.

The Advocate reached out to some other employees at the Glen Innes diary and what our reporter uncovered was nothing short of chilling.

Friend Attempts To Explain How We’re All Living In A Simulation Without Sounding Crazy

TEXT:

Moments after two men dressed in the same clothes walking out from the smoking pokies, Dale Tuckham thought it was about time he let his two friends in on a little secret.

“We’re living in a simulation, you know?” he said.

“A what?” said Annie Brown, who followed Dale and his roommate Tom down to their corner gastropub for dinner this evening.

“Just like in The Matrix, just like that. Didn’t you just see those two guys dressed the same come out of the pokies? That was a glitch in our simulation. Have you heard of the Mandela Effect? It’s kinda like what I’m saying now, but different,”

“Seriously. Think about it.”

Annie and Tom were thinking about it.

They weren’t thinking about how Dale could be right and that society is an alien construct, an experiment conducted by some all-powerful alien face – they were thinking about Dale’s deteriorating grip on reality.

Annie concedes that while Dale was being quite articulate in his argument, she’s ultimately unconvinced.

“I think I speak for Tom and I when I say that Dale is losing his mind,” she said.

“It’s not just this whole thing to do with the simulation, this is just a long line of things he’s said that makes people wonder if he’s crazy or not. I can’t believe he thinks Nelson Mandela died in prison?”

“Then who was President of South Africa? Kofi Anan? He was President of the Earth.”

Tom declined to comment on the matter, saying only that he hopes the simulation ends because there hasn’t been a good trend in memes for months.

Amy then told The Advocate that her friend Marcia and her on-and-off-again husband, Glenn, had recently had a baby and were trying to get people to hold it.

While many obliged the new parents and spent a few minutes with little Shoehorn, Amy was one of the few who politely declined the experience.

“I’m not ready, mentally, to hold a child,” she said.

“And I know why they’re doing it. If you’re sick of holding the kid, leave it out the front of a fire station and run away into the night. Plus, they named their first son ‘Shoehorn’ – as in the thing old people need to get in and out of their church shoes,”

But as there’s a smorgasbord of other more interesting events on, audiences began asking why they weren’t being shown.

“We didn’t buy the rights,” said a Seven spokesperson.

“We’d love to be able to broadcast the luge, that shit is cash. But the reality of broadcast rights and sponsor agreements and whatnot is that we can’t show these events,”

“If we did buy all the rights and had it all covered, we’d be broker than Channel 10. If you really want to watch the other events, you can always get a VPN and watch them online via America or New Zealand. That’s if your interest will hold up to a stream.”

The Seven spokesperson also revealed that they only had the budget to choose one event and that they’d already paid Steven Bradbury to commentate.

“Steven told us he didn’t know any other sports well enough to commentate on them,” they said.

“So we had a meeting with Kerry [Stokes] who said he didn’t care what we did so we just bought the rights to the speed skating. I’ll tell you what, Kerry sure as shit cares now,”

“He said we better show his favourite event, the ski jumping, or else he’ll stop paying for David Koch’s Muay Thai lessons.”

Regional Man Visiting Home Says He’s Missed The Budget Ads On Local TV

TEXT:

A Brisbane-based accountant arrived home in Betoota Heights this morning after an arduous two-day journey.

The first thing he did after putting his bags down was to put his feet up.

Everything was going great. The cricket was on, Dad was sitting shirtless out the back reading The Australian. Mum had just put some party pies in the oven.

For Mark Douglas, this is heaven.

The 28-year-old had missed all these small things in life he took for granted – but there’s one thing about home that he didn’t even know he missed.

Between the overs, when the viewer is spared Kevin Pietersen’s commentary for 60 seconds, a small smorgasbord of local businesses air their television commercials.

“Man, these are so bad they’re actually good,” he said, watching an ad for the North Betoota RSL Resort.

“It’s got all the hallmarks of a great country ad. A walking bass line, a celebrity endorsement, Comic Sans, Microsoft Movie Maker transitions,”

“They’re not going to win any Cannes Lions. Maybe a Cairns Lion but the person who’s responsible for this 20-second car crash shouldn’t get their hopes up.”

Just when he thought things couldn’t get any better, he opened the fridge and saw an unopened bottle of Fanta staring back at him.

“Score,” he said softly to himself.

Another over passed and in walked Mum with the party pies.

Pungent Smell Of Longbeach Originals Successfully Masked By Lynx Africa

TEXT:

Smokers across the nation are today rejoicing at the ground-breaking results of a decade-long study into how best to mask the smell left behind after smoking a cigarette. The study, carried out by Australia’s lead scientific body, CSIRO, indicates that spraying Lynx deodorant 2cm-8cm away from your index and middle fingers will completely remove all odour.

“This is a truly momentous day. We have long speculated that a strong scent would do the job, however, it was only recently that we discovered the fragrant holy grail, that is, Lynx” lead researcher, Benjamin Hedges, PhD, excitedly told our reporter.

“While all Lynx branded deodorants will work, our research shows that one spray of Africa will completely remove every other scent from the air”

“Take me, right now, for example, can you tell I had a cigarette just minutes before our interview? I bet you can’t”

Benjamin was correct, our reporter had absolutely no idea he was interviewing a smoker.

The Advocate reached out to a number of smokers in Betoota to see how they are already benefitting from the results.

“It’s grouse. I walk straight past mum and she has no idea me n Sharyd [sic] have just been punchin’ darts” one 13-year-old boy excitedly shares.

“I wish I knew this when I was at boarding school, I was always caught smoking by Ms Lindsey.” One Betoota Heights woman told our reporter.

Hiding the smell of cigarettes has been a conundrum that’s plagued the human race since the 15th century when the Europeans invaded the Americas and discovered tobacco.

At The Advocate, we are just feeling extremely blessed to be alive during this exciting time.

Middle-Class Stoner Moves Onto Hitchens After Lengthy Bill Hicks Phase

TEXT:

Change is in their air in South Betoota as basement dweller Marty “Muzza” Willis (19) finally discovers Christopher Hitchens after an intense ten-month long, bong-fueled Bill Hicks phase.

“He was one of the last good ones you know what I mean?” he said.

“Things…aaaah…people listened you know?”

After ploughing through all the Bill Hicks related material on YouTube, Willis decided to roll the dice and clicked on a suggested video he had not yet seen named “Christopher Hitchens OWNS idiot!”

Willis claims to watch this 480p video at 2:48 am was a life-changing experience that he insists would have been just as amazing if he was not twelve cones deep.

“Far out! So real!”

While friends of Willis are glad they will no longer be subjected to poorly performed Bill Hicks routines, they are not particularly enthused by the idea of Muzza regurgitating Hitchens’s anti-totalitarian regime through mouthfuls of half-chewed Cheese Supreme Doritos.

“Hitchens is the man! He knows more about religion than Christians! Genius!”

Despite being raised by non-religious parents, the dual influence of Hicks and Hitchens has turned Willis into what he describes as a ‘proud and militant atheist’ and what his mates describe as ‘a pretty basic stoner.’

Perhaps most responsible for Willis’s decline into nihilism his best friend, Patrick Mason (19), who was the one who introduced him to Bill Hicks in the first place.

“Yeah but, I showed him the funny one where he was having a go at the waffle waitress, not that atheist shit. Good God, what am I going to do when he discovers Richard Dawkins?”

Man Relives Childhood By Shotting Entire Packet Of Nerds Like It’s Tequila

TEXT:

Nipping in to buy some rolling papers at the Clarence Road Milk Bar, a packet of Nerds caught Michael Bust’s eye.

The 26-year-old had so much as thought about the delicious candy for close to 15 years.

All he knew now is that he wanted some.

“These a well, mate,” he said to the cashier, handing over his keycard for the $3.45 transaction.

Once on his walk back through Machattie Park to his parent’s leafy six-bedder in Betoota Grove West, Bust flicked his half-lit rolled cigarette into the duck pond and retrieved the Nerds from his pocket.

At first, he was frugal and pensive with his portions.

He told our reporters that sense of self-control quickly departed from his mind.

“Before I even knew it, I had the opening of the box pressed up against my mouth and I was going for it,” he said.

“I inhaled one side of the box in like 10 seconds. You wouldn’t see that type of gluttony on a John Candy room service bill. Honestly,”

“And guess what, after I was done chewing through that lot of crystalised sugar, I ripped the other side open and even poked my little tongue in the hole to govern the flow of candy. It was like the Tardis came down and transported me back to 1999.”

For the rest of the short walk home, Mike was spitting a sugary, colourful slurry onto the pathway every 15 to 20 steps – to the absolute horror and disgust of those who saw him.

When asked by our reporter if he’d do it again, he said maybe when he finds a job.

High School Bad Boy Forced To Now Live Life As Gay Man After Getting Wrong Ear Pierced

TEXT:

A local bad ass teenager who’s disengaged parents don’t mind him rocking a diamante ear ring has today discovered that he is gay, after getting his right ear pierced accidentally.

Lyndall Bowley (16) was quick to learn that he is now a gay man – after he arrived at school with the ‘gay ear” pierced.

It is not yet known if Lyndall was always gay or if he experienced an immediate gayformation while he was in the tattoo parlour yesterday – but one thing that is for sure, according to his mates, is that he doesn’t like girls anymore.

The concept of the ‘gay ear’ became heavily prominent in suburban America and Australia in the 1980s. While gay people do often have pierced ears, the concept of identifying yourself as a homosexual through piercings is believed to be mostly straight male paranoia rather than anything arising out of the actual LGBTI community.

However, in the school yard today at South Betoota High, this theory is as good as gospel.

While this news has changed a lot of things for the former heterosexual pretty boy who had actually previously enjoyed pashing chicks, he says he is lucky that in 2018 the idea of homosexuality is no longer something kids can be picked on over.

While Lyndall doesn’t yet know any of the cultural nuances of gay life as a teenager, he says he looks to forward to having a lot more female friends.

“I mean, I could just pierce the other ear and go back to being straight” he says.

“Or take it out and let it heal over. But everyone was so convincing in telling me that I am now gay due to the fact that I have accidentally gotten the wrong ear pierced”

“I’m gay now I guess”

Jesus Christ: Local Restaurant Has A Website That Actually Fucking Works

TEXT:

A French Quarter young professional has had his socks blown off this afternoon after he navigated to the website for a popular local restaurant and it was vaguely functional.

Dan Witman, a man who does things in an office with a computer in return for money, told our reporters he was expecting a maze of outdated menus, clunky design and an all-round negative user experience.

He was very, very wrong.

“Yeah, it was great,” he said.

“I was able to make a booking, browse the menu and take a look at the wine list. They even had nice, up-to-date pictures of the joint so I could tell them which table I’d like to book for Friday,”

“You see, we’re having a long lunch and these types of things are very important. One can only hope every local eatery follows this example.”

The Santorini Bar & Grill had their website professionally made by the owner’s nephew, according to a manager our reporter spoke to this afternoon at the resturant.

He was also under the impression that every restaurant had a functional website.

“You mean I’m the only one in town that has a working website?” said owner Constantine Georgiou.

“That means I’m wasting my money. I haven’t even seen our website, my brother’s kid in Brisbane made it for us.”

Mr Georgiou then brought the website up on the office computer.

“Jesus Christ!”

“I didn’t approve any of this. A Greek restaurant’s website should be needlessly complicated. Like having a video background or even some music. The menu should be hard to find, the booking system should not even work!”

“Why can’t people just ring a restaurant and speak to a person to book a table?”

Local University Now Offering Millennials The Ability To Rent A Degree

TEXT:

In a controversial move, the board at Royal South Betoota Polytechnic will allow prospective students to rent their degrees from June this year.

Rather than accrue a lifelong HECS/HELP debt, school leavers and mature-age students alike can complete the study required by each course, then simply pay a small fee each week until they retire or no longer require a degree.

One young local says she plans to take up the offer.

Lucy Roper, of Betoota Grove, says she plans to study law next semester after spending this one saving up from a trip around Europe.

“It just makes sense,” she said.

“Rather than have the burden of this HECS debt following me around for the rest of my life, I can just do like four-years of study then pay like $100 a week thereafter. Then we I retire or want to start a family, I can just stop paying,”

“Plus, I don’t have to start paying it off until I get a job as a clerk or something. There’s only like a small deposit to secure your spot and that’s it. I’d be able to afford it by then!”

It’s a similar model to a proposed model put forward by Woolworths South Betoota, which has begun renting avocados to millennials. When the rental term is up, the avocados can be returned as faeces as long as they’re in a clear plastic sleeve.

The amount of weight the avocado has lost while in the digestive system of the young person is calculated and deducted from the security deposit.

Small Town Custody Battle Theatrically Plays Out In Series Of Passionate Facebook Posts

TEXT:

Over the last several months it appears that Betoota Ponds local, Shawn Thomas (26), has relayed his ongoing custody battle to the world, using the social media platform known as Facebook.

In the most recent string of posts, Shawn takes aim at not only his ex Hayleigh, but also her two-faced friends and the new putrid dog that’s living with her now at her parent’s place.

“Doin my head in! People talking shit about me as a father and I’m the only one paying for shit! Kyal reckons Sharny calling this new bloke daddy too. Like your freinds are good influeneces. Just wanna see my kids” writes his most recent status, which has been liked by all the boys and a couple of relatives.

Not only is this putrid dog that Hayleigh has been seeing unemployed, but he also has a bad track record of fucking people over and Shawn is quick to point out that his cousin Ryleigh use to hang around that crowd and even knows that this bloke is no good.

“Exposeing my kids to that kind of shit !” writes Shawn, alluding to possible drug use or problem drinking.

“I’m no saint by no means but at least I don’t bring that stuff home!”

While experts say this kind of social media oversharing is never going to help someone’s case in the family courts, Shawn says it’s really been helping him ‘get a few things of his chest’

Elon Musk Checks Washing For Missing Wallet Before Realising It Was In His Car

TEXT:

Elon Musk has accidentally shot his wallet into space, according to a SpaceX spokesman.

The South African-born founder reportedly spent hours this morning looking for his wallet before realising it was in the centre console of his Telsa Roadster, which is now in outer space.

The SpaceX Falcon Heavy successfully launched from Kennedy Space Center in Florida today, carrying Mr Musk’s personal Tesla with it.

“Fuck!” said Musk in his California laundry.

“That’s where it is! Jesus wept!”

Even though his credit cards and other valuable loyal cards are currently thousands of kilometres from the nearest person, Elon’s first instinct was to check his internet banking to see if they’d been stolen.

“I knew I was in the clear when there weren’t any $90 transactions at 7/11 at four in the morning and there wasn’t any fast food on it,” he said.

“But still, even for a person like me, losing a wallet is a pain in the arse. More painful than watching the Springboks lose to Japan in the rugby last world cup.”

However, when asked by our reporter why it took so long for him to notice he was gone, Musk said doesn’t really have to use it that much.

The car, now on it’s way to Mars, was placed inside the rocket’s payload bay in January – meaning Musk has been without his wallet for a number of weeks.

“When you get to this level of wealth,” he said.

“Carrying things like a phone, wallet, keys or a laptop become unnecessary. People appear when you need things. That wallet had my Subway card in it, my driver’s license. I think it even had my old Blockbuster member card in it,”

“Irreplaceable things.”

Barnaby Joyce Heeds His Own Advice And Moves Young Family To Regional Town

TEXT:

Last year, the deputy prime minister suggested that if young people want to enter the property market, they need to start looking toward the bush and away from the big capitals.

Today, Barnaby Joyce has decided to lead by example.

The 50-year-old has made the decision to move his new, impending young family to Tamworth, a bustling inland metropolis with no less than three McDonald’s restaurants.

With the aid of his like-minded and helpful college, Bob Katter, the under-siege politician has already begun packing up his Canberra bachelor pad.

“Bob was the only once nice enough to return my calls this morning,” he said.

“To be honest with you, I’m not sure if he’s even read the news today. I think he just likes helping people when they ask for help. Anyway, as fate would have it, the advice I gave to all those bleeding hearts and their ironic tattoos locked out of the Sydney property market is the same advice that I’m taking now.”

Equally as enthusiastic about the move was Mr Katter, who told our reporters that he’s ‘pretty much’ the only other parliamentarian willing to lend some elbow grease to a coworker in need.

“It’s good to see a young bloke having a punt on himself. Not too many pollies stand by their word, glad to see young Barnaby stick to his constitution,” said Mr Katter.

“Barnaby rang my office this morning and asked if I could give him a hand with something and here I am. Half an hour later, my media advisor dropped me off with a cut lunch and a chocolate milk. She said she’d be back at 3 o’clock to pick me up,”

“That being said, we’ve got a lot of stuff left to pack and there’s only two of us. Either put the recorder down and lend a hand or go.”

Our reporter elected to go.

Latest Star Wars Movie Has Man Rethinking His Poor Opinion Of Jar Jar Binks

TEXT:

Sitting through another 100-minute sci-fi trainwreck last night, Sam Gregory sighed and felt underwhelmed by the lastest Cloverfield film – the latest in a long line of similar flicks to do so.

The 40-year-old was born the same year France executed their last person with a guillotine and the same year the first Star Wars film was released.

“It’s safe to say I’ve been a lifelong fan of the franchise,” said the harmless Sagittarius.

“Which is why it pains me to see it take such a turn.”

Since George Lucas sold the rights to the epic space opera media franchise company to Disney in 2012 for USD$4.06 billion, Sam said he’s noticed a significant drop off in quality of both storyline and character development – which has mystified, angered and confused him.

“It’s not like Lucas was even good at that in the first place,” he said.

“But these new Disney ones, these cash grab movies are making me look back on the prequels fondly,”

“Where at the time, I thought they were worth burning down half of Burbank for.”

From the podracing scenes to the casually racist characters, many parts of Episode One are now bedmates with nostalgia in Gregory’s mind, something he never thought possible.

“There would’ve been a time in my life when if you asked me to get two unnecessary knee reconstructions or sit through Episode One, I would’ve taken the surgery,”

“Episode Two was worse. It was nice to see that dude from Once Were Warriors again but it wasn’t enough to save that car crash,”

“But yeah. Now I don’t even care anymore. Worst thing is that they’ll just keep coming year after year.”

Tuesday Comedown For Local Finance Worker Has Dual Meaning Today

A local trader has spoken of the horror this morning that has befallen him personally, professionally and financially.

Had he been working diligently last week, with his ear to the ground, he would’ve been somewhat prepared. But today, Miles Pichot was caught unawares and a typically easy day at work has now turned into one from hell.

From the moment he sat down in his cubical at J.R. & Partners, a boutique yet bespoke private asset management firm in the town’s Old City District, he’s been fielding phone calls from clients concerned about their wealth.

It wouldn’t be that bad normally for the 26-year-old, there’s been plenty of falls and tumbles before – but this Tuesday is especially difficult as the portfolio manager did a small smorgasbord of illicit drugs over the weekend and now he is going through the withdrawals.

In between reassuring ageing white men that their nest egg is still safe, he spoke to our reporter about the perils of the AM hours today.

“Yeah, but nah. I’f be buying today if I didn’t blow all my money on the weekend,” he said.

“Markets go up and down all the time, whatever. But yeah, had a big weekend and I really don’t feel up to it all today. These blokes ringing up are all worried about their portfolios going down 5%. I wish was that was all I had to worry about,”

“Everything will be fine. Sometimes you just have to let some blood. Like if it was 1534 and you had the flu. Just let the blood out.”

Canadian Smashes Stereotypes By Planning To Be A Lift Operator In Perisher This Season

A worldly British Columbian has broken the mould this afternoon by confirming her intention to winter in Australia this year.

Luella Greenfish, a Nelson BC-native,  has taken a job at Perisher operating lifts this season and she told The Advocate via Skype today that she can’t wait to get Down Under and see what all the fuss is about.

“Yeah, usually it’s the other way around,” said the 24-year-old.

“You can’t seem to get on a lift in British Columbia without hearing an Australian accent. It should be a great change. I’ve only ever skied in powder, I think mastering that black-ice type snow in Australia will be a challenge and a half.”

When asked what prompted her to look for ski jobs in the Snowy, home to arguably the best snow in Australia, the Gemini explained that she simply wanted to ‘smash stereotypes’ and do something out of her comfort zone.

“I want to work in skiing and ski resort management eventually so I’m considering this adventure an educational experience,” she said.

“They’ve got different lifts in the northern hemisphere and all the Aussie lifties say that if you can ski at Perisher or Thredbo, you can ski anyway,”

“They also said the weed down there is pretty bad and everything is super expensive. I don’t know, I guess I’ll see if there’s any truth to the rumours when I arrive.”

Local Bar’s Unbeatable SuperBowl Drink Specials Somehow Fail To Lure People In At 9am On A Monday

Life’s Eternal Question Answered As Straight Man Gets Hit On In Gay Club

According to Young, as the night digressed he and his friends visited infamous Betoota Valley niteclub, The Miner’s Shaft (est. 1891), for last drinks. It was at the bar where a man approached the significantly sloshed Young and asked if he could buy him a drink.

“That’s right, he was like ‘Can I buy you a drink?’ Haha, it was SO funny! Is this how chicks feel?”

Completely flattered and pleasantly surprised the night took this turn, Young enjoyed being the subject of a sexual advance he would never reciprocate, for the short amount of time it lasted.

“He figured out I wasn’t gay when I asked if I wanted a drink and I asked for fire engine. I was panicking about what drinks they serve in these places’”

Despite having a drunken argument with one of his closest friends, seeing his ex with a new boyfriend and having his card declined in a taxi he soiled, Young maintains last night was the best of his life.

“I’m hot to gay guys! A gay guy hit on me last night. I’m hot!” he says.

Homeowner On Outskirts Of Town Has A Plan For Those Cars

Betoota Lakes man, Baydon Manning (57) has today defended himself, again, against claims that his car ever-growing collection is an eyesore. The collection, which is made up of over 100 unregistered cars in varying stages of rust and decay, is the first sight residents and tourists see when they drive into Betoota – and unfortunately for Baydon, the local council want it gone.

“Over my dead body, them cars are on my property and I can do whatever I want on my property,” exclaimed Baydon.

Baydon, a qualified mechanic, lives on a five-acre block on Betoota’s city limits and insists that he has a plan for each and every one of his cars.

“Mate, see that? That’s a 1969 Holden HT, gonna get the four-speed transmission outta that and put it in that there Monaro,” Baydon enthusiastically told our reporter.

“Fuck, then she’ll sing,”

When questioned on a time frame for his proposed restorations, Baydon became less animated and even less convincing in his response.

“Oh, you know, soon. Just gotta get a few things lined up first.”

The Advocate understands that Baydon has been saying ‘soon’ for the past 15 years, a phrase that incumbent Lord Mayor, Keith Carton, is sick and tired of hearing.

“The shire council has been too soft for too long,” said Carton.

“Should I be elected for a seventh term, I would make it illegal to hoard motor vehicles and let them dilapidate in plain view,”

“Not that it affects my life in the slightest, I just enjoy being mayor and having the power to make arbitrary rules and laws that people have to follow.”

“What is it?! Why are you shouting?!” yelled his father, Werner.

“Don’t worry! Get your own fucking breakfast this morning!” she replied.

“What’s gotten into you, Ingrid?”

She left the kitchen without replying.

While he rode the bus to work into the Old City District this morning, a still bemused Rolf decided to check up on his mother via SMS to see if she was OK.

Rolf had his mind put at ease a short time later, to the point where he felt comfortable enough to speak candidly to one of our reporters about the experience.

“Turns out it had something to do with the moon or something,” he said.

“You see, Mum’s a Scorpio. That makes her emotionally unstable just to begin with. There are some days when she can’t even reverse park without calling something or someone a ‘cunt’ – but we all have those days, don’t we?”

“Anyway, she knew she woke up differently this morning and knew her behaviour was quite erratic so she did what every middle-aged mother does in this situation – she read her horoscope.”

In The Advocate today, the horoscope for the Scorpio sign was as follows:

Don’t let the impending change in the seasons define you. You’re nearing your goals and don’t need any distraction. Purple monkey dishwasher. There’s going to be challenges this month that you’re not prepared for but don’t let them get you down. Adapt and overcome. Perhaps your daughter might come back from the big smoke with the idea that Australia Day should be changed to the day John Howard dies? Maybe she’s pashed a hot Catholic boy and is afraid to tell you? Don’t take it personally, let your love shine through. If you get angry at the smallest thing, you’ll let it out and feel much better for it. Ride my Scorpio, ride.

The Advocate reached out to other members of the Skovgaard for comment but have yet to receive a reply.

Student Inspired To Become A Journalist After #Metoo Stuck Writing MAFS Recaps

TEXT:

There was a time when Fiona Sears thought journalism could change the world.

That time is passed.

Spending close to two years learning how to write, ask and interpret left the 21-year-old feeling weary and burned out – but with a diploma in her hand and a mortarboard photograph for Mum, Dad and Grandma Joh, her hopes in reporting the facts rekindled.

Four days after her third round interview with the French Quarter’s Pisse Monde, a local French-language subsidiary of The Advocate, the happy-go-lucky Virgo got the nod and everything in the world seemed right again, she said.

“I was inspired to become a journalist after watching brave women make the brave and right decision to say enough was enough and wicked men need to be held accountable for their actions,” she said.

“Leaving school, I thought about doing something like law or finance, or both. I could’ve just buried my head in the sand and driven a Porche Cayman. But I thought fuck it, I’ll be a reporter. And for a while, I loved it.”

That was, until earlier this week, when her boss wrote her death warrant.

“He came in and basically thought, ‘Oh, I bet Fi likes that fucking Married at First Sign of Mental Illness show. People read that shit and we need clicks so I’ll get the youngest woman in the newsroom to write recaps every fucking day because it’ll keep her busy,’ and here I am,”

“I pitched him a story this morning about the Mayor using his power to rezone semi-rural land his wife owns so it can be subdivided into quarter-acre home and land packages and he just laughed at me then said Pierre was already covering it and I shouldn’t worry – but to send Pierre all the research I’d done.”

“Like fuck I’m doing that.”

The Advocate phoned Robert Cadieux, the editor of Pisse Monde, for comment earlier this morning and he was able to explain why the things.

While he conceded that perhaps Ms Sears has a functioning brain and might not enjoy watching reality television, he said like all other newspapers, he needs to cater for an audience.

“If I could, I would have all my staff writing hard-hitting journalism, I really would,” he said.

“But the overwhelming majority of my readership doesn’t care about that kind of stuff. Advertisers don’t call us up asking to do sponsored content based around the Arab Spring or #metoo. Audiences these like having their opinions about certain people on reality television programmes reaffirmed by a reputable source of news,”

“It’s sad, I know, but life is a sea of pain and disappointment and then you die,”

“Now excuse me, I’ve just received word that one of those shotgun marriages has ended.”

Lifelong Public Servant Uses Taxpayer-Funded Pension To Sue Taxpayer-Funded Broadcaster

TEXT:

The net result to the taxpayer should be nil, according to Kevin Rudd.

Taking offence to an article published by the ABC, the former prime minister this morning announced his intention to sue the public broadcaster for public money, using public money given to him.

“They said I lied and that’s not correct,” said Rudd.

“The one who lied is Peter Garrett, he should change the words of his fucking song to, ‘how can we sleep while my pink bats are electrocuting underqualified Millennials in South Brisbane?’ or something like that,”

“Honestly, I had no idea. I like the ABC more when they made the video of my playing handball with those children go viral. Or when they leaked a video of me swearing.”

But that’s not correct, says an ABC spokesperson.

The Cabinet File discovery suggests that Mr Rudd did know that the now infamous ‘Pink Bat’ scheme was ‘quite dangerous’ and that it was exploited heavily by the very same criminal gangs former Queensland Premier Campbell Newman tried to disband.

“There are no real winners here,” said that ABC person.

“We’re all in the same boat here. Most of the ABC are lifelong public servants who’ve never really been exposed to the dangers of a career dictated by clicks, display advertising and a free market economy. Just like Kevin Rudd,”

“No matter who wins, there shouldn’t be any impact upon the taxpayer. The only people who stand to win here are Kevin Rudd’s legal team – and that money will no doubt go to a ski resort or a BMW dealership.”

Traveller Born When Communism Was Still A Thing Plans To Say He 24 On Upcoming Contiki

TEXT:

Austalia’s own Frank Abignale Jnr is currently galavanting around the European continent on a Contiki tour masquerading as a 24-year-old university student – when in reality, his a 36-year-old Betoota Heights web designer.

The tour started on Monday in London.

The Advocate can reveal that Elliot Pouchthroat made the decision to tell his travelling companions that he was a lot younger than what he was because he didn’t want to be seen as being too old for the popular rite-of-passage.

“Look me in the eye and tell me that you’d want to go on Contiki with a 36-year-old single tech worker from the middle of the Simpson Desert,” he told our reporter via Skype.

“Just let me live, you cunts. This might be the last time I can do something like this, something completely reckless like drop everything, quit your job and travel the world,”

“And by the world, I mean Europe. Anyway, fuck you, you fucking piece of shit hack journalist fuck heads. Publish this if you want, I’m out.”

The pale Leo then closed the chat window and blocked The Advocate’s official Skype account.

But it wasn’t until our reporter got in touch with one of Mr Pouchthroat’s bus mates that the extent of his fraud became apparent – or lack thereof.

Though he’s gone to great length to say just how young he is, nobody on the bus has been fooled by the ruse.

“Going through passport control, we all laugh at each other’s shitty pictures in the line. Elliot chucked us his passport and it said the cunt was born in like the 1980s. We had a laugh after but it’s not like we give a shit,”

“I reckon he even remembers the Berlin Wall coming down! [laughs] Nah, he’s a good bloke. Bit weird but I guess everyone gets a little weird when they’re still living a directionless existence at 36,”

“Anyway, next stop if Paris and the tour leader says we should tape phonebooks to our torsos because the knife crime here is out of control apparently. Enough to make a Glaswegian homesick they reckon.”

Local Girl Confirms That Her Best Friend Is, In Fact, A Human In Touching Birthday Tribute

TEXT:

South Betoota girl Sally Alcorn’s best friend Josie is 22 today, she is also a human – that’s according to a touching Facebook tribute that has clarified that Josie is indeed a descendant of the hominins species who first used fire and occupied much of Eurasia.

“Happy birthday to this human <3” posts Sally.

“Couldn’t ask for a better human to call my best friend”

Modern humans (Homo sapiens) are the only extant members of the subtribe Hominina, a branch of the tribe Hominini belonging to the family of great apes. They are characterized by erect posture and bipedal locomotion; high manual dexterity and heavy tool use compared to other animals; and a general trend toward larger, more complex brains and societies.

While last year’s birthday post covered the trials and tribulations of their rock solid friendship since their first year out of school, this year’s post was a lot more simple – and has been of great convenience to Sally’s friends who weren’t sure if she hung around with other homosapiens socially.

Further more to Sally’s claim, Josie’s response in the comments section is also quite humanlike.

“Thanks girl. You’re my favourite human too <3”

Other humans interacted with these posts using hearts emojis. A symbol commonly associated with the human emotion of love.

Rite-Of-Passage Complete As Local Teen Pushes Shopping Trolley Into Body Of Water

TEXT:

A 15-year-old Betoota Ponds skatepark regular has taken another step toward manhood this afternoon by pushing a shopping trolley off the Dixon Street overpass into the creek four-meters below.

Bryce Clayton, of Blaxland Avenue, spoke to our reporters just moments after he cast the Spar cart to its watery grave.

“I can’t speak for very long, the cops are probably on their way down here, bruz,” he said.

“But yeas, boss. Pissa, aye? Throwing carts off the Dicko bridge is what everyone does around here. Me brother done it a few years ago and even my Dad did it in the 70s. Anyway bra, gotta run. Cheers.”

But not everybody in the local area is too pleased with this coming-of-age story.

Just last year, another local youth was cooling off during a hot summers day by heading down the same creek for a swim.

Where the bridge is on the creek it holes up and provides a bit of depth, which why it’s a popular spot to do ‘a few double backies’ in front of some female classmates.

Tragically, on this occasion, the young man double backflipped onto a submerged pile of shopping carts and broke both his legs.

That incident lead to a town-wide ban on throwing shopping trolleys into bodies of water – but people like Bryce say tradition is more important than bureaucracy.

“Oi blokes will be throwing trolleys into creeks forever, mate,”

“It’s just what we do.”

Parents Ask Private School For Refund After Son Gets Job On His Own Merit

TEXT:

Two local parents are reportedly livid this morning after their privately-educated son managed to secure a good job based upon his own merits.

Wanda and Jerome Watson, of Grenache Street in Betoota Grove, say they’ve been swindled by The Whooton School to the tune of almost $250 000 – and they want it back.

The controversy began when Alex Watson, a former pupil of the school, failed to secure a place at a sandstone university.

“That was the first straw,” said Jerome.

“We didn’t pay all that money for our son to be a fuck up. Not in my wildest dreams did I think he’d attend a tertiary institution with more gum trees than London planes!”

“It was horrible,” echoed Wanda.

“He left that school without a single good connection and we fell out with him after he told us he didn’t want to be a lawyer like his father, or a doctor like my father. It was a tough time but this is the final straw.”

The parents filed proceedings against Whooton in the Betoota Local Court this morning after their son told them he’d landed a job as a diesel mechanic after his 4-year apprenticeship at a local uranium mine.

“He got that job without even so much as a personal reference from me,” said Jerome.

“I didn’t even need to make a call or ask a favour. This is disgusting and it’s not what I paid for. Alex has nothing to be proud of, he should be ashamed that he’s gone behind our backs on this. I spoke to his new boss, who said Alex was the best candidate for the job, which is why he hired him. It nearly made me vomit into my Apple Watch!”

“We’ve commenced legal action against the school to recoup our losses on our son. He could’ve gone to the local high school had we known he wanted to work with his hands for a living.”

The Advocate spoke exclusively to Alex regarding his parent’s plan to sue his old school.

The softly-spoken 24-year-old said that he just enjoys working outside with the sun on his back and that he doesn’t harbour any resentment toward his parents – he saves it for alma mater.

“I think using the school is a bit much, I mean, it’s got our family in the media which is fucked,” he said.

“But yeah, look. I probably didn’t need to go to Whooton. It’s a school run by fuck heads for fuck heads. But it’s not like I had any say in the matter, Mum and Dad would’ve been laughed out of the yacht club if they sent me to the high school,”

“And I’ve got the hand-eye of a stoned panda so I wasn’t getting a scholarship. Anyway, this job rocks and they’re expanding into Bolivia next year, opening another mine or something and they want me to go – and I’m sure as shit going.”

Local Vaper In The Mood For An Acoustic Cigarette

Korin Petersen is the type of young go-getter that grabs the bull’s horns with both hands, slides his legs around its neck and takes the ride.

Which he why today, of all days, the 3D modder feels like taking it back to where it all started.

Two-milligram cigarettes – and he’s sure as shit not about to buy a pack.

Which is why he’s enlisted the help of a co-worker, who joined him at a French Quarter cafe to find a cure their three-thirty-itis.

“Hey bruv,” he said, in a faux Manchester accent.

“Mind if I borrow one of dem [sic] acoustic cigarettes from your person, like?”

His colleagued obliged and even offered the use of his lighter, despite there being a ‘nationwide gas shortage’.

“That’s the shit, innit? Haven’t had an organic vape like this for weeks, man.”

“Just what I needed, man.”

However, Doug Sampson, who joined Korin at the cafe, was still trying to process what had just happened.

He asked Korin what he meant by the term.

“I call my vape a digital durry, like. And I call those organic ones acoustic cigarettes because they’re not electric.”

“Right,” said Doug.

“I think we should start walking back now, the boss is probably wondering where we are.”

“Why Am I Like This?” Asks Man Reading Memes At 3AM On A Tuesday

TEXT:

He blames his chronic tiredness on the heat and his flat personality on his lack of sleep but the truth to Sam Franklin’s lack-of-life is in his nocturnal phone habits.

Speaking to our reporter this afternoon with the same dead-eyes he uses to avoid emails with, the 24-year-old office person said he often tries to go to sleep on time, he just can’t.

“I know my phone is keeping me up, I’ve read enough clickbait articles to know that looking at memes at 3 am probably isn’t going to put me to sleep,” he said.

“Why do I do it? I don’t know. Maybe because looking at memes distracts me from my own thoughts about life and where it’s going. If I’m doing OK, if I know what I’m doing. It’s hard to go to sleep when you’ve got such a hypercritical monologue playing on repeat in the back of your mind,”

“Looking at memes to the point of absolute exhaustion, whereby the primal systems inside your brain overpower the hubris and you fall asleep mercifully at 4:12 am, is the only way I’m able to do it. Why am I like this?”

A recent government study of young people and why they do the things they do concluded that there are no answers at the bottom of a screen – no matter how much you scroll.

The CSIRO has suggested that dwelling on life after midnight is unnecessary as nobody actually knows what they’re doing and the ones that say they do are lying.

“We’ve discovered that perhaps doing like maybe halfa of some pretty hard running or something can really knacker you out,” said one CSIRO person.

“Also, there’s clear evidence to suggest that nobody, including the CSIRO, knows what they’re doing. We’re all just tiny bits of space dust on a rock in the middle of a giant vacuum,”

“What else do you want me to say?”

Local Television Packed Away For Another Year As Reality TV Season Kicks Off

TEXT:

As the cricket takes a turn for the worse and the tennis ends in a bang, one local man has called time on his TV viewing for another year.

The move comes as reality television returns to screens around the nation, something that Harris Goblin takes mild offence to.

“Honestly, I wanted to give that celebrity jungle show a go because I get around the man Mundine hard but Jesus wept, it’s pretty grim viewing,” said the 29-year-old.

“Don’t get me started on the other shit. Those marriage shows and the cooking ones. Spare me. I’d rather get punched in the forehead every morning by Anthony Joshua bare fist than watch Scott Cam mumble his way through another renovation show,”

“So I’m packing the TV until the cricket starts again at the end of the year. It’s been real.”

But when asked what he plans to do about the winter sports, the league and footy, the Betoota Heights resident explained that he’d frequent one of the many licensed premises around his home.

Goblin, a full-time city worker, explained to The Advocate that on a game day, the group chat is already in full swing by lunchtime and venue is locked in before knockoff.

“I could save money by watching sport at home but honestly, it’s a small price to pay for peace of mind,” he said.

“They’ve got the HD Austar here, no ads, the barman turns it up for us and we get to spin yarns until 9 pm,”

“Just try and tell me I’m not living the dream.”

Corporate Bromance Taken To Next Level As Two Suits Realise They Both Like Doing Coke

Not many genuine friendships are able to survive the tumultuous seas that come with a career working in stockbroking.

However, two local suits look like they are about the prove this theory wrong.

Jack Birmingham-Whitely and Vincent Lee, both of the Betoota stockbroking firm Ackerie & Partners, have enjoyed having the odd schooner with each other for several months now – but following a tense and risky conversation yesterday afternoon, they are now best work mates.

“How was the long weekend?” asks Vinnie.

Without giving it too much thought, Jack responds.

“Yeah not bad. Had a big one on the bags on Satur…”

Both men freeze.

“Umm. Yeah, big night on the beers” says Jack.

Vincent isn’t gonna let this one slide, and as his eyes intimately lock with Jack’s, he makes a face as to say “you too?”

Both men crack up into an obnoxious fit of laughter that both excludes and interrupts their non-cocaine-doing colleagues.

“What’s doing tonight? ask Vincent.

“Haha”

Both men continue laughing while nonverbally acknowledging that they will be doing class A drugs later at the local corporate pub, Brian’s Bar.

However, while the senior execs at the firm say it’s good to see another generation starting their own toxic boys club in their prestigious South Betoota office – they also know these synthetic feelings of corporate ‘mateship’ are very shortlived.

“This ‘workmates’ stuff never lasts” says high ranking Betoota stockbroker Jeff Ackerie (71).

“Eventually, when they have glided past all the women and blokes they don’t like sport, they’ll be fighting each other for partner. That’s when it turns sour”

“Unless it doesn’t happen earlier when they both fall in love with the same uninterested receptionist”

“But for now, I wish them luck getting to know eachother over a few bags”

Local Bushie Forced To Use Indicators After Seeing The Copper Behind Him

A Betoota Heights man has reportedly told friends this afternoon that he only indicates leaving a roundabout whenever there’s a policeman in the vicinity.

Gregor Redpath’s friends recoiled in horror as he admitted the repeated legal trespasses over his third pot of lager at the Cashew & Pogostick Hotel.

“Jesus wept, Gregor!” said one fellow hotel patron.

“You can just say that out loud! What if somebody hears? They’ll put you in handcuffs on the spot. Traffic cops drink in this hotel all time!”

Gregor smiled and finished his drink.

“Yeah,” he said.

“They also drive home half cut like us, as well.”

With that, he took a short headcount of what he needed to order as it was his shout.

Once inside, our reporter spoke to some other locals who just learned what Gregor’s been doing.

“You need to indicate when you leave a roundabout,” said Gavin, a friend.

“Everybody knows somebody who’s been booked for not doing it. Hell, I’ve heard of a bloke losing his licence over it. These small towns aren’t as big as you think. People talk,”

“But you can’t just be getting half a gutful of piss in you and bragging about breaking the law thousands of times! There are literally 30 or 40 roundabouts in Betoota alone. God knows how he hasn’t been caught yet.”

The Advocate phoned the Betoota Heights police station for comment and received clarification on the law.

“Well, yeah,” said probationary constable Mike Catt.

“Ah right. Yeah look. It all depends on how a certain policeman is feeling, I guess. It’s like jaywalking. One day you might get book, one day you might get away with it in front of a policeman.

“Food for thought. Surely you’ve got something from that. Thanks.”

Adelaide’s Last Candle Shop To Close As City Enters Third Month Without Blackout

TEXT:

An industry that once supported close to 15 000 workers is set to die in the coming months as South Australia’s candle industry teeters on the brink of collapse.

The demise has been blamed on the installation of the Telsa Jamestown battery, which has saved the city from being plunged into a blackout a number of times in recent months.

Only a handful of Adelaide candle shops remain in business as of today and one owner spoke to The Advocate candidly about the drop in business.

“It’s been real hard on the local wick, wax and candle industry this Telsa battery has,” said Gabriel Sock, owner-operator of The Candle Shop in Prospect.

“We’ve already laid off most of our staff. My kids are working here for nothing trying to keep the business afloat. Honestly, I don’t know how much longer we can go on like this,”

“The bank is breathing down our necks, we haven’t made a mortgage payment in three months and they’re threatening to foreclose on the shop. We need government assistance right now before the whole industry goes under. Help us, Malcolm Turnbull, help us.”

Candles were the most popular choice for most Adelaidanese people as well as the South Australian population on the whole when the power went out.

What used to be an almost daily occurrence, the state hasn’t suffered a power outage since the battery was switched on in late November.

The next premier of the state, Nick Xenophon, has vowed to tear the battery down and restore the older coal-fired power stations – which he hopes will ease the pressure on the local candle industry.

“Should I be elected to lead South Australia at the next election, my first priority will be to disable these ‘so-called’ battery packs,” he said.

“My office will hire a pair of D9’s and a length of good anchor chain and we’ll pull that country, push the batteries up in a heap and burn them down like we did with all the mulga back in the day,”

“It’s about protecting South Australian jobs and industry, not about lining the pockets of some overseas businessman with hair plugs and a Hugo Boss sports coat!”

Our reporter also attended as Bobby said he had something special to show The Advocate.

“So homemade fish tacos are on the menu today,” he said, kinda half laughing as he bounced to the music.

“Got them from Jamie Oliver’s cookbook. Said they’d take 30 minutes but I did it in 24. Anyway, they’re pretty tame just as they are but if you really want to unlock some taste, you gotta add some spice.”

The 59-year-old smiled and nodded.

“Some super spicy sauce.”

And with that, Bobby walked over to the pantry and retrieved a bottle of some extra hot sauce he saves for special occasions.

“Here,” he said softly.

“Put a little bit of this stuff on it. Not too much, you don’t want to set your mouth on fire.”

Bobby offered our reporter the bottle after squirting a rather conservative amount on his fish tacos.

“Wooo!” Billy shouted as Julia enjoyed the schadenfreude.

“That’s got dam [sic] hot, man! Yikes! Zoo-weee-mama! My mouth is on fire right now!”

Our reporter also noted that the sauce was quite hot.

“You want some milk? Jesus Christ, I’m hallucinating. Was there some DMT in this bitch?!”

Julia lightly slapped the back of Bobby’s head for swearing.

From there, our reporter concluded the interview and turned off the recorder.

He’s now downstairs in The Advocate’s darkroom where it’s quite cool, sitting on the floor in the dark with a John Player Special and a cone of vanilla gelato.

“This Should Be Higher” Explains Music Fan Who Didn’t Vote In The Hottest 100

TEXT:

Equipped with more contemporary music knowledge than almost anybody in living memory, Conch Willis confidently stated that a popular track from last October should’ve been higher than where placed on Triple J’s Hottest 100 Countdown this afternoon.

“Woah!” uttered the 27-year-old, almost choking on his Corona.

“That’s bullshit. This should’ve been way higher than that. This is an absolute track. Triple J has no idea what they’re doing.”

Janna Smithson, a fellow listening party guest, turned to him and nodded in agreement.

“Yeah, this is a tune.”

Despite his protests, The Advocate can reveal that the local cafe owner didn’t even vote in the schoolyard style popularity contest – not does he understand that the station’s employees don’t choose the order themselves.

Conch, whose hippy parents named him after a tropical marine mollusc, was so annoyed this latest misstep by the Millennial and jaded Gen-X population that he finished his beer and flicked the bottle to get the lime wedge out, making it easier to recycle.

Study Finds People Who Ride Electric Push Bikes Are More Likely To Cheat In Other Areas Of Life Too

TEXT:

A year-long study carried out by the behavioural science unit at the CSIRO has today given Australians yet another reason to hate push bike riders, more specifically, a lazy subclass – the motorised push bike rider. Already considered cheats by their peers, the study has revealed that their dishonest behaviour doesn’t stop when the helmet’s removed.

The Advocate spoke with caricature-like lead researcher, Dr. Paul Sharpe, shortly after the results were released to the public to uncover how he came to this breakthrough conclusion and what it might mean for the future of Australians.

“A colleague of ours, who rides a motorised push bike, was caught cheating in our office game of Words With Friends” Sharpe recounts with conflicting excitement and disdain.

“What kind of human would do this? We collectively thought, and that was our lightbulb moment”

The results stipulate a staggering 98% of people who ride motorised push bikes are likely to cheat in other areas of life. According to the study, the remaining two percent are people who don’t have legs, hence needing the motor in order to move.

“We are on the cusp of changing how society functions. Imagine if you could determine who was likely to cheat at something before they did!”

“Sporting events, monopoly, insider trading – if people involved in these areas ride a motorised push bike, they’re almost certainly a dishonest cheat.”

The Advocate understands that Dr. Sharpe is now working directly with the Australian Federal Police and the ACCC to weed out and punish these stains on society.

Study: Two Vegans Whining At Barbeque Can Cancel Each Other Out

TEXT:

“Hey! Max said you were vegan as well? My name is Sammy,” he said.

Greg shook Sammy’s outstretched hand and smiled.

“Yeah! Hate coming to these things but you know how it is! I’m Greg, Max works with my wife.”

Sammy laughed and said he did too, then told everyone in earshot that he’d been a vegan, too.

As the afternoon carried on, the new friends traded old war stories of barbecues past and chortled among themselves over the sheer omnivorous ignorance of everyone else mingling in Max’s backyard.

The time came to grill the meats – the sound of plastic wrap being pulled from supermarket trays, the crinkling of butchers paper unfolding followed finally by the hot sound of sizzle filling the air.

They moved upwind of the grill.

“Are they really going to eat all those lamb chops? There’s like 40 of them,” said Greg.

“You’d be surprised. They all rant and rave about how good they are. They’ll hoover them. God, this rate of consumption is so unsustainable.”

“Oh my God! I know, right?” Sammy replied.

Max, who asked them if they’d like a peanut butter sandwich or something, interrupted their solace on the edge of the party.

They both looked at each other then back at Max.

“Yeah, sure. We’d love that, thanks.”

Smiling back, Max retired inside to the kitchen and spoke quietly to his wife, Melba, who was preparing a garden salad.

“It was such a good idea to invite another vegan,” she said.

“Tell me about it. I read about this study the CSIRO did about handling vegans at barbeques and they said the best way to stop a vegan whining was to make sure there’s two of them there.”

The study Max is referring to was published earlier this week in the lead up to the long weekend where it’s expected close to a million vegetarians and vegans will attend barbeques around the country.

In the report, the nation’s peak scientific body outlined that the best way to cancel out the complaints, snide comments and uppity lecturing that can come with inviting a vegan to a social gathering is to invite another one.

“These people gravitate toward each other, like magnets or something,” said the report.

“If there’s two vegans at a barbeque, they can cancel each other out by talking amongst themselves. Also, vegans can eat peanut butter so make sure to offer them a peanut butter sandwich. If they’re also gluten-free, just hand them a spoon of it.”

Plastic Schooners A Fair Indication Someone Was Naughty At This Local Venue Once

TEXT:

As per local government law, a glassing at a popular Betoota Grove gastropub has resulted in the venue being forced to serve drinks in plastic glassware for the foreseeable future.

The Docking Sailors, which ambiguously states it was founded in 1899 despite being a tasteless renovation of the former venue, played host to a vicious and cowardly attack earlier this year that saw a man receive close to 90 internal and external stitches.

As the case is before the courts and the names suppressed, The Advocate can only state that an interim ban has been placed on all glassware in the venue while officials investigate what happened.

Which means the upper crust of the town’s population now has to enjoy a cool, refreshing $9 schooner of Diamantina Pale Ale out of a scuffed plastic glass.

Over lunch, local hedge fund manager and gun owner Bruce Hall said his experience at the venue was marred by the offensive and tacky glassware.

“You go in there and order the $39 sirloin, they hand you back a buzzer and a flat beer in a plastic schooner glass,” he said.

“And ASIC think we’re the criminals. Honestly, if one fired-up piss head with anger problems can fuck a good pub like the Docking, then we’ve devolved as a fucking species,”

“But yeah, back to what you were saying. When you walk into a pub and they’ve got plastic glassware, it’s a pretty good indication some shit has gone down here and some poor cunt has been glassed. People who glass people should be hanged from the streetlamps and their organs given to the needy.”

Bruce stopped to catch his breath after that explosive rant, which gave enough time for our reporter to slip out the discreet VIP room exit.

Graphic Podcast About Serial Killers Adds Pizzazz To Office Person’s Otherwise Boring Commute

TEXT:

Rather than bob his head along to the Top 40 like he used to do, Mark Douglas is now a podcast person.

The Betoota Heights resident and H Train regular is a recent subscriber of the popular Outback Strangler podcast which goes through a number of unsolved murders in the wider district.

Despite a thorough investigation by local police, homicide detectives from the cosmopolitan south-east and reporters here at The Advocate – all of the cases remain cold thirty years later.

“It makes for compelling listening,” said the man who receives money for doing things inside an office.

“All those people the killer, or killers murdered. And their families. Jesus. But yeah, I’m addicted to it. It’s great and I like all the graphic details, like the presenter full on tells you how they died,”

“So interesting but so fucked up at the same time.”

The podcast is written and presented by Clive Overell, first-cousin-once-removed of Clancy Overell, editor of The Advocate.

Though he’s estranged from most of his family for repeatedly exposing himself at a family wedding, Clive’s podcast about the unsolved murders garners over a thousand local downloads a week and continues to grow around the state.

He didn’t want to comment publically on the podcast but released a short statement on the success of his project.

“I’m happy all these people can find such entertainment and enjoyment out of these shocking, horrible crimes,” he said.

“If it wasn’t for you, nobody would be talking about these crimes. I hope one day we can solve them.”

Hideous Building Gets A Pass Because Owner Says It’s ‘Art Deco’

TEXT:

The owners of a visually displeasing house in Betoota’s old Meatworkers district have been praised by local council for keeping the building just as ugly as it was when it was built in the 1940s.

Situated at number 3 Daroo street, the house has had only three owners since it first began violating the eyes of the locals, and has retained it’s same Californian-style sky-blue colour for the entire duration.

Despite even the owners themselves admitting that the architecture hasn’t aged well, they refuse to alter it in any way – at the advice of a few smug local art and design historians.

“Yeah” says the owner.

“It’s Art Deco”

Art Deco, sometimes referred to as Deco, is a style of visual arts, architecture and design that first appeared in France just before World War I. Art Deco influenced the design of buildings, furniture, jewellery, fashion, cars, movie theatres, trains, ocean liners, and everyday objects such as radios and vacuum cleaners. It took its name, short for Arts Décoratifs, from the Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes held in Paris in 1925.

It is this particular style that has millions of inner-suburban streets around Australia fall victim to the circular concrete facades and tall Baptist church-style windows made popular between the world wars.

It combined modernist styles with fine craftsmanship and rich materials. During its heyday, Art Deco represented luxury, glamour, exuberance, and faith in social and technological progress – nowadays the term is generally used to excuse ugly buildings that are being assessed for a heritage listing.

Shift Worker Contemplates Life Eating Servo Sandwich Alone In Car At 3AM

TEXT:

Another eventless evening drew to a close at the Dolphins Leagues Club at 10 pm last night.

Roger Dunston rang the bell for last drinks, locked the pokies, took the tills and told the barman to get them all out by 10:30.

It’s not the 24-year-old’s first rodeo and it certainly won’t be his last.

But until his ship comes in and his dreams begin to take shape, it’s all the unpopular hotel manager has to hold on to.

Bidding the bar staff goodbye as they necked the rest of their staffies, the last D45 bus to the French Quarter gargled up the hill toward the club.

“You can often hear the bus before you see it, especially late a night,” he said.

“But yeah, last night wasn’t like any other. It was just another Tuesday being underemployed working in hospitality, I guess.”

As the clock struck midnight, he counted the safe to find that it was almost exactly $2000 down for the day.

He counted the tills again.

After an hour of investigation, he discovered a large pokie payout around lunchtime that the day manager neglected to write up on the office whiteboard. It was almost $2000.

Relieved, he locked up sent a passive-aggressive email to the other managers and the owner regarding the importance of using the ‘fucking’ whiteboard.

It was then, when he’d finally stopped moving and thinking for the day, that he realised he hadn’t eaten since lunch.

So on the drive home, he stopped at The Busy Bee service station on the Old City District limits and went inside to peruse the limited takeaway menu.

Not pies in the hotbox, not even a shepherds.

His hunger was too much for a packet of CCs or a Maxibon. He toyed with the idea of having a Chocolate Moove.

Young Roger made his choice, paid for it in silver coins he scraped out of his XF Falcon’s never-used ashtray and pulled into the servo’s parking area away from the pumps to have his dinner.

“In the end, I went with an egg and lettuce sandwich from the fridge. I wanted something hot but you can’t have a win every day,”

“Look, it is what it is. The sandwich wasn’t great. If I were a gambling man, I would’ve bet on those eggs in the sandwich being laid in about October last year. The bread was soggy and impregnated with egg juice. But it succeeded in making me not hungry so whatever. If I don’t get sick from it, I’ll have another one,”

He looked up at the moon and thought about the day when he wouldn’t have to live this life anymore.

“Turns out there’s not too much career work on at the moment, especially when you’ve got an Arts degree in history and art criticism,”

“At least I’ve got a home and a bed. It could be worse; way, way, way worse,”

“But at the same time, things could be so, so much better than they are now.”

Woke Toddler’s Political Insights Relayed To World Via His Parent’s Facebook Account

TEXT:

Little Wolfgang Spencer of Greenpoint Road in Betoota Grove has had his wisdom, which is beyond his years, relayed to the world via his father’s Facebook account this morning.

As the Australia Day Long Weekend fast approaches, the bright two-year-old quested his father why not everyone in the country can enjoy the holiday.

The exchange was quoted verbatim by Peter Spencer, Wolfie’s dad, and shared with his Facebook followers:

At only two-years-old, my son Wolfie is already so wise! He came to me this morning when I was having breakfast and checking my share portfolio and he asked me:
“Daddy, why can’t every Australian celebrate Australia Day?”
I told him it was a complex issue that a lot of people are passionate about. Then he said “Can’t everybody just love each other like you and Mummy?”
I teared up and said maybe one day. One day we might be able to live together as one.

As of 11:30 am today, the post has garnered two likes and one share, one being Peter himself and the other his wife Morag, who also felt compelled to share it.

Speaking exclusively to The Advocate about his son’s poise and acumen, Peter explained that Wolfie often displays signs of genius and ability – even at such a young age.

“Sometimes it takes a two-year-old’s understanding of the world to make you question your own,” he said.

“Wolfie is such a curious boy, some of the woke things he says leaves me shook. But a good shook, the type of pensive shookness that leads to personal growth. Most of the other kids in his daycare are still eating paint and pissing on the rug,”

“And my son is questioning the very fabric by which our society lives by. My wife and I think he’s got what it takes to be the first Greens PM in history. With pangs of both upper and working classes running through his veins, I think that should be more of a reality than a dream.”

But not everyone was convinced that Wolfie was being the insightful political commentary.

The Advocate‘s editor-in-chief, Clancy Overell, has a bastard son in Wolfgang’s class at Koala Cottage Day Care on Mulholland Drive.

He’s also Facebook friends with Peter Spencer and can testify to the amount of ‘Wolfgang-related wisdom posts’ that Spencer feels obligated to share.

“My boy has barely stopped smearing his shit all over the walls of his mother’s place,” he said.

“I can just tell his going to a handful as a teenager. Anyway, point is that Pete’s little shit doesn’t say these things. There’s zero fucking chance of that. I’ve seen him playing in the sandpit down the Koala Cottage, the kid found himself a bit of cat shit he liked so much he put it in his mouth,”

“Apparently the very same mouth that’s on the verge of solving every problem the world has ever had. Hey Wolfie, what’s your opinion on peak oil? Oh that’s right, you can barely fucking string a sentence together. Actually, can you not print this? I know it’s my call anyway but we’re going to a BBQ with him and if he reads this, it’ll be pretty awkward. Cheers.”

“Just Like New York!” Says Man Enjoying A $12 Plastic Schooner At A Sydney Rooftop Bar

TEXT:

As Toploader’s ‘Dancing In The Moonlight‘ softly plays over the PA system, the lift opens and Tim Rowland is blown away by what he sees.

He’s just arrived at one of Sydney’s most exclusive and hip rooftop bars, Autofellatio, which has been open since late November.

“Cool,” he thought to himself.

“I wonder if I’m the first here. Ah, yeah. It looks like I am. Might as well make my way to the bar and get myself a drink!”

As it was 4 pm on a Tuesday afternoon, the 34-year-old advertising executive had no trouble negotiating deep lines for drinks – he even had time to peruse the wine list.

“Hey bud, can I grab a frosty Pure Blonde there? Cheers.”

Tim let his head bob to the intoxicating music while he felt a wave of personal self-satisfaction wash over him.

He’d made it. There he was on the coolest rooftop bar in the coolest city in the country, waiting for his coworkers to join him. It was just like the memories he has of visiting New York City, the home of the rooftop bar.

“That’ll be $12, thanks,” said the barman.

“Geez, that’s a bit steep,” Tim thought to himself.

“I might have to transfer some money out of my cryptocurrency savings account later on if this night kicks up a gear.”

He forced a smiling tapping his Visa Debit card against EFTPOS terminal while the apron-wearing barman also forced a smile until the transaction was approved.

Not letting the price of beer on the top of the Chinese-owned building bother him, Tim spotted his colleagues in a corner nook, right under a speaker that was now blaring ‘Juicy‘ by Biggie Smalls for the third time that afternoon.

“Just like New York, hey guys?” said Tim.

“I dunno, man. I’ve never been. Is it good?” said one coworker.

Tim thought long and hard about that question, he studied the pilling on his art director’s $79 Tarocash sportscoat while he pondered.

Remembering the time he passed on the E train and woke up at the Jamaica Centre getting his head kicked in by opportunistic street urchins.

Or when he felt let down by the dollar slice pizza he got from a Time Square takeaway shop.

“Yeah,” he said.

“I think New York is worth going to. It’s way better than this dump, anyway.”

Report: Sunday Roast Easiest Way To Get Adult Children To Visit Home

TEXT:

A year-long study into the most effective way to make adult children revisit the nest has concluded this afternoon and the results are quite telling.

That’s according to the Betoota Chapter President of the Country Women’s Association, who told The Advocate this afternoon that the promise of a home-cooked meal and some couch time is often just enough to lure busy 20-something kids back to home.

Tracey Lucijet has been at the helm of the local CWA team for close to a decade and shared the study’s findings with our reporter this afternoon.

“Telephoning your kids on a Saturday morning is often best before they go out to the pubs and clubs. You say there’s a lamb pot roast on for Sunday night and it’d be great if they could make it. That’s where you leave it,” she said.

“By the time Sunday evening rolls around, they’re typically so broke and defeated that the idea of having a roast dinner for free at home seems irresistible,”

“Of course this only works if your children still live in this bustling inland port. For those with children far away, I feel for you as well.”

The CWA’s findings have been confirmed and recommended by Australia’s peak scientific body, the CSIRO, who said to The Advocate a short time ago that Mum’s roast dinner can often cure a number of ailments.

Products such as lamb, beef and turkey are high in essential vitamins, iron and minerals, which the CSIRO say is helpful in replenishing the body after a night on the tiles.

“There’s not much better for the brain after an evening in a dark, sweaty room with loud music than a big slice of meat and vegetables,” they said.

“Coupled with the social and mental benefits of seeming your parents, science hasn’t yet caught up with nature on this one,”

“So yes, the advice we can give to young people on this is that if Mum is offering you a spot at the dinner table on Sunday night, you take that spot and say thank you.”

Learning To Drive: Mum’s Firm Grip On The Jesus Handle And Sharp Breaths Not Helping

TEXT:

Keen to gain a little bit of independence, Cameron Frost chomped at the opportunity to get his learners permit mere hours after he turned 16.

Now tasked with the challenge of learning to drive an automobile, the spritely fourth-former’s parents have risen to the occasion and have spent the past few weeks trying to help Cameron build his hours up.

But, as most young men can agree, the moon-headed Cancerian prefers to drive with his father as he’s much less vocal and timid when it comes to his driving.

“Every time I go for a drive with Mum, she grabs onto the bloody Jesus handle and starts hyperventilating like she’s just seen the ghost of her dead aunt,” he said.

“Not like Dad, he just looks scared half the time and tells me to either slow down or look out. That’s more constructive than just sitting there whimpering. I’m not even that bad of a driver. Ah, how many times have I crashed? None.”

According to Cameron’s mother, Tania, it’s only a matter of time until that day comes.

Speaking to The Advocate shortly after returning from the Betoota Heights shops with her son, the popular local solicitor said he son is a madman behind the wheel and she fears for the day he gets his provisional licence.

“He drives so fast,” she said.

“So, so fast. I try to be supportive and give him feedback on his driving but he takes it so personally that I feel uncomfortable doing it. The Jesus handle, at least, makes me feel safer when he’s zipping down those narrow roads near the shops,”

“His father is of the same opinion.”

Though he wasn’t a quick to condemn his son’s driving, Miles Frost told our reporters that he can hardly talk – saying that he’s written off more than one vehicle in his time and that the stories he’s told his son over the years might have contributed to his behaviour.

When Cameron was just a boy, his father’s driving style wasn’t to be admired.

He’d put the indicator on to overtake and put the boot into the AU Fairmont, feeling the kick down as Miles pulled out onto the wrong side of the road.

100, 120, whiz past the wheat truck, 130, 150 and then it’d kick up into top gear and they’d be back safely on their side of the road.

“Maybe that had influenced his driving,” said Miles.

“But yeah, I can’t tell the kid he drives like a fuck head because that’d be hypocritical of me. It just goes to show that kids learn from you. Anyway, I don’t grab the Jesus handle because I need to be ready to grab the wheel or flick the fucking thing back into neutral and reef the handbrake on.”

“I Wore A White Dress To A Wedding On Purpose And Lived To Tell The Tale”

TEXT:

Peggy Spudmann told our reporters that she attended a wedding on Saturday wearing a lacey white dress on purpose, just to see what would happen.

Along with her polite but ultimately plain husband, Gary, they jagged an invitation to the wedding of a workmate of his – so in Peggy’s own words, she didn’t know the couple very well.

Late last week, Gary picked up his favourite pilling grey suit from the dry cleaners while Peggy went shopping for something to wear.

“I fell in love instantly with this dress,” she said, joining our reporter at a busy French Quarter cafe.

“But it was white and quite elaborately finished. It looks divine, I shit you not. Look at these pictures of me in it. Doesn’t it fit well?”

“Anyway, though I was going to a wedding, I thought, ‘Fuck it, I barely know them. I’ll just wear it,’ and as it turns out, I was lucky to leave the upstairs function room of the Dolphins Leagues Club alive!”

The Advocate reached out to some of the other wedding guests regarding the events on Saturday and a number stepped forward.

One of those who agreed to speak on the record with The Advocate was Sacha Ryan, who was a bridesmaid at the wedding.

The picture Ms Ryan paints with her words is vivid and vengeful.

“The bride, who doesn’t want to comment on what happened, was mortified,” she said.

“This fucking bitch comes in with her white dress, white clutch and some shitty white flats. She looked great but that’s beside the point. Who the fuck does that? We didn’t even know who she was. Apparently, her husband works with Mark, the groom,”

“We really wanted to go over there and see what in the good fuck she was thinking but we ended up death staring her the whole night. Someone should’ve ‘accidentally’ spilt a glass of red on her or something. Anyway, I don’t want to talk about it anymore. It didn’t ruin what turned out to be a magical evening.”

When asked if she planned on wearing the dress to another wedding, Mrs Spudmann said only if she didn’t know the bride.

“You can wear anything you want to a wedding if you don’t know the bride,” she said.

“But now I know people actually get really cross with you if you wear something vaguely resembling a wedding dress.”

Hottest Chick From High School Returns From Gap Year With Politically-Charged Rebrand

TEXT:

Arguably the meanest and most socially influential girl from your finishing class at high school has returned back to town with a completely new image.

Its has been reported by her former confidantes that Evie Peterson (20) is no longer interested in dating older guys with fairly good prospects of playing in the NRL, but instead is more caught up with the extremist Buddhists in Myanmar’s treatment of the oppressed Rohingya Muslims.

When asked if she was still keen on spending three nights in a row in the same socially elite nightclub each weekend, Evie says she’s more into live music these days – and not like the DJ stuff that the girls still like seeing, it’s more folk-protest-rock.

“Yeah, I don’t see many of those girls nowadays” she says, when asked about if she has caught up with the tribe of young women who’s quality of life was all so dependant on her mood for the good part of a decade.

“I think they are still hanging out with the same crowd. I kind of expanded my circle bit more when I went O-S [overseas]”

By overseas, Evie means she spent 12 months supervising the dorms of a 200-year-old British private school, before visiting her parents in France for a couple weeks and eventually flying home via India, for a bit of yoga.

“Yeah. I guess I’ve met a pretty different crowd” she says before making quite a scene about rolling a marijuana cigarette.

When asked her thoughts on the most recent dual-citizenship scandal and almost imminent Australian federal election, Evie says she really hasn’t been paying much attention to Australian politics, because she was overseas for so much of last year and only landed like a couple months before Christmas.

“I mean, Australians are just so privileged. I’m really not that engaged with our politics when we have Romani travellers fighting for their right to be officially recognised on the UK census”

“I guess I’m just not a small town girl, like I’m probably going to move to Melbourne soon” she says.

At time of press Evie was seen playing hackey sack with some Timorese nationals in the rapidly gentrifying Betoota Ponds’ farmers markets.

Shock As Man Forms Opinion After Reading Entire Article – Not Just The Headline

TEXT:

Picking up The Advocate this morning, the front page made Phil Durham choke on his honeyed Wonder White slice.

“Kid A,” he coughed.

“Now way in hell is that the best Radiohead album. Everybody knows it’s The Bends. A child would probably tell you it’s OK Computer or Amnesiac. Trust me, it’s The Bends,”

“This is outrageous! A person’s choice in news outlet is supposed to reaffirm their opinions and prejudices, not challenge them. I’m taking this all the way to the Press Council, I’m lodging a complaint.”

But just before he shared his opinion to his Twitter echo chamber and Facebook followers, he paused to read the article.

It was then where the 42-year-old realised the folly of his ways.

“Oh my God,” he said.

“These are the results of a local poll conducted one afternoon on one street corner in the French Quarter. This poll doesn’t mean shit. This article is rubbish. The Betoota Advocate has gone downhill recently and they don’t even pretend they’re not run by rusted on socialists with an axe to grind!”

“Just goes to show you, sometimes headlines can be misleading. I mean, give me a break! Is Fake Plastic Trees better than Motion Picture Soundtrack? Maybe when you feel like you’re on fire and the world is caving in on you, granted. But Kid A is not the best Radiohead album.”

The Advocate can confirm that the poll used to write the article was conducted by an intern reporter with limited journalistic experience and that should be taken into account.

It is of the editorial staff’s opinion that Amnesiac is the best Radiohead album.

Couple Watches Shawshank Redemption Again After Failing To Decide On What To Watch

TEXT:

“Get busy living, or get busy dying,” said John McEnroe – moments after Nick Kyrgios defeated Willy Tsonga to progress deeper and deeper into the heart of tennis glory.

But after the broadcast ended, Marcia and Gresham Watson mutually agreed they weren’t tired enough to retire to bed.

Gresham then brought the Apple TV up on the screen and Marcia began to explain why she didn’t want to watch anything he proposed.

So rather than find himself suffering at the hands of Romy & Michele’s High School Reunion or The Hunger Games, Gresham threw himself under the bus and put Shawshank Redemption on – arguably the greatest story ever told.

“But we’ve already seen it like 50 times,” said Marcia.

“Seriously, I’ve already seen it twice this year. I know it’s your favourite but Jesus Christ! Can’t we watch The Danish Girl? You’d like it!”

But her argument was falling on deaf ears.

Gresham was already under the spell of master storyteller, Stephen King (who wrote the novella the movie is adapted from).

“You strike me as a particularly icy and remorseless man, Mr. Dufresne. It chills my blood just to look at you. By the power vested in me by the state of Maine, I hereby order you to serve two life sentences, back to back. One for each of your victims. So be it.”

Seconds later, Marcia let herself be taken by the film and resigned tot he fact that she’d be spending the next two hours experiencing powerful and timeless cinema.

“We should get the book,” she said.

“I’ve already read it, it’s fantastic. Do you know that movie ‘Stand By Me’ with those kids who find the dead body? Yeah well, Shawkshank and that movie are based off like shortish longish stories in the same anthology. Crazy? Huh?” said Gresham.

“Crazy,” said Marcia.

Locals Stage Boycott Of Pub They Never Visit After Mass-Produced Beer Is Taken Off Tap

TEXT:

It takes a lot for sheep and cattle farmers to put aside their differences and unite for the greater good.

On a national level, the fight for drought relief and market protections has brought them together in the past.

But today, on a more local level, locals from the Northern Lakes district on the Betoota City Limits have united to combat a vastly more serious issue.

The Hogget & Heifer, a popular watering hole for local farmers and graziers, has announced their intention to remove Betoota Bitter from their taps as the look to appeal to a different, trendier crowd.

Scores of local drinkers were shocked by the move at first, but that initial jolt of surprise has been replaced by furious anger – which has led to a boycott of the hotel by the regulars.

“It’s outrageous!” said Philip Tuckworth, a prime lamb producer and Border Leicester stud owner.

“We’ve been coming here for generations! There are photos of my family on the walls here. There’s photos of everybody’s family on the walls here. Taking Betoota Bitter off tap here is nothing short of cultural vandalism!”

“They do a great roast here each Sunday. But that’s beside the point. Boycott! Boycott!”

The Advocate reached out to the management of The Hogget & Heifer for comment and received a short statement in return.

Addressed to ‘whom it may concern,’ the letter outlined why Betoota Bitter was removed from the tap rotation.

“Betoota Bitter will still be available in cans, stubbies and flagons over the bar and in our drive-through bottle shop,” the statement said.

“However, we’ve decided to move in a new direction without tap beer. Our team is moving away from the mass-produced beers and looking to foster a closer relationship with our local breweries and producers.”

“We hope that our locals will return and end their boycott as we’re the only pub in the district. Locally produced lamb, beef and pork will still be served in the carvery. We hope we can put aside our differences for the greater good of the town.”

Zoo Patron Quietly Shitting Himself Posing For Photo With Local Orangutan

TEXT:

Her keepers say she’s harmless but Brett Galloway knows that orangutans have a dark side.

The 54-year-old initially said no to a photo opportunity with the great ape, citing that he wouldn’t go into the enclosure unarmed or alone.

But his family convinced him.

He spoke to reporters this afternoon about the ordeal and the associated terror that comes with fraternising with wild animals.

“That orangutan could’ve ripped my arms off if she wanted,” he said.

“It was utterly terrifying. Honestly. Now I know why Brett Lee and Glenn McGrath take such pleasure in shooting large game like gorillas, elephants and hippos. Being close to them is very scary. Anyway, it made my daughter laugh,”

“But yeah. I was shitting myself the whole time.”

The orangutan that Mr Galloway is referring to is, Shoehorn, a 21-year-old juvenile that zookeepers feel is quiet enough to mingle with patrons.

In 1996, the town was given the chance to name the new ape, which was the firstborn in the Simpson Desert.

Much to the disgust to the rest of the nation, the people of Betoota ultimately decided to call the orangutan, Shoehorn.

Never the less, when asked if he still had a good time at the Royal Zoological Park of Betoota, Galloway said yes.

“It’s impossible to have a bad time at the zoo,”

“But that doesn’t mean you let your guard down for a second.”

Walking into the office this morning, Jaysern Vukovic (37), was greeted by an unusually high number of judgmental scowls from his colleagues. Immediately thinking the worst, Jaysern looked down to see if he was exposing himself or had spilt coffee on his shirt, however, to Jaysern’s untrained and sartorially-starved eyes, he could see nothing wrong.

“Jays, don’t you have that new business meeting at 12?” question one concerned colleague.

“Yeah, pretty sure it’s still on, why’s that?”

“Oh, well, don’t you think you should have ironed your shirt? You know, good first impressions.”

The Advocate understands it was at this point that Jaysern educated his colleagues on his fool-proof de-wrinkling method.

“Haha what? Ironing? Are you kidding? I haven’t ironed a shirt in 10 years.”

“The trick is, you put the shirt on a bit wet, then it dries to your body shape”

“This bad-boy will iron itself out by 12, you’ll see” Jaysern proudly said.

The Advocate caught up with some of Jaysern’s colleagues, who were all too happy to throw the unhygienic and uncouth Jaysern under the bus.

“Oh my god, he’s fucking disgusting. I can’t bear to sit next to him. He drinks at least four Coke Zeros a day.”

“And he smokes, so whenever he has a ciggie he comes back in smelling like an ashtray – I get used to it but still”

“The un-ironed shirt is just another gross thing about him, you don’t know the half of it”

Following the choir of displeased colleagues, it seemed we did know the half of it. However, it’s hard to know whether it’s time that’s made Jaysern’s idiosyncrasies unbearable, or that he is, in fact, just a slob.

Stitch Claims Victory Over News Year’s Resolution For The Fourth Year Running

TEXT:

With the guilt of a two-month long pig out resting on his conscience, Mike Jung decided enough was enough and set himself a goal of getting fit.

The mildly-successful Betoota Ponds buyers agent downloaded the FatTwoFive app to his rapidly slowing iPhone 4 yesterday morning and visited his local Cucklete’s Foot to pick up some seemingly high-quality Nike runners.

Aside from the theatre and thrill of planning a running regime, the ramp of the landing craft slammed down on the beachhead around 6pm last night and Mike set off running into the distance.

Remembering to breathe out two strides, suck in for strides, he almost made it to the end of his block before his chest began to tighten.

“Two hundred metres, I think I got,” he said.

“Then yeah, I just knocked up real quick. Like it all came at once. It felt like the arteries in my neck were a pair of garden hoses on full blast. My mind went blank, all my thoughts and everything just went straight out the window,”

“My lungs burned and it felt like my nostrils were too small for the amount of air I needed. But the worst of all was the stitch. My God, it felt like I’d been stabbed! I’m committed to continuing on my journey from pub to five kays.”

Mike’s friends think otherwise.

One of his trivia buddies, who says he expects to see him tonight for the quiz, said that Mike is very impulsive and prone to explosive returns to cardio.

In other words, he’s seen this before.

“Last year he did the same thing,” he said.

“He’d go for a run or two then basically pack it in for some reason or another. He’d tell us why he can’t run anymore. I think it was more for him than it was for us,”

“I mean, we’ve all got our shit. I’ve got a $57 000 HECS debt but I’m not about to go out and get a second job. It plays on my mind a lot, however, I’m not telling everyone about it. Mike isn’t even that unfit, he just needs to quit smoking and drinking a Creaming Soda with every meal.”

Demolition Contractor Weighs Up Copper-Wire-To-Asbestos Ratio Before Accepting Job

TEXT:

Local demolition expert, Digby Schuster, has tentatively accepted to suss out a new gig at the now defunct South Betoota Ladies College – but he’s not gonna show up if it isn’t worth his time in cash payment, or copper.

While walking through the Queenslander-style stilted single-sex primary school today, Digby asks the boss if he has any idea when they built this piece of shit.

“Mid seventies I believe” says the foreman, Hutchie.

“Oh” says Digby.

“That’s a curveball”

The prominent demo contractor then spends the next 20 minutes poking up the corflute ceiling tiles with a broom and knocking on the plaster walls in each classroom.

“Hmmm. Might be a bit of a job on our hands” he says, indicating that the roof of this building might be full to the brim with James Hardie-era asbestos.

Without specifically saying it, Digby then goes onto explain that if the developers want ‘all the gunk’ in the roof dealt with properly, they can find someone else.

But, if they want it dealt with quickly, then he’s the man for the job. If they’ve got the coin.

“Mate I’m one of two demo guys on this edge of the Simpson desert” he says.

“And there’s a lot of holes in the desert”

“A lot problems can get solved in those holes”

“But we are gonna need a bit of money to dig those holes”

“And I get to keep all of the copper. All of the scraps. If those roof tiles come out tidy then I’m taking them with me too”

Hutchie then invites Digby out to the car park to have a yarn over a cigarette.

Graduate Lawyer Sick Of Being Asked For Legal Advice At Barbecues

TEXT:

“I’m so going to get you to defend me if I get done for DUI or something, how funny would that be?”

That’s the fourth time Alice Munro has been told that since she posed with her parents for a photograph out the front of the Queensland Supreme Court in Brisbane late last year, admission certificate in hand.

Even though she hopes to work exclusively in corporate law for a big six, many of her close friends plan to give her a ring should they fall on the wrong side of the blue line.

“For the first couple, I just kinda laughed and said, ‘Yeah sure!’ But I don’t want them to actually think I can help them. The only advice I could give them is to ring a local criminal lawyer and never talk to the police, ever,”

“But the questions keep coming. Dad asked me if I could help him sue your newspaper for damages after you published that article about his divorced sister preying on young stationhands at the Mooloolaba Surf Club,”

“I said no, Auntie CeCe actually does that – but it didn’t stop the questions.”

Over the weekend, the 23-year-old attended a family friend’s barbecue lunch with her parents and younger brother.

It was a Sunday and Alice had to be coaxed out of her room at 11am to get in the car despite going to bed just a few hours prior.

She told our reporters that being that sick from the grog had already put her in a mood and that the thought of spending the day talking to people didn’t help either.

“You might know something about this,” said her father’s friend, Gavin.

“My nephew Tom,”

Alice smiled and nodded because telling him that she didn’t would’ve prolonged the conversation.

“He was caught going to that music festival thing the other day at the South Betoota Polytechnic College with a lot of ecstasy tablets in his underpants. Police say it was a commercial quantity and that he’s in a real pickle.”

“Ah Ok,” said Alice before being interrupted.

“But Tom says the police didn’t get a warrant to search his person and that it was an illegal arrest.”

Though she wanted to tell Gavin that his nephew Tom is a ‘dumb cunt for dealing drugs and an even dumber cunt for trying to bring 240 pingas into a music festival in a ziplock bag’, Alice paused, thought about it, then told Gavin that Tom needs a good lawyer or else he’s going to prison.

“Wow! [laughs] That sounds terrible! I’d do and see a criminal lawyer in town. There are heaps if you Google them. I don’t know any because I’ve literally just finished uni and I’m struggling to even find a job, but I wish Tom good luck!”

Cousin From Out-Of-Town Forced To Use Bootleg Nintendo 64 Controller

TEXT:

In the ultimate act of disrespect, a South Betoota man has struggled to keep a straight face this afternoon after handing his visiting cousin a bootleg, nigh-on-unusable Nintendo 64 controller as the pair sat down to enjoy a quick game of Blast Corps before tea.

Levon Danko popped in from nearby Windorah earlier today and called in to see his cousin Robbie around 3pm this afternoon for a chat and a stubbie.

But as they hadn’t seen each other for a while, Levon ultimately decided to release himself to the evening by putting his keys away and helping himself to a second cold lager.

Recalling the good old days, as Millennials often do to pass the time, both Levon and Rick began to recall their Nintendo sessions that’d go on long into the night back when they were kids.

“I’ve still got it hooked up in the sunroom,” said Rick.

“Come on, I’ll play you in Blast Corps. I’ve been getting around it lately. Serious blast from the past it is. Oi, but yeah, you should stay the night. We’ll go to the pub for dinner and come home and get a bit stoned and take turns playing PilotWings. Remember that game?”

Levon just laughed and agreed.

But that’s where the joy ended – for one of them.

Rubbing the back his hand over the old CRT TV, feeling the crackle of the static electricity that built up on the glass on his skin, Levon picked up the sleek see-through genuine controller and handed Rick a bootleg one that should’ve never left the factory.

“Woah, steady on, mate,” said Rick.

“What the hell is this thing? How the fuck am I supposed to use this thing, you big quiche?”

“How do you hold it? Like what? Really? It feels like I’m cupping Mark Taylor’s balls!”

Levon urged Rick to listen to him.

“Mate, I use it all the time when Garth [older brother] is here. He makes me use it and I always school the bearded freak in GoldenEye with it. If I keep flogging you, we can swap, alright?”

As the afternoon continued into the sunset, Levon did, in fact, spend the time running rings around Rick.

He refused to swap controllers like he said.

Housemate Coming Home From The Pub Picks Up Broken Bread Maker He Found At Council Cleanup

TEXT:

With his fellow housemates at the forefront of his thoughts, a popular mortgage broker wandered home last night from the Pingouin Aveugle Bar & Grill in the French Quarter when he spied something he thought his friends would like.

As this morning was the first of four shire council cleanup services this year, the footpaths and roadsides of the fabled French Quarter were littered with everything from broken outdoor furniture to out-of-date white goods.

But one thing that caught Oliver Pigeon’s eye was a bread maker.

Though it looked like it’d been clipped by a few passing cars and was still damp to the touch after a midnight rainstorm, the 26-year-old thought it’d make a cracking addition to the countertop.

So with two bottles of Argentinian Malbec sloshing around inside of him, Pigeon decided to google a ‘bread recipe’ and pop it on so he and his housemates could enjoy fresh bread in the morning like rich people.

That’s when things went awry, says front bedroom sleeper Bill Thomas.

“We could hear him rooting around in the kitchen at like 2 this morning,” he said.

“Swearing and carrying on. Then we hear the mixer going and I just wrapped the pillow around my head and tried to get back to sleep. In hindsight, I probably should’ve got up and stopped the lunatic.”

According to Bill, young Pigeon had attempted to condense the time it takes to properly raise bread; opting to just pour the yeast, flour, salt and water straight into the visibly filthy bread maker and turn it on.

Minutes, not hours later, the kitchen filled with a rich blue smoke and Oliver could be heard swearing even louder in the kitchen.

Drawn in by the six smoke alarms now going off in the house, the residents converged on the kitchen to see what Oliver was doing.

“I’m sorry,” he said.

“I found a bread maker on the street and I thought we could use one – and I wanted you all to have fresh bread in the morning so I tried to make it work now but it’s just caught fire.”

It’s not the first time, says Thomas, that Oliver has brought home a white good from the neighborhood council cleanup.

Last quarter, the housemates woke up to half a living room set strewn across the front lawn. They made Pigeon get rid of it.

“We will be making him get rid of the bread maker as soon as possible,” he said.

“Unbelievable.”

Checkerboard Vans Lie Dormant In Local Rude Boy’s Closet Waiting For Next Ska Music Revival

TEXT:

Along with his 3-foot wallet chain and pork pie hat, a local rude boy’s slip-on checkerboard Vans have sat idle in his wardrobe for a number of years now – waiting for Ska music’s next inevitable revival.

It was 1999 and Western society was teetering on the edge of collapse.

The threat of communism was replaced by Y2K and the perennial evil of terrorism hadn’t yet changed the way we lived.

It was an environment that gave birth to the third wave a ska, which had its rise in 1950’s Jamaica followed by a second almost a decade and a half later in the United Kingdom.

But it wasn’t until US bands such as Reel Big Fish, The Mighty Mighty Bosstones and Smash Mouth brought it the movement into the living rooms and concert halls around the world in the 1990’s.

One local fan of the movement, who cast the gloomy shackles of grunge music to the wayside, is Peter McCauley.

Now a 40-year-old senior product manager at The Good Guys South Betoota, Peter spoke to The Advocate about his halcyon days bobbing his head to the groove and crumping his can to the beat.

“I’ve still got all the stuff, all the fashions that went with the movement and all the CDs,” he said.

“My checkerboard Vans and wallet chain. The Hawaiian shirts, so many of them. A few trilbys and a pork pie hat. Oh God, I remember having these thick-rimmed glasses that I didn’t even need. Plus a few pairs of SMP three-quarter-length cargo pants. Those were the days, now I might as well be walkin’ on the sun.”

When asked by our reporter why he still hangs onto these things, whether they be for a sense of nostalgia or otherwise, McCauley said he didn’t throw anything out because he’s waiting for Ska music to come back into vogue.

“Ska will rise again. Trust me. And when that day comes, I’ll have all four windows down in my wife’s Volvo softroader and the Ska will be blaring as the warm desert winds make what’s left of my hair dance gently,” he said.

“But until then, I can’t wear this stuff. It’s too ridiculous and my boss would probably tell me to go home and get changed. Other than that, sometimes I go to the pub dressed in my old rude boy get-up. I reckon the next revival is about a year or two off.”

In-Depth Study Confirms Kings Of Leon And The Killers Are The Same Band

TEXT:

The music industry is reeling today from the findings of a decade-long study into two of it’s biggest names.

For many years now, many insiders have long suspected US rock bands Kings of Leon and The Killers are actually the same band.

Earlier this afternoon, the music industry’s peak scientific body, PitchGronk, published the controversial study into the super groups and since then, representatives for the two acts have gone into damage control.

Speaking candidly to The Advocate about the shocking revelations, local rock journalist enthusiast Ross Stone, who’s also in a band so his opinion is valid, said he and the rest of his colleagues were shocked.

“The evidence, in hindsight, is quite clear,” he said.

“They’ve never played at the same festival, although I expect somebody on the internet to prove me wrong and leave a comment on the article but I don’t care about that, that’s not important,”

“What is important is that these bastards need to be made accountable for this. They’ve misled and lied to so many people. How would you feel if Ringo Starr came out and said he played drums on all the Monkee’s studio tracks? You’d be angry, just like I am now. The first dance at my wedding with my wife was to Sex on Fire! I’m heartbroken!”

The Advocate reached out to the Mr Brightside hitmaker’s management for comment but have yet to receive a reply.

However, the Nashville-based Kings Of Leon emphatically denied any wrongdoing on their part in a short statement to the media this afternoon.

“We are not The Killers,” they wrote.

“But Keith Urban actually plays rhythm guitar for us and for that, we’re sorry for not telling our fans sooner.”

Graphic Designer Outraged As Foam On Flat White Technically Makes It A Latte

TEXT:

Betoota’s trendy French Quarter has been the sight of an audible tantrum today as local graphic designer Marcus Marigold (34) received a flat white with just enough foam that he believed he’d instead been served a latte.

The resulting tantrum took place at approximately 8:30 am in the ‘Wolf & Brew Haberdashery’ with witnesses describing Marigold’s reaction as outraged and desperate.

“He was blowing up,” said one onlooker.

“Acting like he’d burnt the Sunday roast dinner or something. Screaming that that leg of lamb was jet black and hard as quartz. We were all like, ‘it’s just a coffee, and it’s Summer mate, eat a lamb chop, and get over it Calm your farm,’ but he wouldn’t have a word of it,”

Sources have confirmed that after a small disruption, Marigold promised to use his social media influence to give the cafe a 1-star review on the Face Book, ensuring he would highlight what he believes to be a ‘haphazard opinion on what constitutes a flat white.’

Wolf & Brew Haberdashery have responded to Marigold’s outburst and 1-star review stating they believe Marigold’s flat white was topped with a very thin level of foam but not enough to be considered a latte.

In his 1-star review Marigold denies this was the case:

“Seriously, if I had added chocolate to that it would have been a damn mugachino. I’m a graphic designer alright, I know what coffee is.”

Barista on duty at the time, Lucas Binns, says the more surprising thing for him was not Marigold’s outburst but his choice of drink.

“What graphic designer orders a flat white? Normally they go for a piccolo or a coffee blacker than their vacant humour. Think he’s just a bit of a whinger to be honest.”

While admitting he may have overreacted, Marigold says this kind of oversight is one that shouldn’t be made by a business that claims their coffee ‘artisanal’ and ‘perfectly brewed to perfection.’

“Of course it’s important. I’d have gone to Soul Origin if I didn’t give a shit about foam levels,”

“And yeah, I was a bit grumpy, but sorry honey, I hadn’t exactly had my morning coffee yet.”

Suburban Cricket Stoner Finally Takes Opposition’s Advice And Gets A Fucken Haircut

TEXT:

“Get a haircut c-nt” was the phrase still ringing through Marcus Harrison’s head this morning as he trundled down to his local barber.

After being berated for an entire Saturday by a middle aged father of 3, Harrison decided that maybe it was time he cut his hair.

“Yeah, standing in the baking sun fielding all day is often shit enough as it is, let alone having to deal with some comedian sitting in the shade playing the same insult on repeat,” he said.

“Get a haircut mate. Oi cunt how bout you get a haircut [ha ha ha]. I reckon he spat that shit like that out 7 or 8 times when I was fielding and then another 3 or 4 during my well constructed innings of 17.”

Harrison told us that he was confused as to why in 2018, a young man like himself who was studying at university in the Betoota was lambasted for having long hair.

“It’s not like I am hippie from the 70’s who lives on a commune and grows organic vegetables to pass the time. It’s just shit banter from an old fella who hasn’t got much else to live for I reckon.”

“Anyway long story short, having to listen to sub standard sledging like that each week is annoying, but I actually did need a haircut. So yeah I’m not doing this because some Darryl gave me shit ok.”

Kid At Wedding Has Had Enough

TEXT:

A small child spoke freely with The Advocate yesterday during a local wedding, saying he’d had enough and wanted to go home.

Sam Allison (9) told our reporter, who was also present at the wedding, that he’d been up since the ‘early morning’ and was beginning to get fed up with the whole thing.

“I’m so bored and tired,” he said.

“And these shoes are uncomfy and so is this tie. I don’t even know these people getting married. Dad didn’t let me bring my DS and he also won’t let me play on his phone. Mum has been drinking all day and makes me talk to her friends whenever she sees me so I’ve been hiding from her,”

“I want to go home.”

Our reporters at the scene were able to verify and corroborate young Sam’s version of the story.

His father, Glenn, said that he doesn’t like the idea of using an electronic device to amuse a child when they should be ‘running amok’ like kids did in his day.

And Sam’s mother, who asked not to be named, said that her son should ‘go play with the other kids or something’ instead of complaining and whining.

“We will leave the wedding when my wife wants to, not Sam, unfortunately,” said Glenn.

“Look, I’m in the same boat as Sam. I want to go but it’s my wife’s cousin’s wedding so I think we’re here for some time yet. I’m going to get Sam a Fanta or something to pep him up a bit. He’ll make it.”

“Day For It”: Man Takes To Social Media To Say The Weather Conducive To Drinking Alcohol

TEXT:

A resident of the leafy, exclusive enclave of Betoota Grove has confirmed to his 700 Instagram followers that today is definitely a day for it.

Will St Germaine (26), a French Quarter real estate agent, has amassed a strong following on the app thanks to his constant confirmations of whether it is or is not a day for it.

Though the qualities of a “day for it” are somewhat vague, research has found a strong connection between ‘days for it’ and summer weather.

“Today’s an absolute beaut, it’s going to be a scorcher,” Will told The Advocate.

“Yeah, it’s definitely the day for it,” he added.

Will, a keen stand-up-paddleboarder and Coroner drinker, says he originally began using the phrase to let his friends know whether the fish were biting down at the yacht club boat ramp.

“If I don’t catch anything, I don’t bother posting anything, but if I do, brother, I have to let the boys know,” he said.

Though, he acknowledges the phrase can also be reworked to fit any occasion.

“If it’s like 35 and sunny, and you know the boys would be keen for some arvo bevs [sic] at the Dolphins Club, I’d definitely chuck up a post saying it was the day for it.”

Tractor Sufficiently Bogged Enough To Warrant Getting Dad Involved

TEXT:

Try as the might, the Inter is bogged.

Rather than face the ultimate humiliation and get Dad to come and help you, two local brothers attempted to save face today and get Big Red out of a bog by themselves – but both of them knew their efforts were futile.

After a few scuds passed through the area in the past few days, one of Walter Pearson’s bore drains has become especially sticky.

So much so, it caught his sons, Sam (13) and Dylan (15), in its web.

Speaking to The Advocate a short time ago, Dylan said they knew they were in trouble from the get-go.

“Dad got us to take the chisel plough up to the lucerne paddocks and come back and get the flatbed but we got bogged on the way back,” said Dylan.

“We went through the bore drain a bit further up the paddock and we almost got stuck going through it up there so I thought I’d try further down here. The ground looked hard enough but I guess I just broke through it,”

“When we realised we were going anyway, we tried to dig ourselves out and fill the ruts with sticks and leaves but we were going to get out without a tow.”

And so started the two-hour walk home from the bogged tractor to the homestead, which is only a mile off Rural Route 6 on the Betoota City Limits.

Just as the house came into view, they saw the lights of their father’s HZJ75 cruiser come over the crest of the hill.

“Where have you two been all day?” asked Walter as he pulled up.

“Did you boys get bogged on the drain?”

They both pursed their lips and nodded.

“OK, jump in the back. We’ll go and get the Massey.”

Sam and Dylan went into the shed to fetch a length of good chain and followed their father on the Massey out to the bogged Inter.

Moments later, the tractor was free again and they all made it home in time for tea.

Concerned Onlookers Relieved To Discover Person Driving On Footpath Isn’t Drunk – He’s Just 89

TEXT:

Earlier today, a late model Nissan was spotted driving erratically down Peanut Street in Betoota Heights.

Onlookers were concerned, the car was all over the road and many fellow motorists phoned through their concerns to police.

However, upon catching up to the car, a local man was relieved to discover that a drunk wasn’t behind the wheel.

It was Harold St Clare, a popular pensioner and long-time resident of the Anglican Retirement Village on Stevens Road.

As police arrived on the scene, a seemingly ambivalent Harold said he didn’t know what all the fuss was about.

“I just came down to the shops to do some shopping and have my prescriptions filled,” he said to traffic police.

“Why? Is there a problem with my automobile?”

After being told that they’d had reports of him driving quite dangerously, Harold dismissed them and explained that there must’ve been a misunderstanding.

He was quick to remind the probationary constable that he flew a Spitfire in the war and has five Messerschmitts and a Fokke Wolfe to his name.

The concerns of the police for Harold’s driving weren’t echoed by the onlookers, who said they felt at ease knowing it wasn’t some criminal on his way home from the pub, but an upstanding and respectable member of society.

“When we saw it was just an old man driving on the footpath, we were so relieved,” said one witness.

“Everybody thought it was a drink-driver. People who do that should have their hands chopped off I say. Make them drive with their teeth! Anyway, we all love Harold. So funny to see him almost run six people over. Such a character!”

Local American Hopes He Can Wear His Flag Shirt With Pride Again One Day

TEXT:

For over a year, Steele Fightmaster’s favourite American flag button-up has hung in the corner of his walk-in wardrobe in Betoota Grove untouched.

Arriving in the Desert Capital four years ago for work, the 34-year-old said that ever since ‘you-know-what’ happened in 2016, he’s felt embarrassed about being outwardly American.

Even though he works in oil exploration, has no qualms with exploiting the Earth’s natural beauty for sheer profit, the final straw he says came earlier this week.

“Every country is like a human being,” he said.

“They all have shitholes. Australia is full of shitholes just the same as Denmark is. Take it from this man-of-the-world, there’s some outrageous shitholes in Denmark. America, per capita, has a lot of shit holes. Trust me. I’m originally from Oklahoma,”

“Anyway, I used to enjoy throwing on the Stars and Bars of a warm summers night. Head down to the Dolphins Club or the Royal and have a few cold beers and boogie. Hell, I even used to ‘yeehaw’ if I felt like it. Instead of clapping politely at football games, I’d shout and holler, scream and stamp my feet. Whistle obnoxiously loud, turn my hat backward and flip off the opposing team’s supporters,”

“Nowadays, I just clap and smile like every other white middle-class bougie piece of shit like me in this fucking postcode, I swear to Christ, man. It’s killing me. Fuck, one time I even said I was Canadian. I hope one day I can be proud of being American again.”

When asked if he’d still feel the same if a celebrity was elected President in 2020, Steele kind of laughed and smiled. Then it looked like he was about to cry so our reporter let himself out.

Boomer Who Hasn’t Watched A Game Of Tennis Since This Time Last Year Has Strong Opinions On Nick Kyrgios

TEXT:

Though most of his mate’s down at the Cashew & Pogostick Inn in Betoota Heights would describe him as ‘spirited’, those who know him best just say he’s an angry man.

Nobody knows what Johan Prescott is angry about, they just know he is.

The 61-year-old explained to The Advocate today that aside from all that, he’s looking forward to this year’s Australian Tennis Open which is due to start in the coming days.

Which is why the semi-retired estate agent has a bee under his bonnet this morning – he read somewhere that Nick Kyrgios, arguably the nation’s most talented tennis player, is a red-hot chance of making it deep this year.

“I was so offended, so angry that I stormed out of the house, walked down to the newsagent, bought The Australian with a $50 just so I could have MY opinions on this matter reaffirmed,” he said.

“It’s not up for discussion. Nick Kyrgios doesn’t deserve to make it to the quarterfinals! If he does, I will so fucking livid. He needs an attitude transplant. If only Pat Rafter or Double-L Lleyton had half his talent, they’d still be walking over that kneeless Swissman to this day!”

“All that counts is that my opinion is correct but I ain’t spending any time on it.”

When Mr Prescott declared himself a ‘tennis expert’ during the interview, his eldest son George cough laughed and got up to help himself to a cold cordial from the fridge.

Shortly before our reporter left the Prescott home, The Advocate spoke briefly to George about his Old Man’s racquet and ball smarts.

“He hasn’t watched a game of tennis since last year’s Australian Open,” he said.

“The bloke can’t even pronounce Roland Garros properly. Anyway, tennis always gets him worked up,”

“I blame the media for fanning the flames. He pretty much listens to whatever a shock jock says and then parrots it back to everyone without even thinking about what he’s saying. When I make it, when I make it big, I’ll move as far as I can away from this desert and never come back.”

Sadist Finds Pleasure In Shaking Towel Up Wind Of Other Beachgoers

TEXT:

Deciding to cool off today at Betoota’s lesser-known waterparks, the old Mansfield Quarry, Betoota Heights man, Jason Pane (32), experienced what can only be described as the most inconsiderate and sadistic act known to any beach loving Australian — shaking one’s towel near other beachgoers.

The old Mansfield Quarry was opened to Betootanese people from all walks of life last year after the Shire Council had 40 tonnes of pristine white sand trucked in from Southbank, on Brisbane’s trendy southside.

For Jason, it wasn’t just the hundreds of loose disintegrated rocks and shells that blew into his eyes and mouth that shocked him, it was the fact that the person in question did it repeatedly — despite the less than subtle passive aggressive comments coming from Jason and the rest of his party.

“Oh yeah, no worries mate, just chuck sand all over me,”

According to Jason, this first comment was largely ineffective, because within another 15 seconds another sandstorm hit.

“Are you fucking serious?” spat Jason, loud enough for his friends to hear, but not for the offender.

The Advocate caught up with Des Capote, a lifeguard at Quarry, who informed us that the number sand-in-eye cases has increased dramatically in recent years, as a result of the Quarry becoming a popular alternative to the now completely gentrified areas surrounding the Betoota Sailing Club.

“Yeah, people reckon you’ve got to worry about yabbies latching onto a toe but in my opinion, it’s these people who just don’t know basic beach etiquette that you really need to monitor.”

With population growth and migration an inevitable part of life, it seems, albeit unfortunate, that we will be seeing a lot more of these types of cases in the future.

Doofus Feels He’s Making Inroads With His Girlfriend’s Cat

TEXT:

A happy-go-lucky Betoota Grove roofer has broken his silence over the ongoing problems he’s been experiencing with his girlfriend’s cat.

Miles Helm, who turned 28 just a few days ago, told our reporters that whenever he drops into Lucy Beetlecough’s two-bedroom townhouse down in the French Quarter, her cat never seems enthused.

Helm and Beetlecough have been an item for some time now.

Some say it’s been 6 months while others say they’ve been going at it on and off for years.

Putting that to one side, Lucy got a cat this time last year because she’s an adult and wanted one.

Everything was going fine, according to Miles, until he started staying the night at Lucy’s place.

“I’d try and softly kick the cat off the bed during the night,” he said.

“Look, it’s not that I hate cats. I don’t, I just don’t want to touch them or sleep with the bastards on me. Anyway, her cat’s name is Brett and Brett is a real cunt of a cat. Mate, I’m telling you. He’s out to get me,”

“Whenever I go up or down the stairs, the little shit weaves between my legs. If I step on him, he’s got every right to bite me – and he fucking knows it. Any trespass against little Bretto and he’s on me like poo on a shoe. I’m trying my best to be mates with him and I think it’s working.”

Working indeed if you ask Lucy, which our reporter did moments after talking to Miles.

The popular nurse said that Brett and Miles get along fine, that they’re two men in her life that she loves having around.

“I’ve seen them cuddle up before on the couch, Brett loves getting the base of his tail scratched! Miles really scratches hard and Bretty just starts seizing up and pulling these funny faces, it’s so cute! Argh!”

“Why? Has Miles told you something different? MILES! Honey, what did you tell the reporter about Brett?”

“Yeah see, Miles loves him.”

Suburban Teen Still Shook After Listening To ‘Dance With The Devil’ Yesterday

TEXT:

In what started out as a seemingly innocent bong session under his parent’s humble Betoota Heights Queenslander, a local teenager’s chop up has ended on a rather sad and pensive note.

Still shook from hearing Immortal Technique’s 2001 horrorcore rap ballad, ‘Dance With The Devil’, Stan Sandisk said he was at first shocked and horrified at the tracks content yesterday afternoon – but now he’s just saddened by it.

“So heavy, bro,” he said.

“My mate’s older brother Greg, he’s the one that keeps hooning around Betoota Ponds in that red Nissan, he was like, ‘Hey boys, want to hear the most fucked up song you will ever hear? Pass the AUX cord you little bitch and pack yourself a romper, get ready,’ and then we were all like sure, whatever,”

“And then he plays the track, I’m basically on the verge of greening out hard, which would’ve been heaps scat in hindsight – and we were all like it’s not that bad,”

“Then the ending and the whole thing about kidnapping that poor woman. These guys are animals. Why do people glorify them? They should be in prison!”

Even after a hazy but restorative night’s sleep, he couldn’t get the images out of his head, nor the song’s lyrics.

The Advocate reached out to a number of local parents regarding their children’s exposure to such graphic content.

Colin Sandisk, Stan’s upper-middle-class father with enough time on his hands to worry about the music his son is listening to, spoke to our reporters regarding songs such as ‘Dance With The Devil’ and others.

“Why can’t kids listen to good music, like Bob Dylan or The Eagles?” he said.

“Like back in my day. Sure, we had communism and AIDS to worry about but they certainly didn’t inspire such filth. I’ve given these songs a listen to, these ones that have ‘shook’ my son into a deep period of introspection,”

“They make it seem cool and OK to commit violent crime and to do drugs. My son would never do drugs but you never know with these types of influences around them.”

Canceling Plans To Sleep, Do Nothing Found To Be The Best Plan Of All

TEXT:

Do you ever feel like doing nothing?

So do a lot of other people, according to a recent government study which has found that abandoning plans at the last minute to relax and do nothing is actually the best plan after all.

One outspoken member of the local Do Nothing Club is Sascha Stevens, a civil engineer specialising in concrete, told The Advocate that she often doesn’t feel like doing anything after work – but often has to force herself to stick to plans made previously.

Albeit rarely, the 26-year-old says she enjoys canceling plans so she can relax but likes to find a happy medium so she doesn’t appear to be flakey.

“Coming up with an excuse is the hardest part,” she said.

“After that, it’s a piece of piss. There’s nothing better than lying down on the couch after a long day and feeling your spine decompress. It’s even better when you know you’d be doing something else. Something that I wouldn’t enjoy,”

“Like last Thursday. I met this guy for a drink and listened to him talk about himself for an hour until I said I had an emergency at home to attend to. I also live alone, which is worth the extra money. There’s not much else I like better than to just be alone doing nothing, recommend it 100% to anyone.”

Authors of the study, the CSIRO, have come out in defense of those people often described as ‘flakey’ and ‘unreliable’ by saying ‘don’t knock it until you try it’.

Local Cryptopreneur About To Learn What Capital Gains Tax Is

TEXT:

Glenn Brooker is a cryptocowboy that rides upon a bullish Litecoin steed, which he plans to hold for the time being.

But aside from his ‘blue chip’ coins, the 29-year-old smart man also enjoys diversifying his portfolio – and risk – by taking punts on smaller coins.

One of those smaller coins mooned, real hard.

As of the January 5,  the Betoota Grove resident’s initial $500 investment in Verge is now worth a whopping $3.89m.

“I thought it mooned so many times,” he said.

“Once, I tried to sell it and it didn’t go through but then it went up again. Then when it mooned again, and I held it again, it went even higher,”

“So I thought, fuck it. That’s my mortgage paid off and I can invest the rest. So fucked. Crypto is really letting this younger generation get some financial power back. Boomers hate it because they don’t understand it.”

However, after paying a round of extortionate fees to get it back into regular currency, the 28-year-old is not facing another issue.

The Australian Tax Office.

As the large sum landed back into his account, he did what every financially literate person does.

He paid his debts, cleared the credit card and called his friends over for one hell of a celebration.

Unbeknown to the cryptopreneur, this large sum of money entering his account raised some flags with the authorities.

The bank also froze his account.

“So I got off the phone with the bank and the tax office just before,” he said.

“They said I owe them almost $2m is capital gains tax. What the hell is that? I thought the banks and government couldn’t touch crypto? This is bullshit. Blockchain isn’t an asset! Fuck! My Dad was right!”

“I went to speak with my accountant and he said either pay your taxes or learn how to fight because I’ll be having a gap year in Wacol prison if I don’t,”

“Do you get to keep the money if you go to prison and make it out alive?”

“Hallelujah”: Quick Google Search Uncovers PDF Version Of $340 Textbook

TEXT:

Internet piracy is frowned upon at South Betoota Polytechnic College but one student doesn’t care.

Lewis Cartwright, a second-year law student at the college, just discovered an online, pirated version of a textbook he needed next semester and he doesn’t feel at all bad about it.

“Hallelujah,” she said softly to himself in the library, pronouncing the silent ‘J’ as well.

“That textbook is like $300 or something. Fuck yeah. What? What was that question? Nah [laughs] I couldn’t give a fuck about the author or the publisher. Asking for $300 for a 300 page textbook should be illegal,”

“Now that everybody from the federal government to parents are attacking students, we need every win we can get.”

Not content with being the Jack Sparrow of intellectual piracy, the 21-year-old went onto his cohort’s Facebook group for the course and shared a DropBox link to the textbook.

His classmates thanked him and some even offered to pay him, the thief.

But that’s raised eyebrows at the campus Co-Op bookstore, which has ordered several copies of the textbook which nobody is now going to buy.

Classes resume at the end of next week and there’s still 15 unsold copies of “Law Of Torts: An Introduction Into High-Functioning Alcoholism” left on the shelf.

“Something’s going on here,” says the man who works there.

“I think they might be pirating the book. Students these days have no respect. Their professor worked long and hard to write that textbook and his students continually steal and pirate it. Do they think people work for free?”

“Every year we have to torch 90% of the copies during the Sir Joh Memorial Book Burn and it breaks his heart.”

Mate Who Barely Uses Facebook Somehow Never Misses A Party

TEXT:

It’s not that Gregory Ball doesn’t like using social media, he just finds himself doing other things most of the time.

Rather than fiddle with his phone during the long commute to his job at the Betoota Sailing Club, the popular bartender opts to play on his beloved Nintendo DS.

When he gets a moment to himself, such as at smoko or afternoon tea, he somehow just stands there and thinks about things and people.

The 25-year-old electrician seems to do anything but scroll through a timeline or shoot somebody a like.

“It doesn’t entertain me that much, not as much as other things,” he said.

“Like, I’ve got the accounts and so on, but yeah. I don’t really use it that much. Maybe like once a week? Like maybe to just see what everybody’s up to and stuff? But, ah, yeah. Not a big user of The Face Book,”

“When I get a moment, I like to think about things. Like this funny thing my housemate did the other day. You had to be there, man. Sometimes I think about my girlfriend and other times I think about pets I saw on the way to work. Today I saw a nice Border Collie called Brett. His coat was so soft.”

Many of Greg’s friends understand that when they invite him to a party or gathering on the Face Book, there’s a good chance he won’t see it for weeks.

Which is why they deploy a tactic once previously exclusive to older generations.

They ring and tell him.

“I never miss a party or anything,” he said.

“Only if I’m sick or something. Then maybe I’d consider staying at home and keeping warm plus hydrated. But yeah, if the guys are going to the pub or something like that. They call me. If there’s a birthday party on or something, they call me and ask if I’m going. No qualms from this old party horse,”

“But I do use WhatsApp and stuff, I’m not a cave man.”

Office Intern Sweating On Whether Or Not 1st Round Of Arvo Drinks Were On Company Card

TEXT:

A young office intern whose financial situation can be described as a bit touch-and-go is currently exhibiting the psychological occurence known as fight-or-flight.

The fight-or-flight response, also known as the acute stress response, refers to a human reaction that occurs in the presence of something that is terrifying, either mentally or physically.

Andrew Alderely (20) sits in silence, nodding along to random pub conversations as his mind races through different hypotheticals surrounding the beers placed in front of him. Did his acting manager pay for them himself? Or did this one get thrown on the company card.

Andrew worries that Sarah, his senior and go-to supervisor at the West Betoota-based events company who has never given him much reason to think his personal life is something she considers on a day-to-day basis, might have paid for this round on her card – which means he is expected to wear the cost of six craft beers on his own savings account at some point this afternoon.

“I literally don’t have a plan B if my card declines” he says to reporters, before discreetly attempting to log into his netbank app without anyone noticing.

“Like, there’s no back up. I don’t know anyone here well enough to explain my situation, and they care so little about me that they couldn’t possibly realise I might be struggling on an unpaid internship while living in a sharehouse in town.”

As Andrew wonders to himself whether or not the old GE Creditline card he used to use at University in his office is still valid, and worth anything, the young entry-level social media and community organiser is absolutely shaken by an off-the-cuff comment made by Sarah.

“They don’t miss you at this pub. I think each one of those beers costed something like $9 bucks” she says, without any indication of whether or not it was actually her that paid for it.

At time of press, Andrew was on his phone enquiring about whether or not he would be able to get a Nimble loan approved in the next 15 minutes.

Gold-Toothed Concreter Makes Uncomfortable Joke About Burying People Alive Under Slab

TEXT:

A dodgy contractor has sent chills down even the hardest tradesmen’s spine this afternoon, following a dicey joke about killing people.

The self-employed career concreter by the name of Ernie Margolis cackles to himself with a proper gold tooth glistening in the sun, after insinuating that he has engaged in buried bound and gagged victim of organised crime or personal vendetta.

In fact, Ernie follows up his joke by suggesting he’s actually killed more than one person.

After an initial smoko conversation about how the severe heat was making his job harder, as the concrete was setting faster than usual, Ernie refers to the concrete slab in front of him as both the livelihood and bane of his existence.

“These fucking things cause me so much shit. I don’t know why I fucking put up with them [laughter]”

The rest of the site joins in on the chuckling, before Ernie shows his true colours.

“I shouldn’t laugh too much. A lot of my problems have been solved under those slabs”

Everyone goes a bit quieter except for a few equally as dodgy bikie-affiliated labourers who laugh even harder.

“Loooots of problems” says Ernie, as to emphasise how much of psychopathic criminal he is.

A young apprentice drops his water bottle out of confusion and nervousness, before Ernie and the dodgy bikies break into laughter again. Ernie assures the young bloke that he needn’t worry about drowning to death face-down in a thick layer of wet cement.

“Don’t worry young fella. Wouldn’t let a handsome bloke like you disappear on site [laughter]”

“You’d be a quite popular in the pen”

Impossible Achieved As Nation Somehow Begins To Feel Sorry For Stuart Broad

TEXT:

Though many Australians refuse to admit it, millions of everyday people have admitted today that they feel sorry for English cricketer Stuart Broad.

Aside from a five-wicket haul in Melbourne, the nation’s most European city, the 31-year-old has not had much luck with the Kookaburra.

But as every Australian enjoys seeing successful people fail spectacularly, Broad has captured a unique sense of melancholy with people as he’s staring down the barrel of a horror series end in Sydney this weekend.

Speaking to The Advocate a short moment ago via wireless telephone, Gregory Marshall of Grosse Point in East Betoota, said he does feel bad for Stuart Broad but stopped short of saying the Australians should take their boot off his throat.

“He’s a great bowler,” he said.

“And he’s got a win-or-die attitude, which most Australians hate but also respect. It was funny in the first three Tests, seeing this floppy-haired prick get carted around the ground by our tailenders even, but as things have progressed, it’s just plain sad right now,”

“I feel for the bloke. It’d be hard to deal with. But in saying that, it’s fucking glorious. It’s hilarious to see English people get beaten in sport. There is simply nothing better. Which makes me think. Can we buy back Eddie Jones now?”

The Advocate reached out to the English Cricket Team on the Twitter for comment but have yet to receive a reply.

Cruise Ship Passengers Looking Forward To Experiencing Gastro

TEXT:

A senior Betoota Grove couple has spent this past week keeping their fluids up because they’re about to board the Pacific Pearl, a popular cruise ship in the South Pacific.

Glenda and Colin Masseman have told The Advocate this afternoon that they look forward to experiencing everything the ‘cruise life’ brings, including a shocking bout of gastro.

The sexagenarian Cancerians have also expressed interest in seeing Fiji.

“We hope the experience of having gastro together will allow us to grow closer as a couple,” they said.

“Watching your partner shit their brains out while they softly cry and moan with your own eyes is very confronting. Raw humanity. we simply cannot wait,”

“Hopefully we’ll also get to see and experience some culture on our holiday as well.”

However, it’s not the first time Colin will run afoul with a cruise ship.

In 1978, he was banned from P&O Cruiselines for the rest of his natural life for public defecation and attempted piracy.

A misunderstanding, according to the plastic bedsheet owner.

“Part of this holiday is to put that part of myself out to pasture,” he said.

“Like that Stevie Nicks song, Wild Heart, or something like that. You know, la la la blame it on muh wild heart! Sha na na na, you know the song. Here, I’ll get it up on my phone.”

“Ah, I can’t seem to do it. But yeah, you know what I mean. This cruise will be quite cathartic for me.”

Glenda nods in agreement.

“Yes, it will be nice to get away from this stinking desert for a week or two,” she said.

“But if we don’t get to experience gastro, which every cruise ship passenger seems to these days, I won’t be that disappointed,”

“I want to see that vine bungee jumping they do in Vanuatu. So brave but also quite irresponsible.”

City Worker Treats Himself To A Hard-Earned Beer After Gruelling Four Days In The Office

TEXT:

While the rest of his coworkers are still galavanting up and down the coastline, one brave junior portfolio manager has braved the fierce coalface of the sharemarket this week – alone.

Darcy Robuck, a 25-year-old trader at bespoke local private asset management firm, Madden & Fellatio, told our reporters that he deserves the beer he’s currently sipping on down at the Cashew & Pogostick Hotel in Betoota’s fabled Old City District more than others he’s sipped on.

He took time out of his busy afternoon of watching cricket and inhaling pints to talk to our reporter.

“Mate, it’s been hectic,” he said.

“All the medical marijuana stocks have gone apeshit this week and the phone’s been ringing off the damn hook,”

“Been trading all day, mate. I’ve had to run some down to the Betoota Stock Exchange on foot even. Like back in the 90s, it was great. Anyway, I’m fucked, mate. Can I get you a beer? Nah, come on! What are ya drinking? It’s fucking 2pm on a Friday, nobody in the financial industry is at work right now. Have a beer with me!”

And with that, our reporter filed this story from the disabled toilet of the Cashew & Pogostick, telling our editorial team that he was done for the day.

There’s a box on his desk waiting for him because unlike the share market, the news doesn’t knock off and go to the pub.

Steady Increase In Social Media Tagging An Indication New Romance Is Going Well

TEXT:

For Jack Coffey (28), the bravest thing he did in December 2017 was to tag Tessa Blumenthal (25) in a short online video of a dog drinking water from its bowl. A seemingly innocuous gesture to most, but for Tessa, and her eagle-eyed best friend Joanne, it meant that Jack was totally into her.

What started off as a bi-weekly back and forth between Jack and Tessa, steadily increased to an ongoing daily tag-a-thon – which, in today’s digital society, is a clear indication that the two are very much romantically involved.

The Advocate caught up with best friend, Joanne, to confirm the status of the two Betootanese lovers a month into the romance, to confirm whether their online relationship had in fact translated to the real world.

“Omg [sic] they’re totally a thing, well, nearly”

“They’ve been on one real date, Jack paid, so cute, I died!”

“I reckon that two other friends, Lindsay and Sarah, have got a thing going on as well. I don’t have proof, but I’ve been monitoring their tagging and something is definitely happening”

The Advocate reached out to Jack and Tessa, and Lindsay and Sarah, to confirm whether or not they’re indeed romantically involved, but we’re yet to receive a response – which is odd because their constant tagging would suggest that they’ve definitely been online.

Bloke Slapping Hand Against Himself Feels He’s Contributing To Applause

TEXT:

Watching his local cricket team coast to yet another victory late this afternoon, a popular grazier had a beer in one hand when the side’s star batsman pull another short ball to the boundary.

Many of those around Steve Gumble felt compelled to applaud the batsman’s skill and ability, which they did by putting their hands together politely.

But with a can of easy drinking Betoota Bitter in one hand, the 57-year-old found himself awkwardly unable to clap.

So rather than attempt to hold the tin between his legs while he clapped loudly, without whooping or hollering like a boorish American or an ABC live studio audience, Steve began to vigorously slap on his left thigh.

“Great shot!” he said firmly, not loudly.

“Well done, Mike!”

But some have told The Advocate that if one cannot clap properly, then one must not ‘clap’ at all.

An overly observant and largely annoying fellow cricket fan shared with our reporter that Mr Gumble should’ve not bothered slapping himself in applause.

He should’ve put his drink down, then clapped.

However, when we spoke to the sheep breeder himself, he explained that he was contributing to the applause – despite what anyone else says.

“It’s making noise, isn’t it?” he said.

“I’m showing my appreciation by making noise. Point out the cunt who said I should’ve kept quiet!”

“I’ll fucking kill him!”

Study Finds Majority Of New Years Eve Celebrations To Be Held Around One Of These Cultural Icons

TEXT:

Found in over 60% of Betootanese backyards, the eponymous ‘kick-on table’ as it’s known in the local vernacular, is bracing itself once again for another party.

The residents of 63 Morrison Road in the leafy, exclusive enclave of Betoota Grove, have told our reporters that their outdoor setting is going to be getting a workout tonight – much to the chagrin of the table itself.

Dane Peterson, who was dumb enough to put his name on the lease of the sharehouse, spoke to The Advocate a short time ago before most of his guests arrived.

“That table has seen a lot of bad things, it’s heard a lot of shit talk and outright gibberish,” he said.

“In fact, I don’t think there’d be a glass outdoor setting like mine that hasn’t been on the receiving end of something similar. They’ve each been privy to the most embarrassing, cringe-worthy conversations ever had,”

“But that won’t stop us from doing it again. That’s what they’re there for. Back when we used to smoke in the house like pigs, the table used to get a bit of a reprieve. Not anymore. This isn’t France, we have a little bit of self-respect for home.”

Never the less, Mr Paterson’s glass outdoor setting is accompanied by a spa this year – which has made his humble abode the place to be among his friends.

Shortly before our reporter left the Morrison Road address, a handful of friends turned up with more than enough beer in clear bottles to sink the HMAS Canberra (III) twice over.

As he had more work to do in the office this afternoon, our reporter politely declined an offer to get in the spa and take the top off a few XXXX Summers.

“New Year, New Me!” Says Woman Who’ll Be Buying Durries At 2 AM Tomorrow

A local woman is convinced that 2018 is going to be her year, despite the fact that she’ll change absolutely nothing about her behaviour or the decisions she regularly makes.

Tessa Phillips, 29, is hoping that midnight on New Year’s Eve will mark a new start for her, and she plans on celebrating the exact same way she’s celebrated her last 8 new starts – a pack of smokes and a finger of Absolut Pear vodka.

“It’s been a bit of a tough year”, said Ms. Phillips in a statement. “I lost my job, had to move back in with my parents, and my health has been described by doctors as ‘technically the same as a 95 year old asthmatic’ – But I can feel 2018 is really going to be my year, you know?”

“I mean, it’s a brand new start! None of the decisions I made in 2017 will matter anymore! It’ll be like I’ve never smoked in my life, instead of a pack a day for the last 12 years!”

Ms. Phillips is confident that all she needs to live her best life is for the clock to strike 12 on New Year’s, instead of making any meaningful long-term changes to her actions or how she makes decisions.

“People keep saying to me things like ‘stop smoking’ or ‘stop taking drugs’ or ‘maybe you should go to work this month’. But why would I do that when I can just wait for 2018 and then just have, like, a really good year? That seems way easier!”

Ms. Phillips has also planned for the “incredibly low” chance that nothing actually changes next year and she ends up having a horror 2018.

“Its simple, I’ll just wait for New Year’s!”

Man Unsure He’ll Ever Be Able To Jump In A Pool Again Without Flash Of Anxiety About iPhone

A man who knows for a fact that he doesn’t have his iPhone in his pocket, has still checked his pockets after diving into the pool.

Despite never having actually unwittingly jumped into a pool with his phone since the Snake II days, local man Bretty Johnson (30) says it is now human nature to check his pockets after a pencil dive.

“It’s instinct mate” he says with a sigh.

“Gone are the days where I can just jump into a pool without a care in the world. Those things [iPhone] cost more than my first car did”

Bretty says that even after watching himself put his phone on charge minutes ago, he still doesn’t trust his own eyeballs, and cannot help but check his pockets both before and after jumping in the pool.

“I reckon I would still do it even if I jumped in naked” he says.

“I triple checked my pockets and actively made the decision to go in the pool in my smugglers so I wouldn’t have to worry – but I did it anyway. It feels a lot like paranoia”

“so effectively all I’ve done is run my hands over the bare skin where my pockets usually are”

“And what’s the point of checking after anyway”

Early this morning, The Advocate received a letter from a local reader currently holidaying in Fiji.

Though he took the time to explain just how great the Pacific nation is this time of year and whatnot, he was quick to the point and didn’t mince any words.

The subject of the letter was in relation to a recent article.

Asking to remain anonymous, our editorial team respected his wishes in that regard but the contents of the letter were simply too topical and important to relegate to the archive folder.

We received the message as below:

Hello Betoota Advocate,

I have been wondering this for a while but I’m not sure anybody can give me the correct answer besides your editors or whoever reads these fucking messages.

Are you cunts fucking illiterate?

Seriously. There’s a spelling mistaje [sic] in every single article.

I thoroughly enjoy your work and respect you both as writers and journalists but surely you’re taking the piss when it comes to proofreading your work?

Sometimes I don’t even click on an article because I know it will have a mistake in it. Boys, it shits me to tears. I’m one of those people who can’t stand that shit.

For the love of God, please proofread your articles!

Merry Christmas and Happy New Year you fucking mouthbreathers. Go and get fucked.

Your Friend,

As for a formal response, The Advocate and its owners would like to make it known that we as an organisation stand behind our proof-reader.

Their adult children are on board with Mum and have tried to pry their father away from his brothers, even though it looks like he’s enjoying himself for the first time in months.

The unrenovated French Quarter terrace his family has called home for a generation has resisted the growing tide of gentrification – but they can’t hold out forever.

“My brother inherited this house from my parents, who arrived here from Cyprus many moons ago. I was only a child. We enjoy catching up and talking. We eat and drink in celebration,”

“Betoota has been good to my family. But my family, yeesh! They carry on! My Marcia, my beloved, has been trying to rush me all day. She wants to go home. The kids, they keep playing on their phones, no grandchildren. I blame Scott Morrison! Make houses cheaper, you God Squad freak!”

Shortly before Christos lost his temper, he told his family he’d catch a cab home.

Cash From Grandma Will Always Be Most Practical Gift Local Man Will Ever Receive

There are many practical things Greg Toad would’ve liked to have received this morning from Santa.

Perhaps an electric toothbrush or a ten-pack of socks.

Even a bag of lollies from the chemist would’ve been enough.

But put all those things aside, the most important and useful gift the 28-year-old will ever receive for Christmas comes in the form of a yellow banknote.

“She knows me too well Grandma does,” said Mr Toad.

“Grandma knows my needs. She understands that I don’t need new shirts or clothes, there’s the internet for that. I don’t need a gift voucher to Dymocks or Borders, she knows I’m barely literate as is,”

“The quickest way to my heart is through cold hard cash. I love my Grandma.”

As for what Toad plans to spend the $50 on remains a mystery.

He did, however, hint and where and when he might part ways with the ill-earned dosh.

“I might slide it into a workman’s piano down at the Dolphins Club tomorrow night. The place goes off on Boxing Day.”

Rural Firies Draw Straws Over Who Has To Put On The Fucking Santa Suit

TEXT:

You know you’ve got a tough job when you can spend the twilight hours of a Sunday morning rushing into a burning building to save a morbidly obese grannie and her water colours, but according to the West Bedourie fire service it’s not the worst part of the gig”

All of the domestic disputes they’ve had to resolve while attempting to stop an entire house from burning down, all the cute little kittens and puppies they couldn’t save, all of the gorgeous heritage listed Queenslanders they’ve seen burn to the ground – nothing is quite as bad as being paraded through town on the top of the truck dressed as Santa.

“It’s a tough one” says Antony Beveridge, one of the senior firefighters in the Diamantina area.

“No one wants this gig. It’s forty degrees out here and the council wants us putting on a full body woollen suit with a pillow under the top”

“I don’t why the fuck this doesn’t fall into the cops responsibilities, or the road workers, they are all much fatter than us”

With the town’s children now lining the streets to see Santa randomly appear on the top of a fire truck, Beveridge says there’s a nice community element to it, but it’s still something he won’t do without being made to.

“I guess it’s not the worse thing you can do while on the job”

“But I did it last year so fuck that”

“Yeah This Bracelet Looks Nice” Reckons Boyfriend In Market For Last Minute Gift

TEXT:

Local man Liam Williams has fucked up again.

A young plumber and boyfriend has once again waited until Christmas Eve to purchase his girlfriend of 6 years a present.

“I promised myself for the last month or so, that I would really put some effort in and get Sally a nice personal gift that she will love,” he told The Advocate.

“But I have shat the bed again. I don’t know. Girls are so hard to shop for. Looks like it’s gonna be Michael Hill bracelet from me. She said if I got her another Pandora charm, she’d leave me.”

Sally Alcorn, who many of Liam’s friends have confirmed is far to good for him, assured us that she was, in fact, expecting something pretty generic for Christmas.

“Yeah, he is pretty useless. I enjoy spending time getting him stuff that he will love and enjoy. Last year I made up a pack of great things that he loved,” she said.

“But poor Liam. He is a typical boy. So unorganised. It’s actually a little bit heartbreaking when he hands the little gift to me. He always has this face on him like a little boy in trouble.”

Standing in the bustling uber-commercial jewelry store in the Quarter Mall, Williams told our reporters that he hopes by spending a lot of money on the piece of jewelry he may get some brownie points.

“I can just try and drop in down the track that it cost a few hundred dollars to make her feel like special.”

Dad Answers Question With 10min Explanation When A Simple Yes/No Would Suffice

TEXT:

The town’s leading historian, Nigel Walker (65), couldn’t contain his excitement this morning when his youngest son, Dilan (18), asked him if Budapest was the capital of Hungary.

Dilan, who is off on his gap year in March, was after a simple yes or no answer, however, Nigel took this opportunity to educate his young son on the city’s etymology.

“Well, Dil, Budapest is in fact two cities, Buda and Pest, the two are divided by the river Danube – it was only in 1873 that the two cities became what we now know as Budapest” Nigel eagerly explained.

Dilan, who did not care about Budapest’s history, stared blankly at his father.

“So… Is it the capital or not?”

Nigel, oblivious to Dilan’s bored and vacant expression, launched into yet another passionate monologue recalling a time he and Dilan’s mother were in Budapest.

“Your mother and I went to Budapest you know? Back in 1984, your mother was pretty loose back then –”

“Dad!” Protested Dilan, now desperate to end the conversation.

“For fuck sake, just tell me if it’s the capital or not.”

“Oh, yes, it is.”

What started out as a simple father-son discussion ended in both parties leaving with a sour taste in their mouths.

Bloke Prepares Himself For Annual Christmas Eve Fight Down At The Bottom Pub

TEXT:

There will be many sore heads tomorrow across town but not all of them will be from the grog.

Returning back to his parents block on the edge of town, former-private-school-pupil-turned-university-student Martin Wilson-Carter told The Advocate that while he’d prefer not to fight anyone on Christmas Eve, he knows it’s inevitable.

Riley’s Casino And Grill, better known as the bottom pub in South Betoota, is where many of the locality’s south traditionally congregate on the night before Christmas to catch up and share a drink.

However, one thing often leads to another and police often attend the popular venue at some point during the evening.

“It’ll be nice to see all my old friends from primary school and whatnot,” said Martin.

“But, you know, I don’t want to have to punch the fuck out of them, either. But if they start shit, I’ll fucking finish it. Look, it all starts nice enough. People are backslapping each other, laughing and carrying on,”

“As the sun goes down, though. People change. The level of intoxication in the room builds up. Old grudges from yesteryear start to come to the surface and people get resentful and jealous of other people’s successes and privilege in life,”

“But after the punch-up is over, we all makeup and forget about it for another year.”

Speaking to The Advocate about the unavoidable melee at Riley’s tonight, owner Sam Pouchman said that he has ‘quite a high tolerance for horseplay’ but he draws the line at beating someone into unconsciousness.

He recalls an incident last year where a fight broke out between the farmers and the townies, which resulted in half the block being declared a crime scene.

“It all started with one thing,” he said.

“A local auto electrician looked a cattle farmer up and down then called him a, ‘brown boot fuck’ and then it was on for young and old,”

“Before long, scores of Toyota Lo-Luxs turned up packed to the loading board with townsfolk and the primary producers found themselves outnumbered. They fought a running battle down Lawrence Street, there was ripped strippy shirts and cuffed Cubans all up and down the footpath. One townsperson had the Fox Racing sticker peeled off the back windscreen of his ute. It was bad.”

“I hope for the love of God nobody dies this year.”

Local Biscuit Enthusiast Thoughtfully Leaves Orange Creams For Someone Else

TEXT:

“It’s not like I don’t like them, it’s just that they’re my least favourite biscuit in the tray,” he said.

“And I know I’m not the only one who doesn’t really like Orange Creams. They’re always the last ones left.”

Cameron Pilliga is referring the orange cream variety biscuit found in an Arnott’s Assorted Creams, a staple of any respectable tea room in the country.

Though it’s far more popular than it’s peasant cousin, Family Assorted, the collection of creme biscuits has been the centre of a fierce and spirited debate between biscuit enthusiasts like Pilliga.

But one thing that the 29-year-old can agree on is that he often leaves the Orange Creams for somebody else to enjoy.

“I feel a bit piggish if I hoover up a whole cream tray in one sitting,” said the sweet-toothed Sagittarius.

“So leaving the grotty orange creams to go stale and soft in the tray is a good way of making it seem like you haven’t had as many biscuits as you have,”

“Then sometimes, especially after an episode of Scrubs with a sad ending, I’ll find myself back at the tray pushing those softening stale biscuits down my throat with a glass of cold milk.”

Pilliga refused to comment further on how he became to be known as a local biscuit enthusiast but said it should be ‘pretty self-explanatory’.

Premade Airport Sandwich Somehow The Worst But Most Expensive Sandwich Local Man Has Ever Had

TEXT:

Despite owning a three-piece suit, one local salesman claims to have enough taste to enjoy the finer things in life.

Sam Willett, of Montague Street in Betoota Grove, explained candidly to The Advocate that he loves curling up on the couch with a glass of red and watching some foreign cinema.

He even drives a Citroen.

Part of the year, he lives in Melbourne, which is where he left from this morning on his way back to the Desert Capital.

However, he told our reporters that he did plan on eating anything but the pain of mild hunger got the best of him.

“I had the worst sandwich I’ve ever had in my life,” he said.

“And it cost $11.90. A bottle of water to wash it down was a flat five. Who the fuck are these people? How do they get away with this?”

“Do not tell me it’s a problem with the rents. There are so many uppity dickheads who won’t even read this but will tell you airport food is expensive because of the rent. Does it look like I care? I care about not getting ripped off when I come to the airport.”

The shop where Sam purchased the transit delicacy was ambiguously named, The Brunch Spot, which only further upset him.

New Study Attempts To Understand What Type Of Human Drinks Southern Comfort

TEXT:

People first noticed Gary Turtledick wasn’t normal in high school.

He’d routinely mouth off at teachers, even as a relative youngster.

As a sixth form student, his fellow students frequently observed him using a urinal with his school trousers down around his ankles in a pool of somebody else’s piss.

In a word, Gary was weird.

Which is why now, as a creepy but ultimately likable 30-something, Turtledick unwinds after work with a few Southern Comforts.

Now a new study into people like Gary has been launched by Australia’s peak scientific body, the CSIRO, which has the aim of understanding what type of person enjoys drinking the liquor.

Albeit brief and ultimately quite odd, Gary spoke to The Advocate a short time ago.

“It’s a real quencher,” he said.

“Pour it over crushed ice and add lemonade. Simply unbeatable after a long day of breaking shit up and throwing it into a skip bin.”

However, he concedes that he has to often repeat himself at the bar. Not many bartenders are familiar with the term, ‘SoCo and lemonade’, according to Gary.

Those sentiments were echoed by other patrons at the Hinch’s New Liver Inn on Alambie Road in South Betoota.

They’ve observed this creature named Gary for a number of years now and they’ve all learned to give him a wide berth.

“That cunt is not right in the brain,” said local drinker Sam Frog.

“He is weird. You know what’s the weirdest thing about him?”

“He drinks South Comfort and he likes it.”

The study is set to be published towards the next of this year.

Paralegal Binging On Double Blacks About To Find Out Why She Stopped Drinking Them

TEXT:

Heading to a party in the French Quarter this evening Sara Milad, a 22-year-old legal graduate decided to make a spontaneous purchase of a notorious alcopop.

The generally composed young woman exited the bottle shop in The Quarter Mall with 3 4packs of Double Blacks today.

Its pretty well known around the nation that people often only drink Double Blacks for one reason.

To get substantially intoxicated, potentially inebriated, usually at a house party.

Double Blacks contain 1.9 standard drinks per can and are popular amongst female teenagers for their high alcohol content.

You won’t see many people quaintly sipping a double black while enjoying a nice meal for example.

“Why not, I’m gonna have a good night” she laughed pushing aside her better judgement, and understanding that drinking double blacks almost always ends in incapacitation.

She told The Advocate that she just had a moment of nostalgia, when standing in front of the fridge and went with it.

Milad acknowledged that she will most likely be reliving her youth tonight, hugging the porcelain at the house party, or later that night at home, after the double blacks get the best of her one more time.

“I just get so excited sometimes. And if I am drinking the old Smirnoff Ices, it probably could be a very dangerous mix.”

“I wonder if my dad will come and pick me up before midnight and mum will hold my hair back while I disseminate the contents of my stomach into the toilet like the good old times?”

Beach Town Tourist Overwhelmed By Choices At Local Takeaway Shop

“I’m looking at the works burger,” he said.

“With chips and few calamari rings. And a potato scallop. Oh wait, I didn’t see the beef and black bean roll.”

Vince Greenpoint of Betoota Grove, arrived in Mooloolaba earlier this week for nine days of switch off with his young family.

Married to Grace Greenpoint, her folks just over in nearby Buderim, making the beachside town on Australia’s answer to the Amalfi Coast the natural choice for a holiday this year – again.

Aside from the time spent horizontal and the hours spent feeding lobsters into Pelican Pete’s bill down at the Surf Club, Vince said he’s keen to experience other great things Mooloolaba has to offer the casual tourist such as him.

But that’s all on hold for the moment.

Around lunchtime, Vince, Grace and the kids flip-flopped their way into a local takeaway shop keen to sample some of the local cuisines.

“Jesus,” he said.

“Honey, what are you thinking?”

Grace looked up at the menu, paused, then said she wasn’t hungry.

“Suit yourself. I might need a minute here, I’m a bit overwhelmed with choice here.”

“Just make sure to get the kids something,” said Grace.

“No soft drinks, either.”

After 5 minutes looking up at the menu, Vince ultimately left with enough food to feed his family for a day and struggled to break a twenty.

He then watched Grace eat most of his chips as they sat in the park beside the beach and watched the waves crash on the sandbar.

Tailender Plays Another Majestic Straight Drive Through Third And Fourth Slip

False confidence is a trait that can often be found in cricketers.

It’s far more prevalent in park cricketers than footballers, soccer players and pretty much any athletes other than boxers.

The epitome of bravado and self-belief was displayed this weekend after local lower order Betootan batsman Pavel Vasiliev edge one through the slips.

Immediately after, he told his batting partner that he was “seeing them like beach balls today.”

Vasiliev’s partner Toby Mueller said he gave Vasiliev a nod of approval, despite knowing full well that the ball was supposed to go somewhere a solid 170 degrees in the other direction.

Vasiliev confirmed that he blocked out the chorus of loud “Awwwwww’s” from the opposition as the ball streaked to down to the boundary.

“I just walked down the pitch. Padded a little crack here and there and walked back to my crease. I guided that ball through the gap. 4 runs is 4 runs blokes.”

Mueller, however, claims it was pretty obvious to all those watching that Vasiliev wanted that ball to go back past bowler.

“Yeah a few balls later the ball rocketed into his pads and he was gone. He was not seeing them like like he claims he was,” said Mueller.

Vasiliev denies the allegations though and claims that it was a real shame that he got out because he was feeling extremely comfortable and probably would have gone on with the job.

Cashed-Up Tourist’s Inability To Reverse With Trailer Brings Joy To Locals

TEXT:

“Left hand down, mate,” he yelled from the jetty.

“Yeah keep going. Nah go back up and straighten out, mate. Yeah, woo! Now come down slower.”

Nat Wilmott is trying to keep the peace down at the Betoota Sailing Club boat ramp – but he’s having a little bit of trouble.

The line this morning was nearing ten trailers and a sunburnt Betoota Grove financier was trying and failing spectacularly to launch his boat into Lake Yamma Yamma.

In the dry desert heat, people were getting frustrated.

But not everyone.

Those not in the line, the jetty fisherman and the like, we’re all laughing at the expense of Peter Mantis, a somewhat likable private fund manager at Macquarie Private Wealth in the French Quarter.

“Mate, you’re fucking useless!” screamed one bloke from beside the boat ramp.

“Do you want me to do it, mate? I’ve never driven a Merc before, but. Is the big silver cunt an auto or what?”

But that was when Nat, the owner-operator of the Betoota Sailing Club Tackle Shop, stepped in to help.

Peter had fallen into the trap of boat ownership without first thinking to master the art of reversing down a boat ramp – something he regrets now.

“It looks easy enough, to reverse a trailer, but it’s not,” said Peter.

“Then this nice old man, Nathan I think his name was, coached me through it and I ultimately got the thing in the water,”

“The whole episode certainly entertained these South Betoota mouthbreathers. Leering at me from the edge of the boat ramp.”

Local Dad Teaches Son How To Pull Uncle Mark’s Short Balls Ahead Of Christmas Match

TEXT:

“Roll your wrists, Joey,” he said.

“Keep your head over the ball, don’t be scared to watch it onto the bat.”

This afternoon, Joey Murchison and his father Mike spent a few hours running through tactics and the like ahead of the planned Christmas Day match against his brother Mark’s family.

One important aspect they covered was Uncle Mark’s merciless around-the-wicket right-arm short balls.

Last year, Mark hit his 11-year-old niece in the grill when she stood up to a nasty bouncer.

Even though Mike took that as a rare opportunity to publically beat his adult brother into mild unconsciousness like it was 1982 all over again, he wants his kids to be prepared.

“If his family is losing, he’ll do it again,” said the Betoota Heights builder.

“And when he does, I want my kids to have the confidence to stand up to the bastard and pull him viciously along the Sir Walter to the bamboo boundary,”

“Because fuck Mark. My daughter Marcy isn’t scared of him anymore. My wife’d beat him about the head with the Kookaburra if she could get away with it. This is what Christmas is all about, enjoying the company of your family while you rip old scabs off.”

Speaking to our reporter shortly after training concluded, Joey said he’s ready for whatever Uncle Mark throws at him.

“I’ve been watching Steve Smith this summer, he’s pretty good and I’ve been trying to copy some of his shots,” said Joey.

“Also, when I’m bowling, Dad told me to walk up to Uncle Mark and tell him to get ready for a broken fucken [sic] arm. I can’t wait to do that. I’m ready.”

Man Starting On Rums At Christmas Party Under Impression He’ll Be There All Night

TEXT:

Andy Thompson may have been a little bit naive to think that he was in this year’s Chrissy party for the long haul, after starting his evening on the rums.

The employee at the Betoota Ponds Harvey Norman said he was really looking forward to the shindig, with his colleagues but admits he got a little carried away.

Fellow workmate Colin Harper told The Advocate that the recipe for disaster was fairly obvious from the outset.

“He was like a bull in a china shop when he came in.”

“He tried to gee myself and Umesh, within minutes of walking in the door.”

“Come on lads, let’s have a rumbo and coke aye, come one. May as well. Works paying aye. Come on.”

Harper said he resisted the pressure to skull his beer, and Thompson waddled off to the bar saying that he (Thompson) and Umesh were a couple “of soft cocks.”

After knocking back numerous Inner Circles and cokes like a frat house teen pumping jelly shots, Thompson began making a nuisance of himself.

“He ended up putting one of the young fellas who works during the school holidays in a headlock and had to be escorted out of the venue by security,” said Harper.

Thompson was reportedly yelling apologies for the fact that he was just trying to show everyone a good time as he was shown the door.

“It’s all a bit of a blur really mate,” Thompson said to us.

“I don’t know, yeah maybe I did get a bit carried away, but it’s the silly season and at the end of the day I was just trying to make the night a bit of a fun aye. Can’t blame a bloke for trying.”

Roosters Relocate Headquarters To Bermuda In Effort To Stay Under Salary Cap

TEXT:

From Bondi to Bermuda, it’s a move that could shock the NRL to its core.

The Sydney Roosters have announced that they are planning on relocating their headquarters to the small North Atlantic Island of Bermuda.

It comes after the Sydney Roosters landed another big name signing in Angus Crichton and many in the sporting world were left wondering how long before the club came down in flames.

Phillip Olivio who works as the Head of Accounting at the Roosters explained that this whole salary cap thing can be worked around with a little bit of smart bookkeeping.

“The trick is not to go and do dumb shit like giving players boats and that like they did down in Melbourne,” he said.

We asked Olivio whether the whole Parramatta Eels saga made then jump before they were pushed.  

“Haha did you see what they were getting up to in Parra. They were putting these Third Party Agreements on napkins and then giving the boys cash…… Jesus Christ. Even if we stayed we wouldn’t be doing basic stuff like that.”

“You gotta play smart boys. We are off to The British Territory of Bermuda so we don’t get caught for rorting this thing. That way we can get ourselves a 2000’s Melbourne Storm team that’s actually on the books,” he said.  

Olivio said that fans don’t have to worry, there will be no name changes or anything of the like, only a change of backdoor process to sign good players.

Betoota Rugby League Club is in crisis control this morning after their 3rd-grade captain was detained in a conservative western region overnight.

The club told  The Advocate  that the Dolphins were on an end of season tour over in the west and that the player, who was unable to talk at the time, was identified by the club’s budgy smugglers

Fellow 3rd Grade teammate Toby Hampton spoke to our Perth based reporter in their hostel a short time ago and said that the incident hadn’t dampened the spirits of the other 20 blokes on tour.

“Ha ha ha, that was so good. You should have seen it,” said Hampton while looking at his iPhone with one eye closed.

Hampton said he wasn’t to concerned about Williams getting locked up.

“To be honest fella, it’s probably the best thing for him, best thing for us. The last day or so has been close to getting outta hand, and with him in the can it means we’ve been humbled a bit”

Williams’ girlfriend Ashley failed to return our calls but is reportedly fuming at the arrest after learning that her husband was in Perth and not helping his mum move house on the Gold Coast.

Bureau Of Meteorology Breaks With Protocol And Correctly Forecasts Weather

TEXT:

Popular state-run weather service, the Bureau Of Meteorology, has broken with the usual modus operandi and successful forecast the weather today.

Early this morning, the Bureau boldly claimed in their smartphone application that the temperature at 12pm today would be 41℃ in the shade.

Lo and behold, it is.

“I can’t believe it,” said Dennis French, curator of the fern enclosure at the Royal Betoota Botanical Gardens.

“My ferns are very sensitive to temperature changes and I have to adjust the greenhouse to the outside ambient temperature accordingly. Usually, it’s all over the shop but today, the Bureau has been bang on the money,”

“I hope they make a habit of correctly forecasting the weather. I feel like I’m cheating a partner when I look at WeatherZone.”

The impressive return to form comes as the government agency correctly forecasted rain earlier this year.

Down to the hour, says one local grazier, telling The Advocate that when he checked the internet for the rain forecast in June this year, they told him to expect it at 2pm on the dot.

“I was blown away,” said Juan Generro, a South Betoota alpaca farmer.

“When it said to batten down the hatches come 2pm, I knew I had time to head out on the four-wheeler and check waters and whatnot, then at 2, the rain came down,”

New Juicer Already On The Shelf

TEXT:

As Paul Keating famously said during a speech to the UN back in 1993, Australia is so rich that everyone will own a juicer at some point in their lives.

Today, his vision for the future has almost become a reality.

However, in a report commissioned by the Australian Council Of Juice and Juicers [ACJJ], it’s become apparent that this great Australian dream of juicer ownership is now turning into a nightmare.

Each Christmas, the tradition of gifting juicers has resulted in tumbling rates in which they’re used.

Almost 90% are tragically used once before being dumped in the back of a pantry or cupboard.

“It makes for disturbing reading,” said ACJJ chairperson Meredith Dalton.

“We make these juicers to bring joy into the lives of everyday people. Except, the report says they rarely do anymore. They just get in the way in today’s world,”

“It’s sad nobody has the time anymore to make their own juice. And from what I understand, cleaning the machine is a serious pain in the arse. That could have something to do with it. The report failed to answer many questions, it only made me sad.”

The Advocate spoke to a number of local juicer owners, many of which decided against going on the record against the large and powerful juicer lobby.

One brave soul picked the gauntlet up that our reporters threw down.

Danny Broche, an arguably-employed bartender that works nights, explained candidly to The Advocate that his morning regime often includes making his own juice.

“They’re right,” he said.

“A juicer can be a real bitch to clean. Have you ever put a mango through a juicer? There’s more hair at the bottom of it than Gary Sweet’s shower drain! But you simply can’t purchase the freshness and quality in store,”

“I was born a juiceman and I’ll die a juiceman. Tonight we juice, tomorrow we sip.”

Local Dog Clearly Not Enjoying Run As Much As The Owner Is

TEXT:

A popular local dog has revealed to The Advocate this afternoon that though he looks like he’s enjoying himself when he’s taken for a run – he doesn’t actually like it that much.

Bruce, a 10-year-old male canine of mix appearance, told our reporters that some days he just feels like taking it easy.

“There are so many things I want to do while I’m out and about,” he said with the help of a local dog translator.

“Like investigate a smell here, try to eat something I shouldn’t there. My life is a carnival but not when I’m being dragged through the French Quarter by my neck. There are times, granted, when I’d like to go for a bit of a burn and really go for top speed,”

“But I’m like 70-years-old in your universe. How many half-deaf and half-blind septuagenarian humans do you see get dragged by their throat up Grosvenor Road? Fucking none that’s how many.”

None the less, when our reporters finally caught up with Geraldine Douge, Bruce’s owner, to ask her if she thinks Bruce still likes going for runs, she said yes.

While Mrs Douge concedes that Bruce might be getting on a bit, she said that doesn’t mean his exercise regime should suffer.

“I don’t want him to get overweight and put stress on his back and hips,” she said.

A fair point.

“I used to take him down to the weir at the Grove Street Gardens for a swim, which’d be better for his hips, but all the geese down there are so territorial and unwilling to share the space,”

“They hiss and snap at Bruce. Then when I go to shoo them away, the bastards they turn on me!”

Many of the pub’s patrons have voiced their disgust at the proposed sale, telling The Advocate that Hemmes is a ‘pub wrecker’ and that ‘all the Betoota Grove yuppies’ will end up destroying the hotel’s soul, even though it hasn’t had an operating kitchen in eight years.

During a night of drinking with a group that has been described as “The Boys,” Kelly, after allegedly ingesting 21 bottles of Hahn Super Dry, revealed to his friends that it has been 23 months and 12 days since he last had sex.

Witness and housemate of Kelly, Ernie Snook (32), confirms this story and says despite what Kelly’s cool tattoos may suggest, his housemate’s lack of sexual activity makes perfect sense.

“While it may look like he’s always had a recent kiss on the neck from a mysterious woman who uses a vivid red lipstick, Dicko never actually brings any ladies home.”

Despite the confirmation by various sources, much of the Betoota township is in denial about Richard’s lacklustre performance with members of the opposite sex.

“Richard? Nah he gets some. Have you seen his tat?”

“No way! So anyone is allowed to get that tattoo regardless of how much sex you get?”

“Wait is that a tattoo? I thought he was already getting laid! Don’t tell me that’s a lie too!”

Not surprised however are many of the women of Betoota, such as Green Grocer Lindsay McShane (28), who claims Kelly’s attempt to hit on her at work made it obvious his neck tattoo was not based on any real-world experiences.

“He bought half a dozen eggs and then asked me ‘How do you like your eggs in the morning? Fertilised.’ I actually spewed and he still kept trying to ask me out.”

According to Kelly, the fact his ever-growing dry spell is now common knowledge is just a small setback, and he still has a variety of tattoos that provide him with novel enjoyment.

“I’ve also got ‘Your Name’ tattooed on my ass? Don’t believe me? Wanna bet?”

Backwards Hat A Firm Indication Local Man Reckons He Must Be Pretty Good At Touch Footy

TEXT:

It has been confirmed today that Phil Thomas reckons he is pretty fucking good at touch footy.

“Yeah I go alright champ,” he told The Advocate.

The local accountant in The French Quarter laces on the boots every Monday night to light up his social mixed touch comp.

The ex-Dolphins reserve grade winger rates himself as a speedster, a bit of a playmaker and a game breaker.

Thomas’ perception of himself is typified by the religious wearing of a backwards cap every time he plays the game.

“Man it’s just like to keep the sweet and hair and stuff like out of my face. And to be frank with you, it makes me feel way more dangerous,” he said.

Local Human Affairs Expert at the Betoota Social Anthropology Association, Simon Watson, confirmed that people who wear caps backwards during sport are of the belief that they are very good at touch footy.

“I think it stems from footage during the news of professional athletes training with hats on backwards.”

“However, understandably they do it because they may be running in the sun during the hottest part of the day for up to two hours. They aren’t playing mixed social touch in a temperate climate under lights for 20-25 minutes.”

Watson said that there is always one gimp who has to rock the backwards facing cap in a team.

“It’s very common actually. It’s usually worn by the guy who was never much good at sport and is insecure about numerous facets of his life.”

Man With Flat Phone Lies And Says He’ll Transfer Money For The Uber

TEXT:

As the night was coming to a close at the Dolphins Leagues Club in South Betoota, two toey humans decided the night wasn’t over for them – they had to keep drinking.

As the popular nightspot is quite isolated, Larry Pidgeon and Brett Frog decided to call an Uber.

Except Larry, a 24-year-old local diesel fitter, was in possession of a flat phone. Meaning he couldn’t split the fare or contribute and monies toward the trip.

He turned to Brett and said he’d transfer him half the cost but both of them knew he was lying.

Ignoring the time-honoured tradition of simply buying the man a drink upon arriving at their next destination, which turned out to be the iconic DNA Bin Nightclub in the French Quarter, Brett explained that he’d rather just send him the money.

“It’s easier if everyone gets their own drinks, that way you can monitor your alcohol intake much better,” said lying Frog.

“I’m going to transfer Larry the money in the money when my phone’s charged. It’s not convenient but neither if life sometimes.”

According to Pidgeon, this isn’t the first time Brett has tried to pull a fast one on him.

Though it’s debatable, Larry reckons Brett’s phone is always flat when it comes to riding in an Uber.

“Cunt thinks I’m stupid,” he said, well within earshot of our reporter’s young daughter.

“He won’t transfer me anything – and if he does, the description will be very inappropriate. When I applied to get a mortgage two years ago, Brett transferred me money for ‘ketamine’ and my bank manager looked at me like I was a common junkie,”

“Anyway, last night was fun. Vomited on the bus to work this morning. Right now this man’s back. Sometimes life is inconvenient.”

Female Law Grad Applies For Capsicum Spray Permit Ahead Of Work Christmas Party

TEXT:

Sarah Harris likes to let her hair down. She likes to enjoy a drink. She likes to have a good time. She likes it when work picks up the bill, to thank her for working 10-12 hour days all year for the firm.

However, more than all of these things – Sarah likes to feel safe. So ahead of the work Christmas party, Sarah has applied for her permit to carry Capsicum Spray. Just so she can enjoy both things.

Section 7 of the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998 states that it is an offence to possess or use a prohibited weapon unless authorised with a permit. Permits authorise the use of a prohibited weapon for sporting, training or instructing purposes, or for educational, historical or commemorative-type purposes.

More recently, prohibited non-lethal weapons have been permitted to for young legal professionals in Brisbane’s Roma Street and Sydney’s Martin Place.

“Yes I am fully aware that it is usually illegal to carry pepper spray” she says.

“It’s also illegal to slide your hands up someone’s dress without their consent, but nobody seems to give a fuck about that”

“But I’ll be letting this thing pop off for much less than that on Thursday night. If I hear one comment about the receptionist’s ‘side-boob’ – I’ll be airing out my new bottle of lachrymatory agent”

Harris works at the prestigious Hunter-Wood & Jamesons firm in the Betootan Financial District, and said while she is appreciative of the luxurious corporate events that the firm puts on, she often dreads attending them, knowing that an unavoidable pass at her will be coming that night.

“If we can maintain an understanding, me and the partners, that they will get immobilised for touching or leering, then it might be a fun night after all”

Terribly-Wrapped Present Obviously From Fuck-Up Of A Brother

TEXT:

When John Wilmott was 14, his older brother Mark was sent home from school for the last time.

He was only months away from sitting his final high school exams when he was caught smoking and drinking alone on school grounds.

Rather than provide counselling or even a swift, over-the-top punishment regime, his boarding school came to the conclusion that he’d be better off back at home in his parent’s Betoota Ponds sunroom.

Though John’s education was much less eventful at the bourgeois hellhole of an institution, which cannot be named due to legal reasons, Mark’s experience certainly rubbed off on him.

“It was all downhill from there,” said John, now a 19-year-old copyboy here at The Advocate.

“Mark never sat his high school exams and ended up bouncing from one predatory diploma-based ‘college’ to another,”

“We don’t see or hear from him much during the year but he always manages to come home for Christmas. Last thing I heard was he’s keen on joining the military, which’d be good I guess. Christ knows what he does now.”

Arriving back in town this afternoon, John seemed brighter and cleaner than he typically looked of a winter’s day.

Speaking to our reporters earlier this afternoon, the now 23-year-old said that he hopes his fuck-up days are behind him now – something he’s keen to prove by bringing presents home with him from the Far East.

“I’m living on the Goldie now with a few mates, working at a real estate agency,” he said.

“Doing leasings at the moment, which is bullshit pay for bullshit work. Might even go back to the Polytechnic in Miami and do my high school equivalency. I’m doing my best to get back on my feet, that’s all anyone can ask of me,”

“Saved up for a bunch of presents as well, hopefully, the folks’ll see I’m starting to take a bit of responsibility in life.”

But as John came home early from work today, he saw the presents Mark brought with him from the coast under the tree.”

“Jesus! You can tell which ones he wrapped!” he laughed.

“Ah.. yeah. Shouldn’t laugh. Mum still buys my presents for the family and wraps them, too.”

Student Household Unveils Pathetic Christmas Tree

TEXT:

Though money is tight and festive cheer is at an all-time low, a troupe of local students have attempted to bring joy into their filthy home by erecting a humble Christmas tree.

But one man’s humble is another man’s pathetic.

Speaking to The Advocate this morning, Macy Peterson, a second-year graphic design student at South Betoota Polytechnic, said that even though a real tree was financially out of reach, she and her three other housemates made do.

“We all walked down to the føtex in Danish Town to scope out a tree but they were all over a hundred clams a pop so we said fuck that and went looking around the neighbourhood for a shrub or something,” she said.

“Matt, my housemate, jumped over this wall on Asmussens Alle and found some pencil pines or something in this rich bloke’s garden. He pulled one out of the ground and hoiked it over the wall. Then we legged it back home,”

“When we were in the føtex, Dylan, another housemate, gooched some tree decorations and a kilo of honey BBQ chicken wings from the deli so we’re all set I think. We planted it in our green bin and it looks great.”

When our reporter asked if they planned on exchanging gifts, the group said they weren’t planning on it but a dinner around the big day is in the pipeline.

Matt and Dylan are both planning on returning home in the coming days, leaving Macy and her other housemate alone over the holiday period.

Jennifer Galway, of the attic bedroom, said that Macy and her plan on having dinner and exchanging gifts – which are expected to be equally as pathetic and depressing as their Christmas tree.

“It’ll be nice,” she said.

“Just Mace and I, together on Christmas Eve, eating a BBQ chicken with a stale roll and coleslaw. When we’re older, we’ll miss these days.”

Red P-Plates On VW Golf A Fairly Good Indication Dad’s Making Bank

TEXT:

A link between the Volkswagen Golf and young women from affluent households has been discovered in a recent report published by theHousehold Wealth Index (HWI).

Parts of the study suggests most Volkswagen Golfs adorned with red P-Plates are registered to an address in Betoota Grove – the traditional LNP heartland of town and epicentre of wealth. 

The findings released by the HWI are based upon 24 months of data, and link 91% of purchases of the popular hatchback to local men aged in their 50s.

However, the rate at which these men drive the cars is well, well below that figure.

Royal Betoota College Of The Arts student, Bridget Andrews, told us that while her 2016 Golf is registered in her father’s name, it’s essentially hers. 

“Dad got this car when I got my licence by coincidence,” she said. 

“He said I got use it whenever I want but when my sister gets her license, we have to share it. Fat fucking chance of that ever happening. Also, chances of her passing the driving test? Hello! She’s got the spatial awareness of a Venetian tourist high on Ketamine. No way.”

Although Andrews was unaware of how much the car was valued at, she informed us that she transferred $2,000 to her father’s account after the purchase as a sign of goodwill.

“One thing Dad always told me growing up, he said, ‘Bridge, there’s not free lunches in the cunt of a world and life is just a sea of pain and disappointment,’ or something grim like that,” she said.

“So I transferred him like half the money for it, because there’s no free lunches!”

Andrews’ father Michael assured the The Advocate that the $2,000 transaction did take place.

“Yes it did, and I made sure it did. Because it’s really important that she knows the value of money you know.”

Resident Cockroach Appalled By The Living Conditions In Local Share House

“These people are animals,” he said.

“I can’t it any longer, I’m moving out.”

Peter the Cockroach only moved into the homely but ultimately unlivable Betoota Heights townhouse in October – but even an insect as notoriously filthy as he is cannot stand the mess.

Three residents will be left at the Maxwell Road address when the 3-week-old finally hands his key back sometime before Christmas.

And they couldn’t be happier.

“He’s such a fun sucker,” said Gilbert Doink, who calls the master bedroom his own.

“I’m glad he’s moving out, to be real with you, dog. Fucking Peter was always narcing us about leaving lights on and touching his food,”

“The final straw, I think, was somebody spilt beer all over his Real Estate vinyl that he left out on the coffee table. Like that wasn’t half his fault anyway.”

But when our reporters caught up with Peter at a nearby bin, he said it wasn’t so much the people he lived with, it was the way that they lived.

He explained that he was ‘appalled constantly’ by the state of the common living areas.

A general blasé attitude toward paying the rent and most other bills on time also irked the cockroach.

“I think most people who’ve lived in a share house have gotten to the point I got to yesterday,” he said.

“Enough is enough, I have to get the fuck out of this dump,”

“Even if it bankrupts me, I don’t care.”

Geologists Confirm Landmass Unable To Look After Local Girl’s Best Friend

TEXT:

Looking through the filthy plate glass windows of the Pisse Dans Ma Poche Cafe on Rue de Saudade this morning, Emma Castor couldn’t help but think of her best friend who’s no longer with us.

Last year, she bid a bittersweet farewell to Katie Frog, who decided that life in Betoota, the Paris of the Diamantina, wasn’t for her.

Like many other disillusioned and directionless young Australians, she moved to London – seeking to find answers to some of life’s most difficult questions.

“You look after her, London!” wrote Emma, in a longwinded and mildly uncomfortable Instagram tribute.

The 27-year-old followed up with a promise as hollow as one made on an election trail.

“I’ll see you soon, Katie. #Europe2018! Don’t worry about me, I’ll keep Betoota warm for you for when you get back!”

However, Ms Castor is not alone in asking the Lithosphere, the rigid, outermost shell of a terrestrial-type planet such as Earth, to look after a friend.

The CSIRO, arguably Australia’s peak scientific body, have also noticed the trend.

The Advocate spoke to a local geologist, Dr Clive Munro, about the social media phenomenon this afternoon.

“I have also noticed the trend,” said the father-of-four.

“Recently, I had one daughter leave on exchange to Japan for a semester. My other girls left touching messages on their personal Instagram accounts, some of which asked the Japanese archipelago to ‘look after’ my daughter as if it were some primaeval deity,”

“As a doctor of geology and a keen follower of the lithosphere, I can assure you that it won’t look after you. In fact, in Japan, it’s more likely that it’ll end up killing you compared to Australia! Anyway, it’s the thought that counts.”

Spraying Deodorant Over Naked Flame Still Cool According To Local Hellraiser

TEXT:

A 16-year-old Betoota Grove boy woke this morning with a sense of immense pride.

Last night Nick Green impressed guests at his sleepover by successfully executing the flamethrower, a stunt that sees antiperspirant deodorant sprayed over a naked flame.

The Advocate caught up with Nick shortly after his guests left.

“Wow!” exclaimed Nick. “If this doesn’t make me cool, nothing will. None of them noticed I had an PS4 and an Xbox,”

The promising vandal first observed this flaming feat while visiting his older cousin Tyson (28), a fridge technician from nearby Betoota Ponds. According to Nick, he witnessed Tyson perform the stunt in front of his own friends, who were very impressed with cousin Ty’s pyromancy skills.

According to Tyson, he willingly taught his younger cousin the flamethrower in an effort to help him make friends.

“Nick’s a bit of a labrador in a kelpie’s world, you know? Picking up what I’m putting down?” he asked.

“The flamethrower is grouse, but. Me and the boys [sic] usually whip it out for old time’s sake but yeah. Hopefully, it helps young Nicky boy transition into manhood. It takes a real man to do the flamethrower.”

At this stage, it’s unclear whether the flamethrower will ever lose its local appeal.

Morbidly-Hungover Account Executive Rifles Through Office First Aid Kit Looking For Panadol

TEXT:

A client’s Christmas Party last night and a vomit on the bus this morning, Jenny Rutland is living life in the fast lane.

Friends of the 26-year-old told her she’d be better off calling in sick, that there’s no dishonour in admitting defeat to the Silly Season.

But the happiness of her clients is paramount.

Which is why today she’s soldiering on through the pain and nausea to sit at her desk and appear to be productive.

After lunch, when the lack of sleep and food were really beginning to take their toll on Jen, she carefully made her way to the office kitchenette to raid the first aid kit – searching fruitlessly for some pain relief.

“Fuck!” she said softly.

“Somebody’s beat me to it! The box is empty. Fucks sake, there’s only band-aids and gauses in here. Even the scissors are missing,”

“God damn, I feel sick.”

However, the resourceful Leo explained to her manager that she needed to duck outside for a minute, stretch her legs et al.

He smiled, nodded and went back to doing fucking nothing.

Jenny made her way downstairs onto Mulholland Street near the corner of Vampire Boulevard and limped up the footpath to Caltex.

The airconditioning’s cool bite on her cheeks was delightful but one thing that wasn’t, according to Rutland, was the price of a 1L bottle of generic spring water and a 24 pack of pain pingers.

“Fuck me roan!” she said.

“$13? Are you fucking kidding me? Jesus fucking wept, mate. I might as well get a pie as well!”

The cashier explained the total plus the pie would be $20 and Jenny sighed and tapped her Visa debit card on the thing and walked out.

Initial reports have suggested that the pie was divine.

Wearing A Trench Coat In Summer The Least Weird Thing About Local Lone Wolf

“He sometimes even wears gloves,” said one classmate.

“I’ve seen him with a scarf wrapped around his neck – the same day it was so hot, the goannas were frying on the sand,” said another.

They’re talking about is Bont Coleman, a well-known local drifter who controversially enrolled in the South Betoota Polytechnic College after threatening to blow it up in 2013.

The 34-year-old has also mailed bullets to various public figures, some of which he didn’t even have anything against.

Bont is weird in every sense of the world.

He spoke to The Advocate about his fashion sense a short time ago.

“It is very suspicious to me that someone like you would be interested in what I wear,” he said, quite uncomfortably.

“Are you a Rothchild? Or a reptilian humanoid? It’s quite obvious to me that you are not a real person.”

Our reporter then terminated the interview and looked for the nearest exit.

Gauging just how uncomfortable he was making everybody in the room, Bont then kindly offered an explanation as to why he dons warm clothes when it’s very, very hot outside.

“What is normal you is not normal to me,” he said.

“I wear a trench coat because I think I look like a fucking mad cunt in it. The same reason why all those manboobed careermen that work in the city shop at RM Williams but get frightened around livestock and horses,”

Community-Minded McDonalds Worker Always Rounds Up When Counting McNuggets

A popular part-time crew trainer at the Daroo Street McDonald’s Family Restaurant has revealed to The Advocate that he sneaks extra McNuggets into customer’s orders because he’s community-minded and ‘fast-food Robin Hood’.

Douglas Milton, a 24-year-old student at the South Betoota Polytechnic College, said he rounds up to the nearest ten when he puts together a McNugget order then explains the discrepancy in stock by writing it up as wastage.

However, when asked by our reporters if he had any ill-will toward his employer, the happy-go-lucky Gemini said he didn’t – but stopped short of saying he enjoyed his job.

“What I like most about my role here at McDonald’s is that I’m able to give back to the community by ripping off an immoral, faceless, global corporation,” he said.

“I’m 90% sure my boss knows about my little scheme but at the end of the day, I don’t think he cares. But yeah, I know how much joy finding an extra McNugget or seven can bring someone, which I why I get such a good feeling doing it,”

“Yes, I will keep doing it. I’ll keep doing it until the day I leave this place. I’m not sorry for causing a small loss to McDonald’s, which pays fuck all corporate tax in Australia anyway, to make somebody’s day.”

The Advocate put the call out to the residents surrounding the Daroo Street institution, especially those who frequent the McDonald’s to see if any could corroborate Mr Milton’s claims.

There were thousands of replies.

Jenny Porterhouse, a receptionist at the local Department of Primary Industries office, said she often helps herself to a 10-pack of McNuggets on the way home as a special treat.

Just yesterday, she found 24 chicken McNuggets crammed into her small 10-pack box.

“I was blown away,” she said.

“When the lady handed me the bag through the drive-through window, I could feel the weight of it and felt something was awry. But I didn’t wait around to ask,”

“I gunned my little Echo around the corner, squeeking the tyres, into the French Quarter Business Park and opened the bag. I was gobsmacked. The bag was almost full of nuggets. I thought I was going to pass out from sheer ecstasy. But now I know,”

“I’m glad people like Douglas exist in the world. They’re titans walking amongst us.”

Ageing Laptop Mercifully Euthanised For The Third Time Today

Affectionately known as ‘Tracey the Toshiba’ by those close to her, a local laptop has been tragically put to sleep for the third time today by her owner after freezing yet again.

Frowning and sighing from behind his lecture desk, Mark Dengue gently held down Tracey’s power button until she drifted off into the next word after she repeatedly failed to open Microsoft Word.

In her day, Tracey could run with the best of them.

“She was a giant killer back then,” said Mark, who’s somehow resisted the urge to fold Tracey’s screen backwards onto herself.

“But now, now she’s getting tired. I feel she might be at the end of her used by date. I think it might be time to hoik Tracey into the creek and get something new, something with a bit more grunt,”

“I’m only an Arts student, so I don’t need anything vaguely useful because I don’t plan on doing anything vaguely useful with my degree. I was thinking about flexirenting a Mac?”

From the outside, Morris & Sons Auto in Betoota Heights looks pleasant enough.

“I went in to pay the bill, which was fucking extortionate I might add, and wam!” she said.

“Full frontal nudity right next to the fucking clock! It plain view of customers! I couldn’t believe it! I mean, is this commonplace in the auto repair industry?”

Speaking candidly to The Advocate, David explained that the current rules and regulations of the industry dictate that he must have no less than seven nude calendars on the premises  – or face harsh penalties.

“They’re actually out of date most of them,” he said.

“That one in the office has been there since 2003. That’s the least offensive calendar in the whole building. There’s not much I can do about that,”

Country Butcher Ramps Christmas Advertisements With Pinch Of Parsley

TEXT:

A country butcher has today revealed his success in the meatslinging game comes from the random pinch of parsley he places ontop of raw meat before having it photographed.

Boris Gleitzman (56), who for many years has been rumoured to hold close ties with organised crime figures in the greater Diamantina area, has today said that sending eight kids to private school in Brisbane is purely a result of the parsley – and nothing more sinister than that.

“It changed my whole business, moit” says Boris.

“Drop the raw cut on a white backdrop, pinch of parsley on the top and the fucking thing sells itself”

Boris believes his 2nd-generation family business, BettaBetootaMeats, has only managed to survive the malicious attacks of the Coles and Woolworths duopoly due to the pinch of parsley.

“Especially around Christmas time mate”

“Get the shit in the local papers, maybe a cinema ad, hire a backpacker to hand out flyers out the back of the pub”

“I even put a fistful of the shit in the meat tray that I donate to the pub. People reckon it helps with freshness but I don’t think so”

“It’s called marketing dickheads. And no, I don’t know what happened to that bookmaker that disappeared at the Royal a few years back”

Local shopper, Deborah (55) says while the deli at woolies has much cheaper prices, they just don’t manage to sell the meat as well as Boris.

“There’s just something about it” she says.

“That, and the fact he gives my grandsons a string of highly processed cheerios each time we rock up”

“It’s much fresher meat at BettaBetoota”

WTF: Samoan Employee Not Interested In Playing In Company Rugby Tens Side

In a massive blow to the mood of the bosses, a Samoan account manager has said that he is not interested in joining the companies rugby 10s side.

The executives of a Betoota-based consultancy firm, Jackson Organisation Consultancy Consolidated (JOCCs), were previously under the assumption that the white-collar Pacific Islander would be a walk up start to the team, and might even have a history of playing representative football.

However, to their dismay, Louis Lima (31) grew up playing soccer.

“Oh for fuck’s sake” said the furious CFO, Ken Jackson (68)

“Who else have we got? Dylan from HR. That bloke would pull up lame in a touch comp”

Despite completely innapropriate insistence from up above, Louis says he refuses to give into the racial profiling.

“No way cunt” Louis told our reporters

“I’ve got two kids at home, I’m not risking a poorly-insured hamstring knee injury just so these red-nosed pissheads can show off to their corporate mates from club days.

Louis says aside from assumptions that he enjoys reggae music and has cousins who lop down trees at a cheap rate, the rugby stereotype is by far his least favourite.

“It is completely out of line to assume that I’m good at football because I am Polynesian”

“I didn’t even make Aussie schoolboys – I only made the Queensland side because Karmichael got glandular fever”

Bloke With Poor Problem Solving Skills Blames The Rum

TEXT:

“The rum made me do it,” claimed local carpenter Jack Derwent today.

After shattering a bloke’s jaw out the front of the Royal on the weekend, Derwent confirmed it wasn’t his poor problem solving skills or gnawing insecurities that caused the incident, but the fact that he was drinking a certain type of alcohol.

“Haha fuck you were punchy on the weekend Jackie boy,” said Kosta, another tradie who was also drinking at the Royal on the weekend.

“Nah mate, it I think it was because I was drinking rum aye,” Derwent said.

“The rum always makes me a bit agro I reckon.”

Despite the fact Derwent is always sniffing around for a stink on the footy field and purposely bumps into people at the pub after a few drinks, the born and bred Orange boy says alcohol derived from sugar cane is the reason he often wants to put other blokes to sleep.

When asked about whether he should maybe consider working on some of his antisocial personality traits Derwent assured us that he just needs to go easy on the sugarcane champagne.

“Honestly I reckon if I just stick to beers, I will be able to control myself hey.”

We asked Kosta, whether a certain type of alcohol was in fact the culprit on the weekend;

“Lol. No. Did he actually try that. Jesus Christ. Before he even touched a rumbo and coke he was talking about levelling that “cocky cunt.”

Kostapoulos told us that the “cocky cunt” had looked vaguely in the group’s direction over the course of the night, and for some reason Derwent decided he was “gonna put him in his place” – before landing one out the front and eventually being gang bashed by bouncers.

“Anyway, thanks for letting me vent. Really helped. Cheers.”

The Advocate paid a visit to Wristy Road this afternoon to hear first hand why they were consuming so much grog during the week but nobody was at home.

Speaking to neighbours, some were able to confirm that the share house is indeed notorious for their drinking in the area and that it’s begun to impact on other local residents.

One resident, who asked to remain anonymous, said that the house is full of alcoholics and perverts.

“It seems all they do of an evening time is drink!” said the weak-chinned man.

“Once I asked them to turn the music down, which was quite loud. They turned it down and apologised but I could still hear them call me names after they did. One of them called me a ‘tired looking old cunt’ and a ‘French Quarter rent boy’ which is extremely offensive,”

“It’s offensive because I am a homeowner and they are renters! Anyway, they’re probably asleep in there hungover or strung out!”

Short Mate Says He Doesn’t Care About Jokes About His Height But It’s Just Shit Banter

TEXT:

The token short fella in a local group of mates has told The Advocate today that jokes about his stature aren’t annoying because they get under his skin, but because they are just not funny.

Lukas Rowlands, who nudges a touch over 170 centimetres, has copped a fair amount of shit over the last 10 or so years and has just about had enough.

“It’s bullshit. It’s not funny, it’s not good banter, it’s just shit low hanging fruit and I’m over it.”

“Like how is picking on a bloke for something he has no influence over good chat? Go on riddle me that? Those fat cunts that rip me can go and lose weight but I can’t make myself taller can I.”

When we pointed out that it seemed as though his friends had in fact got under his skin by doing things like informing him that he could have been a jockey, Rowlands snapped.

“Fuck off. They haven’t gotten under my skin. It really doesn’t bother me. Just drop it. Don’t you cunts have something better to do? Leave me alone.”

Whilst he assures us otherwise, it does seem as though Rowlands does have an issue with his friends  reminding him that he can’t really play any position on the footy field other than halfback.

House mate and close friend Phil Johnson confirmed that Rowlands 100% has a problem with short jokes.

“It’s not even worth it anymore honestly. I try and avoid pasting him on the subject cause he just spends the next half hour plotting how to embarrass me in front of the boys.”

Rowlands girlfriend Jacelyn Crowe said that he used to find the flirtatious jokes about her being taller than him funny before they started dating, but she very quickly realised to drop them.

“Yeah he would visibly go quiet and didn’t speak to me for a few hours after I offered him my heels,  so I dropped the horseplay.”

Local Bank Offers Home Loans To Fans Planning On Eating And Drinking At The Cricket

TEXT:

The Betoota Credit Union [BCU], known for their competitive home loan rates and customer service, have announced today that they’ll bend over backwards to help people from all walks of Betootanese life realise their dreams by going to the cricket this summer.

Going to the cricket, like home ownership, is simply out of reach for many young locals.

But BCU wants to change that.

“Cricket should be inclusive, it’s a game that everyone should enjoy and be able to attend,” said branch manager Peter Willis.

“That’s why we’re offering a home loan-style loan for those younger members of the community so they can get on the next Boeing and head down to either Melbourne or Sydney. Perhaps even across to Perth for the next Test if they’re feeling adventurous,”

“Coupled with our lowest interest rate guarantee, we here at BCU don’t see why anyone should miss out on eating and drinking at a game of Test cricket.”

Speaking to The Advocate regarding his experiences at the cricket last year, local 27-year-old Fergus Liston said that while he enjoyed himself immensely during the Perth Test, it hasn’t done wonders for his financial situation.

He joined our reporters at the BCU Porterhouse Road branch for a coffee and a real chat.

“I think all up, I spent almost $360 000 at the cricket last year,” he said.

“And I didn’t even get pissed once. All they had was that Great Northern and XXXX cat piss. The only heavy stuff on the ground was the red wine – and I’ve spat out gollies with more volume than what they serve you,”

“That and I ate maybe 4 pies? That might account for about a fifth of it. Plus, those mid-strength just make you tired and piss heaps. Other than that, I had a great time. But now I’m locked into paying it off until 2047. I will be 57 when I make the last payment.”

To apply for a BCU Cricket Loan, please duck into any branch before Christmas Eve to hand in your application personally. If you can choke the bank manager out, you’ll be approved on the spot.

This was a paid presentation from the Betoota Credit Union, where they put the ‘U’ into ‘Happuness’

STUDY: Flying Domestic Business Class Is A Sign From God You Have Too Much Money

TEXT:

If you didn’t know Alistair Downlands-Saddlewood, you’d think he’d just be another tired old gibbering cunt with too much money and time to burn.

But to those that know him, he’s a polite and kind senior member of the Betoota Heights society.

The 67-year-old is an active member of the Royal Betoota Golf Club and volunteers for his local Rotary Association, Meals on Wheels and also coaches youth tennis.

Alistair believes the key to happiness is giving back to those less fortunate them him.

To his friends, he’s a good man.

However, when Michael Glenfont passed him as he boarded this morning’s Qantas service to Rockhampton, he came to the conclusion that Alistair is just another ageing male with too much money and time to burn.

“Who the fuck even flying domestic business?” Michael said as he found his economy seat next to our reporter.

“I’ll tell you who. Rich old white dickheads with too much money. Flying domestic business is a sign from God that you’ve got too much money. I mean, it’s only three hours to the coast. Who can’t do three hours in a seat like this?”

“Anyway, you should listen to this podcast. It’s called the Joe Rogan Experience and they talk about shit like drugs and kickboxing. It’s grouse.”

However, upon landing in the capital of Queensland beef, The Advocate caught up with Mr Downlands-Saddlewood to ask him a few questions about his experiences flying in the front of the plane.

While he was initially sheepish about doing it, he soon opened up as to why he chooses to fly in the red seats as opposed to ‘slumming it’ in cattle class.

“He’s basically right, you know,” he said.

“I can afford it so why not. Put it this way, if you were in my position, would you do it? Yeah sure, I’ve made a few dollars here and there in business and I’ve been quite successful  and to be honest, I couldn’t give two fucks about what anybody has to say about it,”

“To answer your question, no it’s not worth the money. It’s an absolute rip off and it shouldn’t even exist. But I’m old and rich so I can do whatever the fuck I want. If arson wasn’t illegal, I’d burn down one of my investment properties such to watch it burn.”

Local 27-Year Old Officially Old Enough To Know Better

TEXT:

Reports are currently circulating that close friends of shop assistant Rachel Dale have given up on any chance of her getting her shit together despite the fact that at 27, she should probably know better by now.

While many people in Dale’s generation are usually mocked by their lack of visible achievement, travelling related debt and tentative plans to finish a TAFE course, Dale’s friends state they wish those problems were the kind Rachel had.

“She’s done MDMA every weekend for the past three years and it’s beginning to melt her a bit upstairs.”

Rumours of Dale’s drug use have long been known throughout Betoota, evident by her sombre and inattentive attitude on Sunday morning shifts at Betoota Newsagents.

“We’re not telling her she has to stop altogether but honestly there’s no need to get on the rack when you’ve got a 6 am start and no one is going to be partying but you. How she doesn’t know that by now is beyond me!”

Evidently, drug abuse appears to be only one of a myriad of issues Dale is failing to address. Reports from a close friend state that personal hygiene has been an ongoing issue for this 27-year-old who by now, should really know a thing or two about it.

“It’s not that hard to wash a hoodie, is it? You’d think if you wore it everywhere you’d take care it right? Nup! Pretty sure there are spew stains on it from her 26th! Just wash it or better yet, buy a new one because 27 is too old to be wearing a ROXY hoodie!”

A possible positive to Dale’s rejection of personal hygiene would be keeping her on/off boyfriend and aspiring BMX star Taylor “Milky” Blackstock (41) at bay but according to those close to Dale that is not the case.

“Do not get me started on Milky. Always cosying up to her when he needs funding for his next BMX film then pissing off with one of her friends as soon as he gets it. Every. Time.”

“She just deserves all the shit that happens to her now.”

Awaiting the generic getting together of shit and finishing the two and a half remaining years of a TAFE course are officially pipe dreams for Dale who recently announced her most exciting news in years.

“I’m thinking of getting dreadlocks. New start, new me you know.”

Local Coward Orders Starter As Main

TEXT:

Local Wimp Ben Carter (34) has a lot to answer to after ordering an entre sized pasta dish as his main meal during a dinner out with friends.

“I just didn’t feel like a full-sized OK! What’s the big deal?”

It has been reported, upon ordering the entre sized ravioli and specifying “can I get it as my main though?” Carter triggered a series of sniggers from around the table.

Witness reports suggest that Carter’s order prompted some of the blokier men at the table to add garlic bread to their order in an attempt to flex their manly hunger whilst showing off as much neck tattoo as possible.

“Yeah, extra garlic bread thanks. And make sure you bring the dessert menu round once we’re done thanks love.”

According to the diners, Carter’s portion controlled humiliation did not hit it’s stride until the waiter delivered his entre sized ‘main’ to his girlfriend instead of him.

Eyewitness accounts state this misunderstanding was met with a boom of overly blokey laughter followed by table slamming chants of “Entre boy! Entre boy!”

For Carter, evenings like this are becoming all too common and while he finds it frustrating he defends his decision.

“I’m the only bloke at the table whose belly isn’t touching the table, probably because I eat smaller portions.”

“They can act as blokey as they want, that’s fine. Eventually, they might realise the reason I’m the only one there with a girlfriend is because I take care of myself and don’t find toxic masculinity hilarious.”

In response to these allegations, Carter’s barrel-chested co-worker Tom Egan states he’s just making excuses.

“Haha! Classic entre boy! Bringing his missus everywhere and ordering entres! He didn’t even finish his tiny serving I ate it for him!”

“So, how ‘bout that dessert menu love?”

Socially Anxious Local Man Moments Away From Thanking Barber For Terrible Haircut

TEXT:

Waiting until his hair was simply too long to be professionally unacceptable, Harrison Glenbow sighed heavily this morning moments before stepping into his local barbershop.

Gone is his usual 60-year-old Polish hairdresser and in his place stands a well-built young man with a big beard; ironic tattoos covering most of his visible, sickly skin.

Where his barbershop used to stand is now some ghastly reproduction of an old-timey barbershop – but he didn’t realise until it was too late.

“Some days, I just don’t feel like talking to anybody,” said the 29-year-old.

“Especially people I don’t know very well. Vassilli, my old barber, understood that. I could just come in and tell him to make my hair shorter and then he would. Then I would give him $15 and leave. A perfect system,”

“This, on the other hand, is my worse nightmare. Let me tell you what happened. I even ended up thanking the hip cunt for fucking my hair up. The fuck is wrong with me?”

As soon as Glenbow entered the establishment, he went to leave.

But he was caught at the door.

“Hey man, take a seat we’ll be right with you,” said one of the Mumford & Son looking scissormen.

A few minutes passed, almost twenty according to Harrison.

“Ok bro, we’re ready for you. Jump in this chair and Banjo will be right with you, bro.”

Banjo Clemente, a tertiary-educated hairdresser with a HECS debt thicker than Eddie McGuire’s neck, started cutting Harrison’s hair without even so much as a prior discussion as to what he might like.

“So what can I do for you, man? Just a bit off the top and sides?” asked Banjo as he changed combs on the clippers.

“Oh yeah, sure. But not too much off the top, it’s starting to fall out and I’m worried it won’t grow back,” replied Harrison.

“Haha yeah, sure bud. No problemos, bro. I’ll fix you right up.”

Around that time, the meek Gemini wanted to say something but opted to just sit there and maintain eye contact with himself, wondering why he’s so broken and dead on the inside.

“When he was finished, I looked at myself in the mirror and just thought, ‘Oh look, I’ve got one of those fuck boy haircuts, you know those ones that the SS stormtroopers had during the war. Fuck yes,’ and I just sighed and felt like crying a bit,”

“So I got up, gave him a $50, got $5 back in change, then got the bus the rest of the way to work,”

“But before I left, I looked him in the eye and thanked him for making me look like an utter fuck head.”

Local Stoner Not Sure If He’s Just Tuned Into Thunderbirds Or ABC’s Insiders

TEXT:

“Hey,” he thought.

“Nick Xenophon doing talking to Virgil like that and why is Lady Penelope sitting on such as ghastly cheap couch?”

Speaking to The Advocate about what happened inside his head last night, a popular drug abuser said he turned on the television last night and what he saw didn’t make sense.

Julian Green wasn’t sure if he was watching Barrie Cassidy, of ABC’s Insiders fame, grill some political person or if he was about to see Gordon Tracey explore the depths of the big blue bin.

“Yeah man, it was weird,” he said slowly.

“I was like, why is this claymation puppet guy yelling at Kevin Rudd for? How do they even know each other? Isn’t Thunderbirds like 60 years old? It was all too much,”

“So I like got up and fixed myself some microwave popcorn while I tried to bring up the television guide on my phone because I was too high to go back into the living room without knowing what I was looking at, you know? Turns out it was Insiders.”

Our reporters reach out to Mr Cassidy and the Insiders production team for comment but have yet to receive a reply.

However, a number of other local cannabis users have come forward with similar stories.

A friend of Green’s, who asked to remain anonymous, told The Advocate that he’s been real bent before and stumbled upon Insiders – it too rocked him slightly.

“At first I was like, ‘I want to feel your face with my hands,’ but then I thought that’d be bit rude,” she said.

“But he is so mesmerising, even more so when you’ve doubled down on the edibles. I mean, I was sinking into the couch like it was made of mozzarella and there was Barrie, just swanning about on his couch like a real man about town,”

“Man I need a job.”

Timid Local Man Hospitalised After Eating Spoonful Of Cement At Rough Uncle’s Advice

TEXT:

An overly polite and skittish local Gemini is this afternoon recovering in hospital after ingesting a tablespoon of cement powder.

The incident occurred at approximately 3 pm this afternoon shortly after Michael McLaughlin and his uncle David happened upon a traffic accident involving a Hyundai and a camel.

The Hyundai Excel was travelling east on Dewhurst Rd when it collided with a large camel, injuring a 45-year-old local man and the animal.

As emergency crews arrived, the 19-year-old and his uncle were rendering first aid to the man before letting paramedics and police take over.

However, when the police opted to destroy the injured beast on the roadside, Michael told his uncle he felt queasy after witnessing a police constable turn the camel’s head inside-out with his service revolver.

“Have a spoon of cement, you fucking sook,” said David to his nephew.

“It’s only a fucking camel, jumping Jai-rusalem! Fuck me, if your father saw you acting like this he’d flip out like a harpooned dolphin he would!”

“Go on, there’s a spoon in the glovebox and a bag of cement in the tray. Hook in!”

Tragically, Michael didn’t understand that his loutish uncle was being facetious and he did as instructed.

Moments later, the Betoota Polytechnic College student collapsed at the rear of his uncle’s vehicle, which was still at the roadside next to the now very dead camel.

Luckily, ambulances were already there and he was quickly taken to hospital where doctors expect the young man to make a full recovery.

Age Of Empires II Now Sole Reason Why Man Still Has A Windows Computer

As a self-described young creative, James Coleman says he and his people have little use for a Windows computer these days.

He’s a popular but largely unsuccessful graphic designer that calls a French Quarter hotdesk an office.

No milk in this man’s coffee, he shoots from the hip and asks questions later.

Which is why the 29-year-old paused earlier this year when he went to throw his old Packard-Bell from the North Betoota’s Astoria Boulevard pedestrian bridge into oncoming traffic – he’d just treated himself to a new MacBook Pro.

“I thought, ‘What would I play Age of Empires on? It’ll go on my Mac somehow but fuck me it’s a pain,'” he said.

“So I stopped myself,”

“Rather than hoik that heavy old bitch off the bridge and through the windscreen of a speeding Volkswagen, I carried it home and played a death match. I knew I’d made the right choice when my Elite Teutonic Knights carved through the Aztecs like the common cold did. I will keep my Windows rig forever.”

Final Boss Of Farming Simulator 17 Revealed To Be El Niño

TEXT:

It doesn’t matter if you’ve got no primary production experience at all; it doesn’t matter if you’ve got 50 years under your belt.

The final obstacle to beating the hotly anticipated video game, Farming Simulator 18, will be a challenge to all that reach it.

It’s not stagnant wool prices or a kneejerk Labor snap ban on live export, nor is it flooding rains or a backpacker driving an uninsured header into a tree stump.

It’s El Niño.

Exacerbated by rapid climate change and global warming, the natural ocean cycle can often be the final nail in the coffin for many struggling farmers – which is why the game’s developers chose it as the ultimate challenge.

Speaking to The Advocate regarding the release, lead programmer Gresham Rasmussen, said that the final challenge of El Niño comes after a number of very challenging circumstances the player must overcome to beat the game.

“We’ve included a range of different things to challenge the player, both on and off the farmer,” he said.

“For example, if you have a child that’s not that bright or good at sport, you can expect to pay full tuition and boarding at a private school, which can start at around $25k for a subpar regional institution,”

“And then there’s all the other exciting parts of farming like workmen wrecking and losing gear and hiding from the Australian Tax Office. There’s even the option to visit an accountants office in-game and just let out swear words. None the less, the ultimate challenge comes in the form of zero rainfall.”

However, one local grazier told our reporters that he thinks the game is ‘bullshit’ and a ‘poor portrayal of primary producers.’

Jack Pearson, of the E.H. Pearson Cattle Company just outside the Betoota City Limits, explained that there’s a lot more to raising cattle than pushing a bunch of buttons.

“I bet they don’t have the option of poking about in a clapped out old Fergie spraying cotton bush,” he said.

“Which is what I used to do as a young fella around here. And I reckon you wouldn’t be able to flog a dough-banging ringer about the arse with a waddy, either. Then there’s the issue of how rough jackaroos are with gear. Cost me thousands it does,”

“The only use I could get out of this game is taking the CD out of the case and frisbeeing the wookatook thing into a creek.”

Crypto Investor Horrified To Learn 65-Year-Old Father Familiar With ‘Blockchain’

TEXT:

Visiting his parent’s leafy Betoota Heights home for dinner last night, Charlton Grosvenor thought he heard his father say ‘blockchain’ in passing conversation – so he asked him to repeat himself.

“What did you just say, Dad?”

When Ralf Grosvenor clarified what he said, the 26-year-old’s world began to shake.

Scoffing down the rest of his rare Filet Mignon, the popular salesman-by-day-turned-cryptocurrency-investor-by-night wondered to himself as his parents chatted in the kitchen how does his retired father know about blockchain.

He wanted to ask his father if he’s been looking into crypto but he couldn’t bring himself to do it.

Leaving shortly dessert, took the long way back to his trendy leased apartment in the Old City District along 13-Mile Road deep in thought.

“Maybe this is the top? If my Dad knows about cryptocurrency, it’s probably hit the mainstream. He was a merchant banker, though. But this is way too much,”

“I wonder if he’s bought any? Part of me hopes he has, part of me wishes he hasn’t.”

However, when our reporters spoke briefly with Mr Grosvenor, a former partner at one of the district’s premier and largest emerging market hedge funds, Desert Pea Strategic Advisory, he said he’s been around cryptocurrency for a long time.

Telling The Advocate that he often plays golf with former colleagues and friends in the finance industry and the whole cryptocurrency thing is old news to people in the game.

“It’s glorified gambling in a way,” he said.

“But yeah, I know about blockchain and all that. We moved a lot of money around for Goldman back in the day in and out of Russia using crypto. Fuck, we each put $50k into Bitcoin for a laugh over a decade ago. Why? You’ve spoken to Charlton have you?”

“Has he got money in crypto? Does he? Fuck me, it might be time sell up if he and his deadshit mates are getting into it.”

Millennial’s Fiscal Illiteracy First Apparent During Childhood Sim City Sessions

Wondering why he can’t seem to save a cent of his weekly pay packet, a popular 26-year-old hotel manager has revealed to The Advocate that his poor financial literacy goes back a long way.

Back to 1999 in fact.

Gregor Redpath told our reporters that he frequently found it difficult to difficult to balance his Sim City budgets as a child but that wasn’t enough to dampen his passion for the game.

The skittish Gemini spoke to our reporters poolside at his exclusive Greenview apartment complex, in the trendy, bohemian French Quarter district of Nouveau Enculé.

“You could just put cheats in when you ran out of money,” he said.

“My parents have basically cut me off financially now so I’m fucked on that front. It’s real life now; there are no cheat codes for Vodaphone or the ATO,”

“I was hopeless at Sim City, not the building part, I was grouse at that. It was more or less the balancing of the budgets. I’d just cave and give more funding to anybody who asked me for it. Hell, my town of 450 people needs a subway system? Yeah sure, I’ll build that for you guys. Turns out that was stupid.”

Mr Redpath had to pause several times during the interview, wiping tears away with the sleeve of his Supreme x Louis Vuitton hooded jumper.

At one point he stepped out of the room to answer a call on his iPhone X.

However, the call came from his mother, who asked him to pick up his little brother from high school. He apologised for cutting the interview short and left in his leased late model Volkswagen.

“Yeah. That makes sense, too”: Man Not That Surprised By Don Burke Allegations

TEXT:

Eating his Special K with an overly ripe banana throw on top, Michael Cleary was first shocked by the allegations levelled at Don Burke – but ultimately he decided that he wasn’t surprised.

The nation woke this morning to a string of sexual harassment, assault and misconduct accusations put on the former star of Burke’s Backyard, which was the nation’s most popular television show for almost two decades.

However, the TV horticulturalist’s world has come crash down – and he’s only got himself to blame according to Mr Cleary.

“You just have to look at him,” he said.

“That manky beard, soft hands and a voice smoother than a vanilla milkshake left out in the sun for a day. While it did shock me a bit, you know, because of his profile as a G-rated television host and whatnot. But yeah, it doesn’t surprise me in the slightest,”

Trendy Inner-City Burger Joint Fined For Not Playing Enough Wu-Tang Clan

TEXT:

The Keep Sydney Closed campaign has drawn massive support from the general public in the wake of a trendy inner-city burger bar reportedly playing the same Wu-Tang Clan song for the 412th time in a row.

Urban Burg opened their doors three months ago after owner Buster Krick (34) realised there was not an American style burger chain within 90 metres of their current premises.

“The hip hop theme gives us a nice point of difference. Plus hip hop is cool and so am I so…yeah.”

Boasting burger flavours you can’t get anywhere else besides the roughly 70 burger joints in Betoota’s gentrified French Quarter, Krick says Urban Burg is a place filled with musical and gastronomical discovery.

“You’re going to get a burger unlike any other and hear some of my favourite tracks you haven’t heard before. Most people don’t know about Wu-Tang except through friends, alternate radio stations, clothing, TV, mainstream radio stations, music streaming services, films and video games. Sort of goes with the underground theme.”

Despite boasting a ‘killer playlist’ Krick does not deny that he once played the Wu-Tang classic C.R.E.A.M. 412 times in a row during a busy Friday service.

“That’s only because we got in trouble for not playing it when we first opened. The licensing people were here handing out fines, and telling us to play more”

“So yeah, 412 times in a row is the record”

“It’s a great hip hop song, why shouldn’t we listen to it? Some people need to hear it a couple of times to understand what C.R.E.A.M. stands for.”

“It’s not my favourite Wu-Tang song though, no way. My favourite is one you probably don’t know.”

Hugger Beats Handshaker To Greeting

TEXT:

In what was a dramatic race, it has since been confirmed the hugger beat the handshaker to the greeting, in a meeting between two people who only kind of know each other.

While both sides showed promise early on, the outstretched arms of hugger Lauren Smith, trumped the tentative centred hand of shaker Alex Barnes who was quickly able to adjust his arms in time for the embrace.

In a brief statement by Barnes, the 31 year old explains his defeat and how he plans to move forward.

“[I] thought because we didn’t know each other very well that we’d go for the handshake but she clearly had other ideas. It’s difficult to say whether we can go back to a handshake now but I will be trying.”

“Perhaps I’ll need to be more confident with my outstretched hand next time.

Hugger Lauren Smith is absolutely ecstatic with today’s results.

“We’ve got another hugger ladies and gentlemen! Yes, we didn’t know each other that well, but a hug is a great way to get to know someone! Whoooo! Hug wins!”

Group hugs are taking place across the nation as hugging fans celebrate today’s victory.

For handshakers, the taste of defeat is becoming all too familiar. Head of the Handshakers Alliance Sam Haker (50) said today’s defeat is just one in a series of institutionalised bias that favours hugs over shakes.

“Some people don’t like the feeling of another weird, pudgy human form pressed up against them between two layers of clothes. It’s a basic right to not want to get hugged yet we rarely see it exercised in polite society and that has to change.”

In a direct response, head of the Australian Huggers Association, Richard Di Natale only had this to say to Sam Haker.

“Sound like someone needs a hug mate!”

“Get over here”

Law Clerk Repeatedly Pressured Into Joining Firm’s Lunch Time Mixed Netball Competition

TEXT:

“Why did I do law? Why didn’t I do something I enjoy?”

The answer to that is local law clerk Louise Degally didn’t want to die poor.

But after taking a clerkship with one of Betoota’s big six law firms, it seems that not even all the riches in town are enough to buy her soul.

“They [colleagues] keep cornering me, trying to make me sign up for the mixed netball competition they have with other firms during the lunch hour,” said the 23-year-old.

“I’d rather be skinned alive to be real with you.  What is wrong with these people? Don’t they have lives outside work? No! I don’t want to be your friend, I want to be your colleague! That’s it!”

“Any why during lunch? Why? Take your lunchtime mixed netball and shove it up your arse, Lucy! And David, fuck you and your mixed touch. After work time is my time.”

However, as much as the recent graduate doesn’t want to sign up for these light sporting commitments, Louise has conceded that it’s just a matter of time until she caves.

One thing that might save her is her summer caseload, which is a ‘fate worse than touch’ according to the popular Gemini.

“I’ve got the most boring clients in the world, which is a double-edged sword I guess,” she said.

“They take up a lot of time but I’m constantly two minutes away from putting my head in the microwave and setting it to defrost,”

“But it keeps me away from inter-frim mixed netball.”

Gone is the old Martin, the one that ‘woops’ and ‘hollers’ like a cheering American.

He’s been replaced by a placid, quiet and confident young business analyst that reads Tolkien in his spare time – which is whenever he’s not working, according to the man himself.

“I hate the concept of eBooks; the tactile feel of a book is just a part of the story as the words are,” he said, just days after he pissed in his own mouth in front of two strangers and a friend.

“Sharing a good book with somebody you care about is just as intimate as say, hugging is. A great story is a warm hug. I love to share literature with people I care about – which are basically all women,”

“Women are attracted to guys who read and have books, it’s a well-known fact.”

One of those on the receiving end of a Martin Fox book recommendation was fellow Betoota KPMG employee, Rachel Carmichael, who says she can see straight through this ‘whole facade.’

Having noticed that she’s reading the latest Janet Evanovich, Martin meandered through the cubicles toward Rachel’s desk this afternoon with a book in hand.

“Hey Rach,” he said, addressing her for the first time since they shared a lift ride in March.

“Trust you’ve been doing well. Anyway, glad to see there’s another bookworm in the office! [laughs] Anyway, babe. Got a book for you. Have you heard of Liane Moriarty? Yeah neither had I,”

“She’s got this cracking little book, Truly Madly Guilty, I think you’d love it. Here it is, I think you’ll…”

Rachel interrupted Martin to explain to him that he was mere seconds away from having a complaint made against him with HR.

Zimbabwean Migrants Who Still Refuse To Say Zimbabwe Have Some Interesting Opinions

TEXT:

A couple of Zimbabwean migrants currently residing in North Betoota’s new luxury housing estate have rattled several neighbours at a Christmas street party this afternoon.

This comes after the news that Robert Mugabe resigned as Zimbabwe’s president on Tuesday, a week after the army and his former political allies moved to end his four decades of rule.

Andrew and Peta Smith landed in Australia in the early 2000s but were apparently unable to bring their family money with them, they are now currently holding court with a loud explanation of the history of ‘Rhodesia’.

Their refusal to use the official title of ‘Zimbabwe’ should have been a red flag at the beginning of his rant, however, it is nowhere near as controversial as their take on Southern African ethnology and what they refer to as ‘learned helplessness’.

“You see. Shaw, thare wurr problums with the old wey of doing thungs” says Peta

“But, it wurked. It wurked wull. Betta thun whut is happinink thurr now”

Yesterday, the ruling ZANU-PF party nominated that the 75-year-old former Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa would fill the vacancy left by Mr Mugabe and he will be sworn in on Friday, according to government officials.

As the conversation steers towards Andrew’s honest opinion on African politics in his ‘bewtiful’ home nation, their 60-year-old Betootan neighbour Josie finds herself needing to take a seat.

“Jesus” she says.

“I haven’t heard people talk like that since Joh”

“These people are out of control”

Local Builder’s Phone Contacts Now Just First Names And Job Titles

TEXT:

Not even his partner-of-four-years is safe from Dale Packham’s method of organising his phone contacts.

Speaking to The Advocate this morning about the contents of his mobile telephone, the 27-year-old builder said it got too complicated having every ‘fuck head architect’ and ‘dumb cunt concreter’ save in his phone with their real names.

So he came up with his own system.

“At the Betoota Heights job, I’ve got John Tiler saved in my phone. Alex Plumber, Lance Brickie, Mike Sparky and Lewis Bunnings. It just makes it easier, so I changed every contact in my phone to follow that model,”

“So my girlfriend is saved as Kate Girlfriend. Mum is Jennifer Mum, Dad is David Dad and my Brother is Brother Sam, even though he’s not a predatory Catholic educator. It just works for me.”

However, after talking to our reporters regarding this method of organising phone contacts, our reporters were able to ascertain that nearly every tradesperson in town does the same thing.

In fact, Mr Peckham is saved in one tiler’s phone as ‘Dale The Cunt Foreman’ while a popular local engineer has him saved as ‘Dale Dumb Builder’ in his.

“You just meet too many people on the job to have them saved properly,” he said.

“I don’t expect you hydroponic office slaves to understand. Get some sun fuck boys.”

Local Boomers Not Thrilled With The Fact Their Daughter Met Her Fiancé On Tinder

TEXT:

Speaking candidly to The Advocate once he’d left his comfy Betoota Heights Queenslander, local father Malcolm Coolie said that while he’s happy for his middle daughter – he’s not rapt with the fact that she met him on popular dating app, Tinder.

“It just rubs me the wrong way, you know what I mean?” said the retired 68-year-old builder.

“Meeting somebody on the internet, to me, is pretty fucked to begin with. How can you trust them? You don’t even know who they are! They could be a serial killer for all you know,”

“Anyway, it was good to finally eyeball the cunt. You know he didn’t even ask me if he could marry Nadine? I mean, fuck me. What’s the world come do? Does anyone have any common decency anymore? Tell you what though, son. I’m glad I’m 68 because I’ve fucking down with this world. I’m going to take up smoking again.”

Nadine Coolie announced her engagement to Matthew Peterson, a local Catholic, earlier this week to the shock of many.

Her mother and Malcolm’s second wife, Rochelle, had to sit down after receiving the news.

She spoke to our reporters a short time ago regarding the whole ‘debacle’.

“Nadine has always been headstrong but this is just taking the piss,” she said.

“Isn’t Tinder the one that all the kids use to have premarital sex and sell drugs? When they said they met on Tinder, I collapsed on the spot right there in the kitchen. I damn near ripped the landline out of the wall on the way down. If it wasn’t for Mal, I would’ve Hendrix’d myself and choked on my own vomit!”

“But I’ve learned to accept him for who he is and that’s the man my Nadine is in love with.”

Unaware of the personal turmoil and anguish he’s unleashed on Mr and Mrs Coolie, Matthew said he and Nadine are looking forward to spending the rest of their lives together in peace and happiness.

However, even he knew there was something up when he and Nadine began discussing their upcoming wedding in Lombok.

“When I said we wanted to do it barefoot in Indonesia, I could see Rochelle’s eyes almost roll back into her head. I think she even convulsed a bit,” he said.

“Daddy Mal just looked out the window looking defeated,”

“But fuck ’em. Me and Nadine are basically a Springsteen song in the making. We’re going to be just fine.”

Promising High School Athlete Sadly Now A Personal Trainer

TEXT:

Samantha Kennedy and I were great friends in high school.

We played on the same soccer team and ran in the same circles – we were close.

But all that changed one day when a husky, loud middle-aged man stood idle on the sideline of our championship game against The Longreach School of Distance Education back in 2009.

That man was a college scout from America. We all knew it but deep down, we knew none of us were good enough.

However, this quiet American saw something in Sam we all saw but never spoke of.

Her bright academic confidence, humble disposition and footballing talent made her an ideal scholarship candidate to any US college.

At 19, Sam made the move to Berkeley in the Bay Area of San Fransisco where she excelled in everything she put her mind to. Though a number of injuries marred her soccering endeavours, she graduated with honours in Ceramic Art.

That was then.

Just last month, the Face Book told me that Sam had moved back to her parents renovated four bedroom Queenslander in Betoota Ponds and that she’d taken up a new position at a popular 24-hour gym nearby.

Sam spoke to The Advocate regarding her adventures around America and her recent return to the Simpson Desert.

“Yeah, to be fair I didn’t expect to move back here so soon,” she said.

“There was so much more I wanted to do in terms of soccer but my knees are more fucked than my Dad’s are now. I think they put me up in the higher grades too quickly, I wasn’t quite ready for the intensity but at the same time, I didn’t want to let the opportunity pass me by,”

“It’s sad in a way. I had so much promise, I could’ve gone to the Olympics. Don’t get me wrong, I like being a personal trainer and everything. But, you know, I’d rather be doing what I love rather than this. It’s so nice to see you again, Molly.”

Hipsters From Completely Gentrified Suburb Insist It’s Still Pretty Rough In Some Parts

TEXT:

A group freelance creatives insist that the sterile inner-city coffee-hub they live is actually still a bit gritty, in some parts.

Even though each of them have spent most of their lives in leafy family suburbs on the city’s fringe, before moving into the city to attend university six years ago, they say that this place is pretty much home now.

“It’s got everything. Like yeah, there are a lot of yuppies moving in, but it’s still pretty rough in some areas” said Leo, a songwriter who currently works Woolworths media team.

“Like, you’d be surprised. Even though there are 20 square foot studio apartments going for $2 million a pop, there’s a couple of rough streets”

Despite being the actual cause of gentrification in Betoota’s French Quarter, the young corporate creatives say that they are vehemently opposed to foreign ownership of terrace houses, as well as prams in pubs.

“These yuppies are trying to kill what this suburb actually stands for” says Salsa, a 27-year-old fashion buyer.

“It’s like, don’t you have leafy family suburbs that were literally built for you to feel safe in”

“But yeah, I don’t think they’ll be able to fully yuppify the place, the real side of the French Quarter is too established”

Gordon Ramsay’s New Book For ‘Fucking Donkeys That Can’t Fucking Cook!’

TEXT:

Just in time for Christmas, esteemed Scottish-born celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay has released a new cookbook aimed at building the confidence of those who are ‘still a bit intimidated’ by their kitchen, according to his publisher.

Fast Food For Fucking Donkeys, is slated to be released in coming weeks and Ramsey himself is set to head Down Under on his publicity tour.

Speaking candidly to The Advocate, the father-of-four explained that he was looking to simplify a number of his famous recipes so that they could be enjoyed quickly and easily than usual.

“Well mate, my publisher rang and said that lisping fuck Jamie Oliver was releasing a similar cookbook, like fucking 10-minute meals or some fucking shit like that,” he shouted.

“So they asked me if I could come up with something better and I said like fucking hell I can fucking do something better so I wrote this book for fucking donkeys that can’t fucking cook,”

“It’s an honest book. It’s like one of those flash birthday cards, innit? Like the ones that make noises and whatnot. Each time you turn the page of this cookbook, you’ll hear me call you a fucking donkey. It’s what I went through learning so it’ll work for you.”

One local domestic chef, Shelia Willmott, said she’s a fan of Ramsey’s recipes and looks forward to seeing what’s on offer this time around.

Willmott said she likes the way Gordon gets the job done and doesn’t piss in your pocket like Maggie Beer or Curtis Stone.

“If I end up with Matt Preston’s, who isn’t even a chef, cookbook, the person who gave it to me will be in my shit books,” she said.

“I love the way Gordon swears at people. It really gets me going. I had a professor at uni who looked quite dishevelled and he swore at us all the time and we all secretly wanted to jump him,”

“I’m a fucking donkey and I’m hungry.”

Degenerate In Need Of Secret Santa Presents Pays Visit To Local Sex Shop

TEXT:

His colleagues think he’s funny but it seems Sam Madden is about to that things too far.

The 31-year-old is lucky enough to work at local public relations firm, PorterNovelli South Betoota, twice voted the best place to work if you are dead on the inside.

One of the firm’s biggest drawcards is their ‘great work culture’ and ‘free coffee bar’ but this year, it’s said they’ve outdone themselves by organising a ‘Secret Santa’.

Which is why Sam found himself this morning in the Piston Fellatio sex shop on Mullholland Avenue, browsing the selections.

“I drew Mark from marketing,” he laughed.

“He’s a full on bible basher so I thought I’d get him a vibrating cock ring and a pink 16-inch rubber cock. It’s going to be so fucking funny, the look on his face. It’ll put the fear of Jesus in him, that’s for sure,”

“Anyway, I’ve only got a $20 budget so I reckon I might need to haggle with the pervert behind the counter a bit. I’ll have to twist his sick little arm off the get these for a lobster, that’s for sure.”

However, according to his superiors at PorterNovelli, Sam is cruising for a bruising.

Speaking candidly to The Advocate, his account director said that if he does end up getting Mark a sex toy for Secret Santa, he’d be booking himself an appointment with HR.

“In this day and age when you can’t do or say anything without somebody getting triggered or offended, I feel that Sam is in danger of upsetting someone in the office with his gift,” said boss Angela O’Donoghue.

“But that’s not for me to decide, that’s for HR. Personally, I think Sam is just another male who hasn’t felt the bite of consequence or denied privilege,”

“It is what it is, then you die.”

“How Do I Tell The Fellas I Want To Stay In Tonight Without Looking Like A Coward?”

TEXT:

Telling The Advocate that he slept like a Stalingrad sentry last night, Sandy Dorematte said he needs some red meat and a good night sleep more than a night on the tiles.

At a quarter to two this morning, the 29-year-old was playing BuckHunter in the Games Room of the Betoota Dolphins Club with a few mates. Limp Bizkit softly played over the speakers.

He hadn’t planned on it, he certainly hadn’t planned to put a tray of rums on his credit card either.

But as his WhatsApp group admin began rallying the troops again at 11 this morning, Sandy explained that he was trying to find any way out of it.

“Bec and I sat on the couch for an hour this afternoon drafting messages, trying to make it look like I wasn’t being a coward by backing out of a Saturday night,” he said.

“Ultimately, I think we got there in the end. I hope anyway,”

“I sent the ‘I can’t make it tonight,’ message like two hours ago and that was the last contribution made to the chat. It’s not like I’m weak. I could put some jeans on now and head out into the French Quarter and fight a cop by midnight if I wanted to. I just don’t have it in me tonight.”

The Advocate reached out to a number of Sandy’s friends in the group chat but neither of them wanted to go on record with how disappointed they are in him – and Bec for obviously leading him astray.

Local Dad Compromises

A local dad has had to combine both of his responsibilities today in an effort to keep everyone happy.

The first promise, which was made almost a week ago, to his mates – as well as his obligation to his young family – have been smushed together a local pub this afternoon.

“It’s called compromise” he says to our reporters.

“The boys would be filthy if I flaked, and obviously someone needs to look after the baby.”

“I do think that her mum’s low-key lunch with her sisters would probably be a more appropriate place to drag the kid to though”

After realising his wife was expecting him to take the reigns and look after their infant child while she went to lunch, Betoota man Braith Cartwright (31) has taken his kid to the Lord Kidman Hotel to watch the rugby league world cup alongside his degenerate mates.

“Oi can you guys not smoke around the kid” he half-heartedly asks.

“Oh yeah, sorry mate. Does she want to eat like some pretzels or something” says Bozza, a prominent tax cheat.

“Nah mate, she can barely eat bananas yet. She’d have trouble with a pretzel” says Braith.

“Does anyone have an iPhone charger so I can put on the Wiggles for her?”

With the Tonga vs Lebanon match a good five hours away, only time will tell if he can pull off this full-day session with the lads.

“We’ll see. Hopefully it doesn’t get to hot in this godforsaken place. The pokies room has aircon if she needs a nap”

Friends Of Tall Chick Sent To Make Inroads With Tall Bloke

A South Betoota man who is a fair nudge above-average-height has essentially just been told that he’s a sure bet tonight, if he’s keen.

Despite having about as much personality as a broken Obike, the 29-year-old data analyst has been accosted by several friends of a tall chick.

“Hey where are you from?” asks shorter friend number 1.

“Are you with friends?” asks short girl number 2.

The boring tall guy, who’s name is probably Brendan or some shit, is yet to realise he is about to be dragged into a trap by the hyper-flirty minions of a female patron who’s sick of having to wear flats on dates.

“Ummm.. I’m here with work” he says.

“[laughter] um, where, um, what’re you all up to tonight”

Unfortunately the boring tall guy catches on to their grand plan before they are able to throw him on the couch of a bar next to their taller friend.

“Come meet our friendddd” says short girl #1.

Boring tall guy peers through the crowd to the couch where the rest of the group remains, only to notice that things were indeed too good to be true. Their tall friend was keeping a close eye on progress, accidentally making eye contact.

“You’re only talking to me because I’m tall” he says with a quiver in his voice.

“You want me to go over there and hang out with you because your friend doesn’t like going out with guys shorter than her”

The shorter friends begin to backpedal.

“Not at all sweetie” says #2.

“We were just saying before how we all love bald guys with unkept rigs”

“You’re All Whipped!” Writes Young Professional To Group Chat While Drinking Alone In Seedy Sports Bar

Nobody wrote back to his 2 pm message asking if anybody was about for beers this afternoon, so Chris Masters took matters into his own hands.

The 29-year-old bachelor clocked out from his Old City district bespoke, boutique public relations agency at around 3 pm and walked straight into SportsQuest Bar & Grill on the ground floor of his building.

“Where are all you whipped cunts?” he wrote to ‘The Boy’s Noise’, one of two WhatsApp group chats he has with friends.

“I’m holding down the fort at the ‘Quest and none of you cowards are here! Where are you? Name and shame! Name and shame!”

But as time marches on, only an odd ‘kek’ and ‘lol’ were sent back by his friends.

He returns fire by recording himself making ‘whoopish’ whip noises and sending them back in response.

The Advocate reached out to a number of Boy’s Noise members for comment and received a smorgasbord of responses.

David Kalashnikov, who tried to make it clear on Wednesday that he’d be in Byron for a wedding this weekend, told our reporters that this is often the case with Masters.

“He likes to give it to me for spending the odd Friday night at home with the missus,” he said.

“But mate, we’re getting older now. My back hurts and I’m tired. Maybe I just want a nice steak, half a bottle of Malbec and an unenthusiastic handjob in the shower before bed tonight. Tomorrow is a whole new day,”

“Me and the boys might even feel like having a nice lunch before somebody gets the itch and caves into their desire to get themselves and the rest of us a few nice vials of B-grade Beirut MD?”

“That might just happen, you never know. But as for tonight? I’m doing nothing.”

Dad Manages To Make Enough Shepherds Pie To Last Family Entire Week That Mum Is Away

TEXT:

It is not lost on the teachers at South Betoota primary that the Andersen kids have been constantly yawning throughout the school day, after four 9:30pm sheperd’s pie dinners in a row.

The current dysfunctionality of their household has become so obvious that the school principal has gone as far as calling their oldest child to her office for a chat.

“Is everything alright at home, Tilly?”

“Mr Davies said he saw your brothers only had a servo pie and four carrots to share in their lunch box”

Tilly (12) comes clean.

“Mum’s been away for a week with her sisters” she replies.

“Aaah…” said the principal.

“Just how much longer is she away for?” the principal asks

“Just until the weekend” says Tilly.

Their Principal deduces that their current diet and obviously fractured sleeping patterns probably won’t kill these children over the next few days, and sends her back to class.

Surprisingly, their dad Bryan Andersen (41) actually fancies himself as quite a chef – but doesn’t really back himself when it comes to feeding four other humans each night.

“Dad, did this come from the same tray as the pie we had last night?” asks his third-oldest, Lauren.

“Nah, this is a new one!” he says, lying through his teeth. The kids automatically see straight through his white lie.

“Who wants ice cream and milo?” he offers as a distraction.

“You can have dessert before dinner tonight as well”

The youngest three cheer and make a dash for the freezer

“Not long now” he mutters to Tilly.

Big Boy’s Carb-Heavy Lunch Not Doing Wonders For Productivity

Barrelling down Adelaide Street in the heart of Betoota’s Financial District, a top-heavy auditor meandered down the footpath back to the office like mighty Ord River flows into the Timor Sea.

Graham Washbrook has a sweat on.

He’s just been down the road at the local Chinese, were he threw caution to the wind and hoovered a Chicken Chow Mein and a full-strength Coca-Cola.

The 28-year-old faceless Betoota KPMG employee knows deep down that nothing much else will be done today – he will merely occupy his space behind the desk and wait for 5 o’clock.

“That was at least two kilograms of food,” he said.

“I can feel the MSG coursing through my veins. Is this what dying feels like? Joe Rogan told me that DMT is released from your spinal fluid just before death. I’m seeing stars I’m that rooted,”

“Time is passing slowly.”

Thinking a coffee might be able to cure his lethargy, Washbrook went downstairs again to get a strong coffee.

Sadly, this only raised his heart rate substantially and didn’t offer much in the way of an energy boost.

A low-key, completely supervised, midweek social mixer is expected to become a full blown orgy tonight, that’s judging by a local school leavers discreet purchase at a out-of-the-way supermarket this afternoon.

Betoota teenager Ed Coorey (17) has full intentions of using every single one of the 24 ultra-thin latex condoms he just bought, which have since been stashed inside his sportsbag, alongside the hip flask of Cointreau that he stole from his parents.

Despite not having a girlfriend and only ever receiving a hand-job once in his life, Ed is under the impression that he could be getting just as much action tonight, as he imagined he’ll get every night this week.

“Everyone’s finished exams, it’s basically already started” he says with a smirk, knowing that whichever lucky girl sleeps with him tonight will not have experienced such a high-performing sexual partner in their entire life.

“[haha] It’s gonna be so lit” he says, finally making use of the youthful term for partying, that he’s seen on meme pages for several years now.

With his mum expecting a phone call in the next twenty minutes for an debrief on last night, the teenage sex machine will only have 85 minutes to have a shower and apply six coats of aftershave to his neck and wrists and penis, before being carpooled by the neighbour’s mum to a parent-heavy event several suburbs away.

Office Man Prematurely Begins Blaming His Degenerate Behaviour On The Silly Season

TEXT:

Despite only being halfway through the second financial quarter, an office person has begun blaming his out-of-character behaviour on it being the silly season.

Journalistically, the silly season is a period, usually during the summertime, when news media tend to place increased emphasis on reporting light-hearted, offbeat, or bizarre stories.

However, in recent times, that has grown to include a steady decline in sobriety and behaviour among the professional class.

Lewis Chadwick, who works in a local office with a computer and sometimes goes to local meetings, is one of those professionals who’s seemingly written 2017 off already.

“This is the best time of year,” he said.

“My agency has the best work culture. Everybody who works here is also friends and we do stuff outside of work like drink, go on river cruises and drink. Now we just drink in the office. I love working in public relations and advertising, I feel whole and my life, job and partner fulfil me,”

“Just relax, it’s the silly season. I was a vegetarian until last week, now I eat whatever the hell I want. I’d eat a whole roast koala if you put it in front of me. I might even drop acid one day. Who can stop me? Nobody! It’s the silly season.”

But if you speak to Lewis’ partner, Joanna Denison, she’d tell you that he’s jumped the gun once again.

Speaking candidly to The Advocate regarding her boyfriend’s recent behaviour, the popular midwife said he needs a reality check.

“He thinks I don’t even look at the transactions in the joint account,” she said.

“I look at the fucking transactions in the joint account. I ask him why he needed to withdraw $300 from a Betoota Heights service station ATM at 4am on a Thursday, he tells me it’s to pay his mates back for shouting dinner,”

“Where is he going for dinner? La Pisse Dans Ma Poche? I don’t care about the drugs, I care more about his lies and deceit. Fucking men, I tell you what. I fucking hate the silly season. Babies are born every day of the year, including Christmas! All his agency-cuck mates and him just spend summer getting pissed and high. It makes me so angry! Sorry, what were you saying?”

Unconditionally Loyal Mates Lie And Say He Doesn’t Deserve What She’s Done To Him

TEXT:

Central Betoota was the sight of an enormous gesture of friendship today as loyal mates of Riley Burrows (29) came forward to support him after his girlfriend Lydia Varney (30), made the right decision and left him earlier today.

“That’s fucked,” Burrow’s mate Braden Gillespie (28) responded on the group chat, despite the fact he clearly understands why.

“Lyds is a great girl and it makes sense she wanted out. She’s 30, wants kids and Riley is a big kid who would make a horrible father. Still, doesn’t really seem fair on him though.”

Since Burrow’s announcement of his split from Varney on the group chat titled “Bro-down (Hayden is gay) 8==D”, it has been active with messages of support from his close circle of friends, assuring him that it will be OK and disregarding the fact it’s definitely all his fault.

“No way mate!”

“Sorry to here mate. Shook”

“Shit, what a shock,”

It has since been revealed the consensus amongst the friends is that the real shock is that Varney did not leave Burrows sooner, due to his lack of maturity, wavering faithfulness and general disinterest in their relationship.

“I’d never let him date my sister let me put it that way. He’s upset now but he’ll go back to trying to feel up the glassy down the townie any day now. Won’t mention that for now though, he’s doing it tough poor bugger.”

Other members of the group chat insist the gesture that carried the most mateship and least accuracy came from Burrow’s childhood friend Luke D’Angelo.

“I just told him he’ll find someone better. Eventually, he’ll realise that Lyds was the best he’s ever going to get and that this was all his fault but there’s no point telling him that today.”

“Right now, what he needs is a dozen tinnies and to be around people who appreciate him for the childish dunce that no woman in their right mind would date he is.”

Confusion As Local Friend Actually Wasn’t Joking About Being Vegetarian Now

TEXT:

Wanda Mardy asked for her guest’s dietary requirements a week out from her weekend lunch jamboree at her parent’s heritage-listed Betoota Heights Queenslander.

What she received back in the post raised not one – but both eyebrows.

“Wow,” she said softly.

“There’s a lot of vegetarians this year. Christ, there’s a pescatarian. What the hell is that? Perhaps Dad shouldn’t have shot and cut up that alpaca now, a lot of it’ll end up in the deep freeze at this rate. My Peruvian curry will all go to waste,”

“Or maybe the omnivores will have to step up and eat enough meat to make any colorectal oncologist wince. God, this has thrown a spanner in the works. What do vegos even eat? Potatoe bake and salad? I hope Mum knows.”

Though it was a shock to the 29-year-old practising Quaker, it wasn’t much of a surprise to her life partner, Gregory, who’s noticed this downward trend in his friends.

He’s seen quite a number of his friends depart the platform of reason, only alight the train of life at the closest vegetarian station.

Food that’s certainly not for thought, according to him and a number of medical articles he’s prepared for the lunch today.

“I’m going to show them that being a vegetarian is counterintuitive and ultimately damaging to their health,” said Gregory.

“The articles I have prepared for lunch today hopefully sparks a warm debate over why perfectly normal people just stop eating meat,”

“I know a person’s diet is their business and their business only – but not when it comes to meat. Everyone should eat meat.”

First-Year Ringer Foolishly Tells Station Pilot It’s His First Time In A Chopper

TEXT:

Known around the area for his quiet, simple and stoic disposition, Micheal Rex made a classic mistake many first-year station hands make this afternoon – he got a lift back to the homestead with the chopper pilot moments after telling him it was his first time up in one.

The 19-year-old said he’d never been so scared in his whole life.

“He just went up and up and up like a rocket,” said Rex, staring a thousand yards off into the distance from the verandah wrapping around the quarters.

“We just kept going up and up, then we rolled down and really rolled completely over. It was just sky, ground, sky ground. I thought I was going to die and the whole time Ian was just laughing next to me. Thought he’d gone mad, I did,”

“Anyway, he cut the funny buggers out when he saw I was about to pass out from a mix of fear and g-forces so bloody Ian levelled out and we continued on home directly. Won’t see me up in one of those wookatook hoorang fucking things ever again, you won’t.”

Ian McDormant has been flying on Nappatunga Station, a short 320-minute drive northeast of The Advocate’s Daroo St offices, for close to two years know and he agrees with the notion that if a sprightly young ringer tells a pilot that they haven’t been up in a chopper before, they’re obligated to scare the shit out of them.

Taking long draws from his filterless Log Cabin, the 27-year-old skyboy said taking blokes like young Michael up for a spin is what keeps his love for aviation burning.

“You should’ve seen the look on his face,” said Ian.

“You can tell when a bloke is really, truly scared. They don’t scream or flail about like some lunatic, they freeze and hold onto their seatbelt like their life depends on it,”

“Can only go it when the boss is away, but. If you get caught flying like a fuckhead, the manager will drag you out of that chopper and jump on you quicker than you can say, ‘Sikorsky.'”

Endorphin Levels Explode Inside Man’s Brain As He Runs For Train – And Makes It

TEXT:

Thanks to repeated budget cuts and staff layoffs, the service on the Betoota MetroLine has continued to slip.

Which is why many people like Ahmed Pendergast feel compelled to run to catch a train if they see one, rather than wait for the next service and spare themselves the embarrassment of running in public.

But it doesn’t always end well.

“I’ve run for trains and just missed them before,” said the 29-year-old literary agent.

“The feeling is horrible, knowing you’ve put all that effort it. To run in dress shoes and everything. Only to be left huffing and puffing on the platform,”

“Left huffing and puffing with a 20-minute wait ahead of you. But today I made it and the feeling is incredible.”

This morning, Ahmed noticed on the timetable board as he was walking down the front steps of the Betoota Ponds Terminus that he only had a minute or two to be on the platform.

A stiff breeze was already blowing up the stairs from the platform.

“I broke into a frenzied sprint,” he said.

“Down the steps to the platform like Fred Astaire and I burst into the train carriage like Jona Lomu running over Mike Catt in the 1995 World Cup,”

“The doors snapped shut behind me. The train guard tried to ruin my day but I fucking won. I made eyes with everyone else in the carriage and they smiled back. Today is going to be a good day.”

Pub Regulars Agree They Should At Least Cross The Street Before Lighting Up Dirty Bunger

TEXT:

A bunch of old boys that have settled in for an afternoon session at the Lord Kidman Hotel in Betoota have started to get that tingling feeling they used to get every weekend in the 70s.

Upon learning that one of the old fellas, Roy, has a little bit of Riverina Rollie stashed in his coat, the old codgers make their way outside to have a smoke.

Initially attempting to play off that they are just about to puff on some regular tobacco, the regulars conclude that because they look suspicious because they are passing the joint around puff-for-puff.

“Shit” says Angus.

“We should cross the street at least”

Despite the fact that every member of staff and every patron currently located within twenty metres of the pub’s front door are aware of what they are doing, the old fellas decide to walk a whopping eight paces out of the pub’s duty of care, so as to not burden them with their recreational drug use.

“Not bad this stuff” says Rod, while exhaling and passing it to Chester.

“Really takes me back. Where’d you get it, old boy?”

Rod says his nephew has gone off the rails of late and always seems to have a little bit of smoke floating around.

“Jeez I hope they don’t realise inside” says Chester.

“I need a beer. I’m drying up in the mouth”

Rod giggles.

“Aha the Winnie green will do that to ya”

“Europe, With Her”: Man Vomits Into Mouth Reading Title Of Friend’s Latest Facebook Photo Album

TEXT:

“Give me a fucking break,” he said.

“That’ll just about do me, it will. I’ve seen enough.”

Those are the sentiments of Ben Geurie, a South Betoota town planner who’s bared witness to his school mate’s relationship with another local girl hit a big milestone – the first holiday together.

Taking off just last week, Brett Hannaman and his girlfriend of two months, Denise Pot, have enjoyed a well earned period of rest as they galavant around the European continent.

“What’s a trip overseas without three or four hundred photos published to social media?” asked Geurie.

“It’s nothing, that’s what it is. But this; this just takes the whole plate of party pies and throws it in the bin.”

What the 27-year-old is referring to is the title of Brett’s latest photo album he uploaded to Facebook.

Letting out a deep groan before repeating the name for our reporters, Ben wanted The Advocate to know he feels a physical cringing pain deep inside himself each time he says it.

“Europe, With Her,” he said, head buried in his hands.

“I mean, come the fuck on, Bridget. Grow up would you? Nobody wants to see that cringe shit. We all get it, you’re obsessed with each other. Stop ramming your love down my throat, it’s gross.”

However, Ben said he would stop short of unfriending and unfollowing the pair, explaining that the associated fallout from that would outweigh the reward.

“I fucking hate social media. All of it. I wish I never got involved in it. Dad was right, I should’ve been a farmer.”

Flashbacks Of Conversation With Boss Yesterday Riddle Local Man With Anxiety

TEXT:

Though he can remember talking to his boss yesterday, Dylan Potter can’t remember what they talked about.

Recently, the 26-year-old property manager has been thinking about his future more and where he’d like to be in five years time.

Those thoughts were prompted by a discussion last week he had with his boss, who asked him where he saw himself in the future.

“In my head, I thought, ‘In your chair, mate’,” he said.

“Fuck, I hope I didn’t say that to his face. Shit, I was pissed. A few blokes at the afterparty asked us what we were talking about for so long and I can’t for the life of me remember. He’s a bit of a cricket nut so I can only hope it was about the Ashes selections and whatnot. Fuck my life,”

“If I go in today and everyone looks at me as soon as I walk in, I’ll just turn around, leave and find another job.”

In the interests of journalistic balance and integrity, shortly after speaking to The Advocate regarding his general mood this morning, our reporters made contact with Mr Potter’s boss to discuss the very conversation he was worried about.

However, like Dylan, his boss Gary Peg cannot remember what they spoke about either.

“To be honest, I don’t even remember seeing young Dylan yesterday,” said Gary.

“And to be even more honest, I don’t really remember who he is or what he looks like. But you say he’s anxious about what he said? Jesus Christ, everybody feels like that today,”

“You get an office full of people on the turps for 12 hours and think it’ll end with handshakes and backslaps? Give me a break.”

Understaffed Bank Branch Not Even Trying With The Refreshments

TEXT:

The twenty or so people backed up in the waiting area of a local DMB branch have today realised how unimportant they are in the minds of their chosen financial institution.

Diamantina Maranoa Bank is well known across the greater Betoota regiona as one of the few banks that assume every single one of their customers has the time and technological know-how to do all of their banking on a poorly formatted netbank program.

Local publican, Paddy Johnson has been waiting for thirty-six minutes in the ‘marshalling area’ which only has twelve seats in it, meaning anyone under the age of 80 has to stand. He is clutching an envelope that holds $8000 in TAB and pokie takings.

He knows he could be here much longer than the one hour lunch break he has allowed himself.

“Guess I’m not going to be able to squeeze in some Japanese” he says.

“The refreshments table isn’t too flash ever”

With a fake ceramic bowl containing two individually wrapped tropical mentos lollies, a stack of 34 plastic cups and a lukewarm thermos of tap water, it is quite clear to Paddy and the other plebeians waiting for the attention of one of the two bank tellers, that they don’t mean shit.

“I mean they could have at least put a water cooler in here” he says Paddy.

“That’s the only way they could justify having cups that small”

With the two lollies looking right at him, Paddy knows he’s going to have to miss out and let some kids that have been dragged by their mother fight over them.

Man Catches Himself Thinking About His Dog Again

TEXT:

For the fourth time this morning, a beloved local dentist has paused to think about his pawed best friend at home all alone.

Dr Dennis Waugh walked out of his French Quarter medical practice late this morning to enjoy a brisk walk around the block in between patients, when he suddenly caught himself thinking about his placid three-year-old Golden Collie, Jake.

“God I love that dog,” he said, looking out at the treetops along Jardin Du Putain.

“I wonder what he’s up to now? He’s been at home alone all morning. My wife is down in Brisbane on a short holiday with her girlfriends and Jake is there by himself, probably wondering where everyone is.”

“God’s sake, I need to get it together. I’ve got fifteen more people to see before I go home this afternoon.”

Wanting to put the 55-year-old’s mind at ease, our reporter paid a visit to Mr Waugh’s Betoota Heights home on the way back to the office this morning.

There, The Advocate spent some time tapping on the front window and barking back at Jake before throwing a pig’s ear over the back fence.

Former Gambling Addict Wondering How All Of This Shit Is Still Legal

TEXT:

Feeling confident in his newfound ability to control his impulses, a popular North Betoota account director has sat in the pub down the road from his office this afternoon and repeatedly recoiled in disgust.

Life wasn’t as rosy as it is now for Brett Dearmoth.

Just two short years ago, he was left destitute as a terrible gambling addiction took hold of his life and refused to let go.

The 28-year-old was forced to move back into the family home with his ageing parents, who worked hard through retirement to help their son get back on his feet.

But that was then.

Now the Betoota Dolphins third grade captain has paid off his debts and has control of his life once again, plus a career in one of the area’s most successful public relations firms.

He spoke briefly to The Advocate about the day.

“I can’t believe all this shit is still legal, it’s fucking disgusting,” he said.

“It’s just so predator, especially for blokes like me. Here I am down the Glock & Spiel Hotel with my mates from work, trying to have a good time on Cup day and I’ve had all this betting advertising just spewed at me all afternoon,”

“It’s hard enough for a bloke like me to have a couple of beers and keep out of the Tatts, let alone have the ability to have sixty fucking betting accounts in my pocket. It should be illegal and so should this whole sport, turn these vast expanses of lawn into flats. Eat the rich!”

Mr Dearmoth then took a deep breath and asked our reporter if he’d like to continue the interview in the smoking area.

Office IT Worker Resists Repeated Calls To Join Office Party

Despite being all-but dragged from his post, a local IT worker has resisted the urge to call pens down on his duties this afternoon and join the office party in the next room.

Mohan Patel, a 27-year-old system engineer at South Betoota Polytech, told The Advocate that his responsibilities to the campus’ technology infrastructure ends at 5 o’clock, not noon.

“I am the only one here from my department, what if something goes wrong?” he asked.

“But my colleagues from the other staff groups keep trying to drag me off into the party. I cannot party when there are responsibilities. IT workers are supposed to be invisible until something goes wrong. What if it all crashes when I’m three sheets to the wind?”

“Nothing, I tell you. Nothing! There would be chaos. Chaos that I am responsible for to fix. Thank you, but no thank you. I take my job very seriously. I will watch the race but I will not part take in the rampant consumption of drugs and alcohol that seems to have swept through this office like a grass fire! I’m about to lock the door.”

One of those attempting to beckon Mr Patel from the server room is Becky Longhurst, a popular receptionist and cashier at the learning institution.

She told our reporters that she’s made many trips into see Mohan this afternoon.

“Nobody should be working on Melbourne Cup day!” she said.

“I feel sorry for Mohan. We’re all getting pissed and carrying on in the room over and he’s in here tap-tap-tapping away on his little keyboard all by himself, it’s sad!”

“But he won’t stop working. I supposed somebody has to do some work around here.”

Disorientated Baby Boomer Hails Bus To Ask Bus Driver If This Is The Right Bus

TEXT:

Lost and frightened on the edge of town, a Betoota Heights sexagenarian began to panic.

Marrion Rhiannon, a popular interior designer and art curator, found herself outside a textile factory in the outer south-eastern suburbs of the Betoota City Limits this morning without any means of getting herself back to her French Quarter offices.

What’s typically a short 20-minute drive, the 62-year-old recently lost her licence after a long seafood lunch at the Royal Diamantina Club and was forced to take a taxi.

However, none of the town’s 17 licenced taxis would take the booking as many of them have been burnt heading out there only to find nobody there.

“So I hailed the first bus that came past,” she said.

“I glanced at the timetable but I couldn’t make sense of all that gibberish. I haven’t caught a bus in years and I just had to get my bearings.”

Mrs Rhiannon stopped the 9:23 am 481 to Betoota Grove without any intention whatsoever to board it – she just had to be sure it wasn’t going where she needed to go.

Darcy Overell flicked on the blinker and jibed the big blue and white Volvo into the bus lane and opened the door for the flighty Virgo, only for her to begin bombarding him with questions as soon as the vehicle came to a halt.

“Are you going to the French Quarter, darling?” she asked.

“Ah nah. Kind of. I go down Harvey Avenue to Buckland then head up the hill to the Grove. It’s a little bit of a walk…”

Marrion interjected.

“Yes I know where that is, I’m just asking you if you’re going to the French Quarter because that’s where I need to go!”

Darcy smiled back, his tie dancing in the breeze.

“You’d be better off waiting for a 420. That goes to the French Quarter via the O’Hay Quay. It shouldn’t be too long.”

With that, Marrion alighted from the bus and the doors swung shut and the good people of Betoota Ponds were back on their journey into town.

Inner-City Leftie Prepares Self For Annual Care About Equine Welfare Day

TEXT:

As the gambling addicted, court suit-wearing, fascinator-adoring men and women of Australia prepare themselves for the most important sickie of the year tomorrow, there’s one corner of the Australian online community preparing themselves for a different kind of day out.

And that is, one spent entirely indoors, keyboard at the ready, to let the world at large know that horse racing is evil, and anyone who supports it should see what it’s like to wear a saddle and be whipped accordingly

And while confining the airing of equine-related grievances to that fateful first  Tuesday of November has had little to no impact in the past, Betoota resident Jane Oaksfield is one of literally dozens who aren’t going to let the previous few years of mostly ignored hashtag-fuelled Facebook statuses slow her down.

“Enough is enough,” Oaksfield began via messenger to the Advocate earlier today, taking a break from dusting off last year’s soapbox in preparation for tomorrow’s social media bombardment.

“It’s time this country stood up and acknowledged this evil industry for the blood thirsty sport that it is.”

When asked on why the other 364 days of the year have been horse issue-free on #KONY2012 and the #IceBucketChallengeas personal online activism victories) insisted social issues are only relevant when people are paying slightly more attention to something than the usual zero interest every other day.

“I’m not sure if you understand how hashtags work,” she scoffed.

“But unless an issue is trending, there is no point in vocalising your problems, because otherwise how else are my like-minded brethren going to hear what I have to say about this particular issue at this particular time”<

When quizzed on whether she could wholeheartedly say she had never attended a race-day as young woman, before she became so invested in the trending issues of virtue-signallers, Cooper declined further comment.

PARADISE PAPERS: Local Worker On $54k Explores His Possible Tax Haven Options

TEXT:

In previous years, Michael Dooley has happily defrauded the Australian Tax Office with petty deductions regarding his laundry and business attire.

Once or twice, he even claimed his own private phone was actually the device he used for work.

But in recent times, that hasn’t been enough for the 24-year-old logistics manager – he wants to pay even less tax.

Reading through the explosive ‘Paradise Papers’ this morning, he was shocked to learn that he pays more tax in Australia than many transnational businesses such as Airbnb, Google, Apple and Microsoft.

Fed up with having to pay way more than his fair share, Dooley told The Advocate this morning via Skype that he’s had enough.

“I’m exploring my possible tax options,” he said.

“The boss and I are having a meeting this afternoon regarding my payment situation. I bet she thinks I’m after a raise or something but I’m going to ask her if she can start paying me via an offshore account,”

“Because why should I have to pay more tax than a billion-dollar company? Give me one good reason why and I’ll do it. I’ll write a cheque to the ATO right now. Until then, I’ll be looking to move my finances to either Malta, Bermuda or Jersey. I’ve had enough of this shit.”

However, much to the frugal Libra’s chagrin, the tax office recently announced they’re clamping down on international companies failing to meet their tax obligations in Australia. A ‘bullshit, smoke and mirrors move’ according to Dooley, who says he’s already making progress in Bermuda.

“I’ll be moving up to Betoota Grove soon enough, I’ll be rich enough not to pay tax by the time I’m 30 I reckon.”

Three-hundred-and-sixty-four-days-a-year, David Gardner works hard earns an honest pay.

He works closely with builders and other tradesmen, picking the things up they don’t need on the site before breaking it up and throwing it in a skip bin.

The 27-year-old is a self-described simple man with simple needs.

But tomorrow, he lets himself go.

“Melbourne Cup is basically Christmas in November,” he said.

“I’ve saved up for weeks and visiting the ‘Tash with my missus, she picked out this tidy green number for the big day. I’m going to fucking LOSE my mind tomorrow. Got my gear getting dropped off tonight. That was the biggest expense,”

“Saved up for a ticket to the Dolphins Club Offical Afterparty. Sneaky Sound System is playing, I’m fucking pumped, mate. Should a be a belter.”

Denise Petersen from Tarocash’s flagship local store in Betoota Ponds has confirmed that the reasonably priced men’s retailer has been doing a roaring trade in the lead up to the nation’s day of days.

Along with brightly-coloured suits and white-rimmed sunglasses, Petersen said they’re also on the verge of running out of white faux-leather belts and white faux-leather loafers.

“It’s bedlam down here at the moment,” she said.

“There are two gentlemen here now with neck tattoos fighting over the last pinstripe sports coat. One woman even used her leashed dog like a bommy knocker, throwing it against another young lady attempting to buy the last of the hair weaves,”

Government Initiative Sees DVD Markets Replace NBN, Netflix In Regional Areas

TEXT:

Describing herself as a simple woman with simple pleasures, Denise Coleman doesn’t like complaining about things out of her control.

The popular local warhorse has time and time again called on the government to provide a stable, usable internet connection to her Mankey Valley donga – but has received no answer.

Until now.

This morning, the 39-year-old grader driver got word that in the interim, she and her fellow Betoota City Limit dwelling neighbours will be given first dibs at a local used DVD sale organised by NBNco.

“It’s progress,” admits Tim Dawson, the NBN’s representative in the Diamantina region.

“We know that all these hillbillies want in life is a steady job, a roof over their head, a bowl of piping hot potato gems lathered in smokey BBQ sauce and movies without a plot,”

“With the advent of Netflix, Stan and the like, it’s been easier find entertainment after a long day shooting local cats with a clapped-out air rifle – which I understand is a popular local pastime. However, with current technology, we can’t deliver video streaming to these remote parts of the area.  Until we can, we will provide DVDs and bags of frozen Hors-d’oeuvres.”

But that’s no good according to Coleman, who says she can’t browse the internet on her DVD player.

Speaking to our reporter through the screen door of her humble home, Denise said that she’s sick and tired of being treated like a second-class citizen by NBNco and the powers at be.

“How am I supposed to abuse my enemies on the Betoota Buy, Swamp, Sell, Trade n Free Facebook page?” she said.

“I always go over my data, then I have to call up Vodaphone and give them a spray for fucking me over again, even though we all know it’s my fault.”

Smashing Labels: This Blogger Doesn’t Identify With Any Hogwarts House

TEXT:

Tumblr has been rocked by blogger D’Arcy Sunmarin (27) who has not only set the internet ablaze with her Harry Potter blog (The Half-Blood Queen) but her stance in not identifying with any Hogwarts House.

“People say I’m brave for having my stance but that doesn’t make me a Gryffindor, lol.”

While many Harry Potter fanatics (such as Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews) take pride in the house they choose when purchasing merchandise, Sunmarin sees the houses as more of a spectrum and rejects the idea of being locked into one box.

“You know sometimes I’m just a bit of a Hufflepuff, just cruising through life with my besties, working hard still. But I want to make it to the top so I’m also like a Slytherin. You don’t get 2,000 followers sitting on your ass!”

“And I love books so I’m also a bit of a Ravenclaw! I seriously love books, even The Cursed Child!”

Not everyone in the Harry Potter community has thrown their support behind Sunmarin stating she should grow up and find out her house using the Pottermore online test like everyone else.

Sunmarin states while she is affronted by these comments, she deals with hate like this on a regular basis.

“The Gryffindor in me gets quite snappy when I hear stuff like this.”

“What they have to realise is that the Pottermore Sorting Hat test fails to take so much into account details such as seeded ethos, family history and attitude under pressure. That test probably would have sorted Malfoy into Hufflepuff!”

Online disagreements aside, Sunmarin is happy to be a spokesperson for Potterheads who don’t identify with any house.

“I just want to get back to writing about the real issues such as what would have happened if a Slytherin house champion was pulled from the Goblet of Fire and whether anything was going on between Dean Thomas and Seamus Finnigan.”

“I’m kicking goals! Ten points to…me!”

Popular Local Chef Sacked After Being Caught Working Sober

In breaking news, Betoota East chef Henry Leonards (34) was immediately terminated from Cafe Eats earlier today, following the revelation that he had been preparing food completely sober.

“Unacceptable. How am I meant to trust a chef who turns up to work like that? How do I even know he’s awake?”

Cafe Eats owner Wayne Guthrie (50) said he took a punt on Henry as a chef, even though he has no visible tattoos and only smokes socially.

“I’m not having it here. Showing up to work like that honestly. Probably didn’t even go out drinking last night before smashing some bongs in bed. These new chefs man, no clue.”

While disappointed in his former employer’s decision, Leonards is taking his termination in his stride.

“Wayne is a weird guy anyway. Whenever I sniffed he always touched his nose and winked at me like we were part of a secret club. Anytime I had a coffee he would say ‘Aw, big night you old snake!’”

Leonards admits he was partial to drug use earlier in his career but has relaxed his intake in recent years stating that eight hours of sleep a night and some light exercise is a healthier way to remain energised enough to cook a couple of vege-stacks or smoked salmon omelettes.

“For some reason, he (Guthrie) couldn’t seem to wrap his head around the idea that I can work without being geared up. For fuck’s sake, you don’t need to be smacked off your tits on goey to make a big breakfast out of mostly frozen ingredients.”

Shame Strangely Absent From Local Student’s Mid-Week Walk Of Shame

TEXT:

Cutting through the grounds of Betoota National University this morning, one local student on a walk of shame paused to ask himself what was so shameful about what he was doing.

John Greenholm, a third-year philosophy student, went along to see the Turkish Drill Pressers last night at the Dolphin’s Club and by all reports had a great time.

Another concert-goer, Francine Maitland, also had a great time.

The fifth-year Arts student and John knew of each other through friends but hadn’t had the time to properly acquaint themselves properly.

As it turns out, they only needed 60 minutes, half a dozen white wines and some a terrible local punk band.

According to John’s group chat, he ended up back at Ms Maitland’s dorm room shortly before midnight and played a cracking late cut between third slip and gully.

Greenholm claims he left Francine’s college room at around 7 this morning, taking the frost off the grass as he took a shortcut over the oval.

He was on a walk of shame – but that emotion was far from the front of his mind.

“I shared Francine’s Instagram handle to the group and they all gave me great feedback. I’m on top of the world,” he said.

“Why do they call it a walk of shame? I literally just finished having the life chonged out of me and now I’m heading back to my place to have a shower and eat Pop Tarts on the couch all day. I’m actually having the perfect day so far,”

“The feelings of shame that typically accompany situations like this is strangely absent.”

Despite Having Decorative Shoes Over His Power Lines, Local Man Is Not Dealing Drugs Out Of His House

Once or twice a week, Miles Keith answers an unsolicited knock on the door.

Only a handful of times, it’s been a salesman.

Last week, a Jehovah’s Witness dropped by for a cup of tea and an Iced Vovo.

Sadly, most of the time the Betoota Grove resident answers the door, it’s somebody looking for drugs.

“The look on their faces when I tell them there’s no heroin here is heartbreaking,” he said.

“Then they ask me, ‘But Miles, why do you have a pair of sneakers thrown over your power lines? Why?’ and I have to tell them the truth. They’re decorative. I enjoy the aesthetic, it lets me feel like the area I’m living in isn’t quite gentrified yet,”

“It’s still a bit edgy – like a youth might still wave a knife at you down at the metro station and demand your phone and wallet. Something like that anyway. I still carry a length of reo bar up my sleeve at night in case I need to bop some hoodlum on the head in self-defence, or just for the thrill of it!”

The Advocate reached out to members of the Betoota community who say they’re addicted to hard drugs for comment.

Our reporter’s calls were answered by a young gentleman who only refers to himself in the third person and goes by the name of Mouse.

Taking time out of his busy morning of lying in a local park, Mouse said he’s often fooled by the old shoes over the power line trope.

“Back in the day, back in the 90s, you could walk the streets until you found a house with a pair of shoes over the power lines and walk right up to the door and ask for drugs,” he said.

“Nowadays, you’ve got all these yuppies who do it for the look, so the area still looks grungy. Being a smack head is head enough in the Simpson Desert. People who do this type of thing only make my life harder than it has to be,”

“Even the police are more helpful. The only time I head up to Betoota Grove these days is to mug some private school kid, take his phone and laptop to a hock shop then inject myself with a bit of Mother’s milk. The area used to be much edgier. Ah well.”

Local Homebrewer Reckons His First Ever Batch Of Pale Ale Is The Best He’s Tasted

Receiving the homebrewing kit for his birthday in August, one local waterproofer turned brewmaster got to sample his first batch this today after weeks of toil.

And the results are in: it’s the best beer he’s ever tasted.

“My uncle Tim is an avid homebrewer and I told him over Christmas that I was considering getting into it as piss costs a bomb these days,” said the 26-year-old.

“So he sent over one of his old brew kits for my birthday a few months ago and next thing I know, I’m making beer in my laundry! Tim also send a Coopers Pale Ale kit that comes with all the instructions and everything on the back,”

“I didn’t follow them to a tee, I definitely went a bit freestyle on the recipe. Like they said to keep it in a cool, dry place. Well, it sat atop my dryer the whole time so it was hot, damp and full of lint. Still, the yeast took and it fermented.”

However, it wasn’t all smooth sailing for the convicted car radio theif.

As he quickly ran out of bottles when he began bottling the wort about a month ago, Monk was forced to use everything from half-empty Mountain Dew bottles to his housemates SodaStream.

“You see, the combination happens inside the bottle. The sugar you put in the bottle turns into bubbles. But we couldn’t wait for weeks, so we put some in the SodaStream to see what happened. It was messy but fun,”

“To cut a long story short, the finished product is going to make me rich. It’s the best beer I’ve ever had.”

Order Betoota Bitter from Dan Murphy’s today and it’ll be there before you know it.

Report: Nobody Quite Sure Why Small TV In Local Pub Plays Extreme Sports On Loop

TEXT:

A damning report into the local hospitality industry has outlined a number of shocking shortcomings – including the fact that nobody knows why each licensed premises in the wider Betoota area has a small television playing extreme sports clips on repeat.

Peter Godwin, from the Office of Alcohol and Gaming, handed down his findings today to the local shire council.

“Not one bar owner or manager was able to tell me how and why they have said televisions in their places of business,” said Godwin.

“One owner I spoke to said he opened up the pub one day and the TV was just there. He couldn’t explain why or how it ended up there. But he enjoyed having clips of wingsuit flyers and skydivers playing on repeat as it made his establishment look sporty and sexy,”

“He seemed to not be concerned by any other issues, such as why in the hell these televisions even exist in the first place and why they’re in his pub. Madness. Not a single person involved in the Betoota hospitality scene could articulately explain them.”

Wanting to get to the bottom of the issue, or reporters made contact with a number of bar owners and managers around The Advocate’s Old City district offices.

What they found was nothing short of shocking.

Sam Willett, manager of The Old Cuck & Hold Hotel across the street from the newsroom, said he knows why the televisions exist – but he’s got no idea how they ended up there.

“There are companies that pay to advertise shit on them, like Red Bull and shit,” he said.

“We advertise shit on them as well, like our Trivia Nights and badge draws. But yeah, the extreme sports and shit is there to catch people’s eyes. Seeing a cunt jump off a cliff and fly between a row of trees is pretty eye-catching. Then pow, an ad,”

“You don’t have to be a smart man to work that one out. Always follow the money. Anyway fellas, cheers.”

Standoff Begins Between Bus Driver And Whoever Pushed The Button But Isn’t Getting Off

TEXT:

Once a Gurkha unsheathes his kukri, he must draw blood with it – even if it’s his own.

The same can be said for a bus driver.

Once somebody pushed the stop button and the bus pulls over, somebody must get off.

This morning on the D64 Express from Betoota Ponds to the Royal Zoological Park on Dalhasse Boulevard, that exact situation happened.

Outside Mojo Advertising’s French Quarter bureau office on Gurner Road, Diamantina MetroLink driver, Walter Collen, steered the bus into the transit lane and came to a stop.

The doors swung open and Collen looked up into the rear vision mirror.

Nobody moved and not a word was spoken – just silence.

The 39-year-old’s eyes darted up and down the aisle as every passenger on the big blue Mercedes pretended they weren’t the one responsible.

Without saying a word, Walter closed the doors and muttered to himself. Flicking the indicator and punting the bus back out into the morning peak hour traffic.

He spoke to The Advocate a short time ago at the Teeta Bus Depot as he waited for his next shift by to begin.

“I fucking hate it when people do that shit,” he said, sipping a long black while he enjoyed a Dunhill.

“Sometimes it can be a real pain in the arse getting the bus over two lanes of traffic and then into a stop, only for some fucking coward to push the button a stop too soon,”

“I get these dreams from time to time where I just turn the bus off and wait until somebody fesses up. Like full-on get the newspaper out and have my feet up on the dash. Fuck these people, mate. I’m my own man.”

As for now, all the necktied Capricorn can do is dream of the day when he can do that.

Because all he can do now is smile and say thank you for choosing Diamantina MetroLink.

Nonna Betrays Grandchildren With Frozen Tomato Sauce In Ice Cream Container

TEXT:

A local grandson has been distraught to learn that the blue tub in his nonna’s freezer is actually just rock-frozen tomato sauce, not the neapolitan ice cream he was expecting.

After being given free licence on his maternal grandmother’s fridge, the 7-year-old went straight to the freezer to sauce for frozen treats that nonna sometimes buys after seeing ads on the television.

“Oh there’s ice cream in here” shouts Richard, a prominent junior soccer player at South Betoota Primary.

What happened next broke the third-generation Italian-Australian boy’s heart.

“Oh man! I had the milo out and everything. This is disgusting”

Nonna responds by saying her grandson does not need ice cream, but urged him to pass her that container as she was going to heat it up anyway.

“You look hungry? You hungry!?” she says.

The practice of freezing tomato sauce is a common practice in post-war migrant communities, as the nation’s nonnas are known as prolific over-cookers, who assume each one of their grandchildren will consume three servings at each meal.

Last year, it was revealed that the nation’s nonnas don’t give a fuck if you ate earlier, after a 30-something man was forced to eat another dinner at 10:30 pm after visiting his grandparents in North-NSW.

Local Scotsman Horrifies New Australian Pals With Buckfast-Related Yarns

TEXT:

Joe Cranston-MacDougall has carved his own groove in Australia, according to friends and family back home.

The popular science student turned hospitality guru turned footballing actor has embraced Australian life like his very life depended on it. Rarely does he look back at old photos of the grey Aberdeen granite and wish he was back there throwing rocks at buses like he did as a youth.

However, there’s one thing he does miss – something his new Australian pals will never understand.

From time to time, the 27-year-old gets the thirst.

Not for a cold, refreshing schooner down at his local French Quarter pub, Le Grenouille et Pamplemousse on Rue de Branlette.

Not for a chilled glass of Rockhampton Rose.

Not even a sparkling glass of red.

The thirst that Joe cannot seem to quench Down Under is his thirst for Buckfast, a caffeine-enriched tonic wine that’s garnered a cult-like status among Scotland’s most reprehensible scallywags.

Joe’s new mates were initially entertained by his Buckfast-related stories of misspent youth and needless property destruction but their laughs were quickly quelled by sheer horror.

“Mate, if you could get Bucky down here in Australia, the whole fucken joint’d be in flames,” said Joe.

“Aye, everybody knows you Aussies take the piss out of any liberty a government will give you. I cannot even begin to imagine the state of the place would be in if you mad bastards were allowed to pick up half a box of Bucky from your local Tescos or something,”

“I’m tellin ya, lad. It’s basically unfermented grape juice, like fucken Ribena or something. Sugary as all shite. Then they fortify it with pure ethanol and add it a fuck ton of caffeine for good measure. Pure madness man. We’d have a coupla cans and a bottle of bucky and up’d roll a riot van moments later. Shit’d put ye in a trance or something like,”

Friend Michael, a born and bread Betootanese builder, asked Joe what it’s like to drink and what was the dumbest thing he’d done while under its spell.

“Mate, it’s like getting jumped with a defibrillator or something, putting a fork in a power socket. Hearts just racin’. Dumbest thing like? Probably put my da’s Opel backward through a shopfront one night with the fellas, up come the polis van an missed us by a bawhair. Got away but. Mad. Never again like.”

Michael looked over at this two other friends and nodded in agreement.

“Yeah. Sounds like something we could get around, though,” said Michael.

“Do you have any here?”

Joe smiled and finished the rest of his pint.

“Aye, pal. Lettuce retire to my flat and I’ll tell you all about it.”

Betoota French Quarter detectives are seeking information regarding the whereabouts of Mr Cranston-MacDougall and his friends.

Joe is described as light skinned, approximately 180cm tall, with a slim build and fair hair.

The 27-year-old man could be in possession of a collection of rocks handy enough to be thrown at traffic and if sighted, members of the public should not approach him but call Police immediately.

Anyone with information regarding the whereabouts of this Joe is asked to call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or report it online at www.crimestoppers.com.au

Not Again: Local Woman’s Blind Date Turns Out To Be A Muggle

TEXT:

Yet another cosmopolitan was sighed heavy into at Romano’s Club last night as Molly Rawlins realised the man her friends set her up with is ‘just another muggle.’

Stopping short of declaring herself as a wizard, the 25-year-old finance worker said she uses the term ‘muggle’ to describe people that aren’t like her and her friends.

A popular spot for first dates, Romano’s (which sits atop the Betoota Dolphins Leagues Club on Medusa Avenue) offers great discounts on food and beverages as well as trivia on Monday nights – which is why Rawlins suggested it in the first place.

“I like to organise these things on trivia nights, so I can get a good gauge on how cluey a bloke is,” she said.

“But aside from getting almost everything wrong and not really wanting to talk about anything other than himself, I came to the conclusion early on the piece that my date was a bit of a muggle,”

“He’s nice and fairly harmless but he’s a big old cup of milky tea. People who put milk in their tea should be lobotomized. It’s disgusting. Last night makes me question whether my friends ”

However, the grass was much greener on Matthew Wallis’ side of the trivia fence.

Jumping at the opportunity to spend an evening with Ms Rawlins, the same-aged architectural student said he enjoyed her company and that she was ‘very clever’.

But he stopped short of saying he’d like to see her again.

“She’s really intimidating,” he said.

“Like, I’d try to say something or suggest another thing and she’d just raise her eyebrows and say, ‘cool’. Maybe she thinks I’m a bit of a muggle?”

“And the trivia night was a bad idea, I should’ve have agreed to that. I’ve been in university for 6 years, how much do you think I know about the real world? Nothing!”

Morning Commute Ruined Thanks To Coworker That Wants To Chat

TEXT:

Walking briskly this morning down Ulster Street to the Morris Road Metro Station in the fabled Old City District, Sally Dawkins casually rifled through her bag looking for her headphones for the ride to work.

However, she didn’t know that that today, she wouldn’t be needed them.

Jamming herself into the third-last carriage, the 29-year-old systems analyst came devastatingly close to putting her headphone in when a co-worker, Denise Carmichael, tapped her on the shoulder.

“Can you literally believe what just happened yesterday at that meeting? Crazy, huh? Can’t believe they’re going through with the merger,” she said.

“What’s the feeling in systems? Is the team ready for the change or are you doing to go back to the partners with a bit of a contingency plan until we know the hard facts?”

There was no feeling in the systems department. Not one that Dawkins was party to anyway.

Most of what Denise had just said to her hadn’t stuck – it hadn’t stuck because it was 7:07 am on a Tuesday morning.

“Ha, yeah. We’ll see what everyone thinks this morning and go from their,” replied Sally.

“I didn’t get time to read the proposal yesterday afternoon, I had a 4:45 call to the Quilpie office and yeah, just got on the train.”

To her abject horror, that wasn’t enough of a response to inoculate her colleague.

From there, the conversation shifted to their personal lives despite neither of them really knowing each other that well.

“She didn’t take any hints, she just kept talking about how her ex is trying to win custody over the dog,” she said.

“Then she told me more personal details, so I got off a stop early before the park.”

Dawkins then told The Advocate that she just got rained on and accosted by a tramp in Remienko Park, which ruined the high from her pre-breakfast jog.

Local Acting School Director Agrees Everybody Has What It Takes To Make It In Hollywood

TEXT:

Have you ever dreamed about leaving this four-horse-town, trading the cosmopolitan late night cafe culture in Betoota’s French Quarter district from the glitz and glamour of Hollywood?

The director of a local acting school, Dennis Ridgeway, can help make those dreams a reality.

For close to a decade now, Star Dreemz on Montague Street Betoota Grove, has serviced the wider community and made people from all walks of life realise their dreams to be a star.

“There’s something in everyone,” he said.

“It doesn’t matter what you look like or how much natural talent you have. Everybody has their own ‘X-Factor’ inside them and it’s my job to help people discover that,”

“Many of my students have gone on to great careers. Both here and overseas. Look at all the familiar faces up on the wall. This is a dream factory where we come together to not only dream but to build on those dreams like a construction worker. It takes years of dedication to graduate from Star Dreemz.”

Years of dedication… and bags of money, says one disgruntled former student.

Amy Bachmann, who claims to have spent close to $25 000 and two years at the acting academy, only received an inkjet-printed certificate and a personal guarantee from Ridgeway that she’d never make it to Hollywood as she left the Star Dreemz programme prematurely.

She plans to expose Dennis for who he really is – a conman.

“Have you heard of Sanford Meisner? Yeah, neither had I before I started at fucking Star Dreemz,” she said.

“If you hear that cunt’s name at an acting school, run. They have the classes at Star Dreemz divided up into year groups then beginner, intermediate and advanced classes. You basically have to wait until Dennis says you’re ready to jump up a grade while in the meantime, he milks your bank account dry,”

“He’s lucky he’s still got the use of his legs. The amount of people he’s ripped off over the years… he’s very lucky to be in the shape he’s in. If he was crossing the street in front of me, he’d be writhing in pain under my Volkswagen before he could say ‘Action!'”

Progress: This Boss Promotes Feminism By Hiring Women Who Can Hang With The Guys

TEXT:

In what might be one for the history books, the founder of local online gambling company, Murray Blackstock, is breaking down the industry’s sexist stereotypes by hiring women who can ‘hang with the guys.’

Blackstock’s company, BallerBets, is a rapidly growing Betootacone Valley gambling app, boasting a staff of nearly 50 – which now includes two female employees.

Something Blackstock is very proud of.

“It’s such a male-dominated industry and I thought it was time we get some ladies up in here. As long as they don’t mind a bit of the blue talk now and then hey!”

Taking great pride in his staff, the tech millionaire insists that while he does have a feminist focus, he also wants to find the best people, professionally and socially.

“You know, you always gotta find the right man for the job and in a few cases the right man turned out to be a chick. And not just any girls, they’re really cool you know? They don’t mind when the conversation gets a bit vulgar, which it always does!”

“Sam? She’s on reception. Bit of a friendly face which a lot of the legends here appreciate. There’s also Polly on graphic design, cool girl, understands sports you know?”

We reached out to graphic designer Polly Hagarty (24) to ask her opinion on her role as a woman in a male-dominated industry with a sexist history.

“Look, it’s really hard getting paid graphic design work. I’d work for Pauline Hanson if she paid me enough. Maybe the conversation would be a bit less filthy there.”

“They think I’m fine with it because I have two brothers and understand racing, but really I’m just putting up with this shit so I can pay my bills. And it’s not that fucking hard to understand the fastest horse is the one that wins!”

“What am I supposed to do, call them on their shit while they talk about all the disgusting shit they get up to over the weekend? I’ll finish the year out here and look somewhere else.”

Local Bloke With Violent Tendencies Minimizes Risk By Declaring Himself More Of A Bourbon Man

TEXT:

“I can’t drink rum,” said Gregor Donaldson.

“Rum makes me fight, it makes me violent. It’s a mug’s drink. Bourbon is my poison.”

The 29-year-old has a violent criminal record, despite his youthful looks and easy-going disposition.

Of a Saturday evening, he often starts his night with a few cleansing ales. One or two jugs of Toohey’s New and perhaps a naughty pineapple through Pelican Pete.

That’s fine, according to the V8 Supercar fan’s friends, he’s pleasant enough of the beers.

But when the split-personality Cancerian moves from the brews to the scrub chook [Wild Turkey] – that’s when things begin to go astray.

“He says he’s more of a bourbon man,” he said.

“But bourbon takes our friend Gregor away and replaces him with an extremely violent and verbally abusive person. You should hear some of the things he says under the influence of the corn liqour,”

“Not only that, if you go against him or anything. Even bump into him at the bar, he’ll take a swing at you. Mate, once he knocked this bloke out in the pokie den down the Dolphins Club for pretty much no reason, then he got knocked out. It’s madness.”

When asked whether he had violent tendencies, Gregor said he didn’t.

However, he admits that whenever he gets a rum or two in him, that changes.

“I tell people, don’t get me rum,” he said.

“Then they come back from the bar with rum and that’s all she wrote,”

“Nah, I’m more of a bourbon boy. Bourbon agrees with me.”

“We Voted To Protect The Sanctity Of Marriage!” Says Local Couple Enjoying Reruns Of Married At First Sight

TEXT:

Glenn Gilmore invited our reporters into his Betoota Grove serviced apartment this morning to set the record straight.

His third wife Margaret sets cucumber sandwiches down on the dining room table in front of us and adds milk to everyone’s tea without asking first.

“We don’t have it in for the QUILTBAG [Queer/Questioning, Undecided, Intersex, Lesbian, Trans (Transgender/Transsexual), Bisexual, Asexual, and/or Gay/Genderqueer] community,” said Glenn.

“Marriage to us is a definition set down by the Lord Himself. We have no qualms with the gay community receiving an equivalent legal bond under the eyes of the Commonwealth but to use a religious term when they don’t prescribe to a religious life isn’t appropriate.”

Margaret smiles and nods in agreement.

The retired nurse adds that marriage between a man and a woman is what the term marriage actually refers to and that allowing same-sex couples to essentially attach themselves ‘like a remora fish’ to common decency is an affront to Christianity.

“Marriage to us is very important,” she said.

“It needs to be protected and placed upon the high altar of love and respect. I could honestly go on for hours about this but I won’t bore you, sweetie. I can tell by your corduroy trousers and Pearl Jam shirt that the Yes campaign has already won you over.”

As 11 o’clock rolled around, our reporter was asked to leave as the couple’s favourite television show was about to begin.

Though it originally aired earlier this year and that the episode is saved in their Austar box, the pair often drop everything they’re doing whenever Married At First Sight comes in over the airwaves.

“I hope they can make it work,” they said.

Sam Cleary said he’d had a big weekend and that today he’s really feeling it.

“Had a coffee at 3 pm,” he said.

“And I didn’t have an essay due or anything, I just have a lot to do this afternoon. It might be a late one as well, so much on right now,”

“This is like, the most tired I’ve ever been in my life. Seriously, like I didn’t even get a good sleep last night after a huge weekend with the boys. Must be getting old!”

However, the 25-year-old student’s older sister laughed as soon as our reporters revealed the purpose of their call to her this afternoon.

Mother to a month old baby boy, Julie Denhert said her little brother Sam might be tired but he really doesn’t have any ‘fucking’ idea what it is to be truly exhausted.

Ms Denhert took time out of her busy afternoon to speak to The Advocate just a short time ago.

“He’s not tired, he doesn’t know what fucking tired is,” she said.

“I feel like I’ve transcended into a different dimension, I haven’t slept more than an hour or two in two months and I don’t know if what I’m experiencing is real life or some sort of dream sequence,”

“But yeah back to what I was saying. Are we still talking about Sam? He’s going well at university Mum reckons, which is great because he’s a smart kid with a lot of potentials. Not sure if real estate is his calling but he’s putting his out-going charisma to good use. Could you hang on? I’ve just got to go and turn the potatoes down, they’re boiling over.”

A crash was then heard as the phone slid off the bench and the line went dead.

Fed Up With All The Drama In Her Life, Small Town Woman Takes To Facebook And Vents

TEXT:

If you were to ask Sharnee Wilson if Taylor Sherk has been running her mouth about her all over town, you’d get a resounding yes.

Ask Taylor Sherk the same question about Sharnee and you’d get the same answer.

Until recently, the feud brewing between the brooding pair has remained between them and their closest friends as the battle lines were being drawn up.

Today is the day the ongoing conflict entered a new phase.

Sharnee took their mutual and deep-seeded loathing for each other online this morning in a Facebook post riddled with wild, criminal accusations, foul language and grammatic errors.

“A little berd [sic] has told my [sic] that @Sharnee Sharnee Wilson has been talkin shit about me behind my back. All smils [sic] to my face, bitch. dog behind it. ur nothin but a putrid dog. always ahs been always will be,” wrote Sharnee.

“Whatch you back, accidents happen for a RESON peace, don’t need this dramerin my life. I’m a bigger personm walking away.”

As the post began to rake in the likes and the supportive comments, Ms Sherk thought in pertinent to draft a reply.

Taking the moral high ground in the now-online argument, Taylor said she felt sad for the 27-year-old Betoota Ponds beauty therapist.

In a surprisingly detailed and uncomfortably threatening reply, Sherk explained exactly what she planned to do next.

“I’m not getting into this,” wrote Taylor.

“But if you continue with these sad threats of violence and intimidation, I’m going have to end it one way or another. If you can’t control you’re [sic] self, then get your affairs in order, bitch.”

Though Taylor’s post didn’t garner the dozen or so likes and the dizzy heights of supportive comments, it didn’t sit well with one Betoota Grove man who attended the first years of high school with the pair before winning a scholarship to a more cosmopolitan boarding school in Rockhampton.

Sam Cutler-Smith, son of a popular and successful local winemaker, spoke to The Advocate about seeing such local drama play out over the internet.

“It does make me a little bit homesick,” said Sam.

“But yeah. I know Taylor’s family grows a lot of dope for the bikies around here, so what she said about having Sharnee knocked off like it was nothing kind of creeped me out a bit – because I could see it happening one-hundred-percent,”

“Ah Betoota. I hope it never changes. It’ll always be home but Jesus fuck, I could never live there again.”

CSIRO To Fund Study Into Why Cats Do The Things They Do

TEXT:

It’s hardly news but Australia’s peak scientific body, the CSIRO, is launching a study into why cats do the things they do that make us sad.

Spurred on by a recent episode with his feline life companion, CSIRO researcher Gavin Pooley decided to get to the bottom of why his cat seems to do things solely out of spite.

“For the tenth time this year, I’ve trod in cat shit in the middle of the night when I’ve hopped up to take a piss,” he said.

“You’d think it comes with being a pet owner in an apartment, you know. But my cat, Gregory, like to shit in my ugg boots. I keep them near the bed in case I need to get up in the night and do things,”

“So for the tenth time this year, I’m smeared digested Whiskas up the inside of my ugg boot then awkwardly hobbled through the flat to the shitter with it plastered between my toes. So I thought, rather than punt Gregory off my 19th story balcony onto the bus interchange, I’d research why he does it.”

And so the study was born.

Early estimates suggest the total cost of the endeavour will be close to $900 and seven cats.

The Advocate reached out to the RSPCA regarding Mr Pooley’s casual threats of throwing his cat to its untimely death, but have yet to receive a reply.

However, one of our reporters who studied physics at high school calculated that a medium-sized cat falling at terminal velocity has the potential energy to either break the neck of a person it landed on or punch a hole in the roof of a passing bus.

Young Lawyer On The Cusp Of Burning Out Saved Yet Again By Motivational Poster

TEXT:

There was a point in time when Mark Donald cared about his clients.

That time was a long time ago.

As his caseload increases with each new day, he sees his youth dissolve into Friday and Saturday nights spent with either his friends from the office or old friends from high school.

Everyone seems to be doing something more interesting with their lives. One of his close friends recently climbed Mt Kilimanjaro. Another is training for next year’s Winter Olympics in South Korea.

Mark specialises in capital market law, something he even struggles to explain to people.

“Every day is the same, it’s just a computer and an hour for lunch,” he said.

“Yesterday over lunch, I sat by myself in the food court downstairs and stared off into the distance, zoning out and tried to remember a time when I was professionally happy. You know in high school, I wanted to be a teacher? But then I saw how all my teachers lived. The Japanese cars, they premade sandwiches from home for lunch. The corduroy pants,”

“So I became a lawyer so I could drive a fast car and eat sushi for lunch. Just before I spoke to you, I was looking at Canadian work visas. I could quit my job and smoke BC Bud in Whistler for a year, teaching kids to snowboard. Maybe that would cheer me up. I just need a change.”

However, just before he picked his computer monitor up and threw it across the room at a co-worker chewing on a banana with his mouth open, he looked up at the motivational poster on his cubical wall and took a deep breath.

Nestled between a photo of former Wallaby great Jason Little and a portrait of former Justice of the High Court of Australia, The Hon Michael Kirby AC CMG, is an image that continues to inspire Mark to keep going.

“If it wasn’t for the poster, I would’ve quit months ago,”

“Eat time the going gets tough, I just look up at Jason Little and think, ‘What would Jason do? Would he just lie down at let the All Blacks run over the top of him? No, he’d hold onto the ball and risk the penalty. Never give up,'”

“The other posters are less effective, but totally necessary.”

Wasted Local Man At Gig Tells Soundie To Turn The Bass Guitar Up

TEXT:

Despite there not being a bass guitar on stage, a local concert-goer took it upon himself last night to wander over to the sound technician to tell him to turn the bass up.

Trying desperately to catch the soundies eye during the third song, Hamish Madden told The Advocate that he couldn’t just stand there and let everyone suffer through another baseless track.

“I tried to mime the bass guitar, you know, strumming with two fingers and whatnot but he couldn’t see me,” said the 26-year-old software consultant.

“So I went over and told him to turn the bass up and the prick just smiled at me. Who does he think was on stage? The fucking White Stripes or something? Garage rock revival died with John Paul II. Music has bass now,”

“Anyway, that’s what I told him and lo and behold, we had bass. No worries, everyone. I’ll take care of it.”

However, the sound technician from last night’s Black Key’s tribute show in the Betoota Dolphins Leagues Club beer garden oddly answered our calls before noon.

Michael Stuckey, a local musician and freelance soundie, said he can’t even remember seeing or interacting with Madden but he was able to confirm that many punters give him their two cents about where the sound levels and mix should be.

“Yeah look,” he said.

“If I had a dollar for every pissed cunt who walks up to the decks and tells me to turn something up or down, I’d have enough to do my grocery shopping at David Jones,”

“You just smile, nod and hope they fuck off or give you a thumbs up after to turn a nob. But yeah, nah. Never really take their advice onboard.”

Local Dog Stops Thunderstorm With Bark

A popular Betoota Ponds golden retriever has reportedly stopped a local thunderstorm this afternoon by barking at it.

With each boom and crash of the passing tempest, Brett, the 11-year-old canine in question responded with an equally as loud bark.

A short time later, the clouds began to disperse over town and the surrounding area was spared the damaging winds of destructive flooding often associated with a good bush storm.

“Brett often barks at storms,” said his owner Gale Coleman.

“But this is the first time he’s been able to stop one in its tracks. I’ve seldom seen him keep it up for so long. Most of the time when the rain starts, he runs inside,”

“But this time, he was determined to stop the storm.”

Speaking candidly to The Advocate about his experience, Brett was humble in victory, choosing only to lick our reporter’s shoes before retiring to the backyard to eat his own faeces.

Watch Out Local Hiking Trails! Man’s New Patagonia T-Shirt Arrived In The Mail Today And He’s Not Afraid To Use It

Unable to go hiking until now, one local accountant almost completely devoid of a personality received his new Patagonia tee shirt today in the mail – which means he now has everything he needs to tackle the great outdoors.

“I don’t know which local trail I want to hike first!” gleamed Peter Hutchinson, 29.

Moments before, the aquaphobic Cancerian ripped apart the plastic packaging that enslaved his Patagonia tee shirt during it’s transit from the warehouse to his bespoke, artisan Betoota Grove apartment.

“Geanie! Get in here! My Patagonia tee shirt is here. Let’s go hiking this weekend! Oh my God! Finally get to use all my camping gear. Let’s do the Moonda Lake Backrun!”

“Are you hearing this, Geanie? We can finally go hiking and camping like we’d always dreamed!”

Geanie was hearing this, but she chose not to listen because like most people, Geanie hates camping.

Geanie Stephens hates camping so much, they threw out Peter’s old Patagonia shirt because she was sick and tired of spending every weekend out in the sticks.

“Look, I love Peter, I enjoy his company and everything but fuck me,” she said.

“Would it fucking kill you mate if we spent a weekend at home eating pizza, smoking weed and chonging each other’s brains out? Would it? I don’t think so,”

“But it looks like we’re going camping this weekend, despite me having plans. He’s such a Patacuck.”

Local Man’s Day Sufficiently Bad Enough To Warrant Purchase of Frozen Pizza, White Wine

TEXT:

Stephen Kovari has had an absolute cunt of a yesterday.

Speaking to The Advocate from his humble Betoota Ponds studio apartment, the 36-year-old salesperson said everything could go wrong did go wrong, before paraphrasing the rest of the song’s more offensive lyrics.

First, his boss called him into his office first thing.

“We all need to tighten our belts here,” said his boss.

“Losing those two big clients means we need to trim the fat. Stephen, I need you to prove your worth to the company. Why should we keep you on board?”

Kovari bumbled and stuttered his way through a vague response that his boss seemed unconvinced by.

That was enough to put the already mildly-hungover Gemini in a bad mood.

“Then Jennifer, who sits opposite me on the sales desk, took her fucking shoes off and stunk out our end of the room. I’d ask her to put them on but her skin’s about as thick as service station goona wrap,”

“It was serious ‘fuck’s sake’ scenario it was.”

Thinking things couldn’t get any worse, he just missed the D45 bus back to Betoota Ponds, with the driver shutting the doors right in his face.

Forced to wait another 45 minutes in the unseasonably cold weather for the next bus, his phone died a mere 7 minutes into the wait.

But finally, as the next bus arrived at 8 pm, was full of local teens who’d intimidated the driver to the point where they all freely enjoyed few bus ciggies and a cold beer.

“Those kids were rolling stubbies full of piss down the aisle, the savages,” said Stephen.

“I had my laptop bag at my feet and it got piss on it. I was about to snap but I thought it’d be a bad look if I beat a 16-year-old boy half to death, so I just sat there and did nothing like the devon log I am.”

As the sun set on a day his day from hell, Kovari walked into the local mixed business around the corner from his home, bought two Chicken Tandoori frozen pizzas and a $6 bottle of Stanthorpe riesling.

“I’ve earned this,” he said.

“Because tomorrow is basically going to be the same old shit.”

20-Year-Old Bloke Who All Of A Sudden Piled On Muscle Either Joining Bikies Or Police Force

TEXT:

A local 20-year-old bloke could be making a move on either side of the law at this rate, judging by how rigged he has gotten over the last year or so.

His recent purchases of heaps of cool news clothes and upgraded taste in dark spirits also leads one think that he has a pretty safe job lined up in the near future.

The local hard cunt looks to be making a career out of his well-known issues with authority, as his recent increase in both body mass and body art show that he’s been moving in a different crowd.

However, Betoota residents are today discussing what side of the law Codey is dabbling with.

“I reckon it’s the coppers for sure” says Shona Guerra, a local fabric store owner.

“His tatts don’t past his wrists and neck”

Beryl, the high school nurse seems to sink it’s probably the bikies.

“Shona, darling… You know what his old man was like. He’d be turning in his grave if he heard is son was wearing a badge”

“Plus I got to see how that kid behaved at school. There was no policeman in that boy”

It was then agreed that due to his current physical stature and track record as a school bully, Codey could actually be joining either.

“It’s hard to tell these things” says Shona.

“They are essentially the same make”

“Coal Is Actually Pretty Neat” Says Point Piper Man With Solar Panels And Hybrid Car

TEXT:

A popular Point Piper public servant has sighed repeatedly over his cappuccino this morning after realising that all the renewable and sustainable energy technology he invested in previously isn’t compatible with the future.

Malcolm Turnbull, the 29th and current Prime Minister of Australia, told neighbours that he plans to have the solar panels taken down off the roof and thrown in a skip, plus he’s thinking about driving his Toyota Prius down a local boat ramp and replacing it with a Toyota Landcruiser Sahara.

“I know I used to tell you all about how good solar power is and whatnot,” he told one neighbour.

“But I’ve come to the understanding that coal is actually quite a viable option. There is clean coal now. So clean, even developed nations such as Japan and Germany still burn coal. Japan invented Pokemon, which speaks volumes for their ingenuity and genius,”

“But yeah. Forget what I said about all that clean energy business. Heck, my Prius wouldn’t even pull the skin off a tomato soup. If it were a tractor, it wouldn’t even be able to pull a seven-tyne chisel plough through a nice soft patch of volcanic Mullaley dirt. Once again guys, I’m sorry.”

Speaking candidly to The Advocate about the shock move by the former Communications Minister to backflip on solar panel ownership, a fellow Point Piper resident was surprised Turnbull even had them installed in the first place.

Francis Greenhorne-Wilco, a semi-retired art dealer and Commodore of the Prince Edward Yacht Club, explained to our reporters that not many people on the Piper peninsula gave much thought to energy prices or bills as they’re typically redirected to their accountant’s office.

“I haven’t seen a power bill in over 30 years, not since I was living rough in Paddington,” said Francis.

“When we notice Malcolm putting those roof mirrors up on his home, we all wondered what on Earth he was doing! Then when we saw him cruising about in the vulgarly quiet hybrid car, we feared we’d lost him to politics forever,”

“Now those ghastly panels are coming down. I empathise for him, I really do. Having to deal with all those common people in Parliament. Oh well.”

Betoota Holiday Campsite Introduces New Gender-Neutral Bathrooms

TEXT:

Betoota’s iconic ‘Outdoor Recreational Holiday Park’ has today unveiled their daring new gender-neutral bathrooms, as board members of the 200-year-old tourism destination admit that “it’s time to acknowledge that we live in 2017”.

The new facilities are tipped to offer the exact same experience for men and women (and everything in between) without the pressures of archaic gender criteria.

“We just want people to be able lay cable without having to worry about being questioned over which gender they identify with” says campsite owner-operate and treasurer, Terry Mosely (72).

“We’ve provided a shovel and some loo paper – there’s 2100 acres to choose from. If you walk far enough into the bush no one is gonna know whether you are Arthur or Martha. And in my humble opinion, it’s none of their fucking business anyway”

Of course, the unanimous business decision has been shouted down by several religious organisations in the region, who feel that their town’s  children are at risk of becoming as confused as the local priests are about sexuality.

“It’s PC gone mad” said local No Voter, Berrick Cornardi

“What’s next, men wearing pink shirts at the pub?”

However, Mr Mosely says the idea first came to the campsite after an outdoor screening of the 1994 Australian comedy-drama The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.

“That movie was a hoot, and it reminded us that sometimes blokes who like dressing as girls, or girls who used to be blokes, enjoy visiting the Outback”

“We just wanted to make sure we had the right facilities in place when a bus full of glamorous drag queens pull into town for the night”

“Hugo Weaving should have won an Oscar for that film. The ABBA soundtrack was phenomenal”

Pete Evans’ Cookbooks Placed In Fiction Section At QBD Bookstores

TEXT:

Regional Queensland’s premier bookshop has today drawn a line in the sand between dietary self-help and potentially dangerous cult-like trends.

QBD, the only in-store book retailer in the greater Betoota region, has said that they will not be ‘drinking the Kool-aid’ of Celebrity Chef Pete Evans, also known as ‘Paleo Pete’ – who has in the past suggested that children should not be eating fibre and that three-meals-per-day is a dangerous concept for humankind.

Betoota QBD manager, Barb (59) says she’ll happily sell Paleo Pete’s books to anyone stupid enough to jump on the bandwagon, but she couldn’t possibly bring herself to put it in any section other than ‘fiction’.

“My niece is a paleo. She seems to like it”

“But this man is spouting something far more dangerous than that”

“I mean stone the crows, does he really reckon we should stop feeding infants breastmilk”

This not the first time Evans has been under fire for playing God, with his controversial baby paleo cookbook, Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way for new mums, babies & toddlers, having to be released over iTunes because publisher would touch it.

A DIY baby formula made from blended livers, bone broth and oils caused dietitians the most concern.

“In my view, there’s a very real possibility that a baby may die if this book goes ahead,” president of the Public Health Association of Australia, Professor Heather Yeatman.

Just last year he came under fire for his new ‘asbestos broth’ recipe for infants.

“There has been no actual research into whether or not Asbestos broth might harm the human body. Let alone a babies body,” said evans.

“We live in a society that tells us our infants are supposed to depend on milk that comes out of their mothers teat. What are we dealing with here? Babies or cows?”

Aside from the hysterical sales surrounding diet books and modern fantasy, Barb says that the fastest selling book of 2017 is definitely this very newspaper’s new almanac, Betoota’s Australia (available here, via QBD online).

“Oh it’s just a great insight into Australia for the sheltered young kids in towns like this”

“I bought six for my nephews before they took off to try their luck playing footy in the QCup. I think it’s very important that they known what a Greens voter looks like before they say something offensive about land-clearing in the city”

Study Confirms Office Fridge Can Go Suck A Chode

TEXT:

Employees at Betoota Eastside Reality have mixed feelings in response to the conclusion of a three-year study that has today confirmed, the office fridge can go suck a chode.

“No surprises here,” says junior agent Carla Tuckey.

“I hate that fridge and I agree; it can go suck a chode.”

Urban Dictionary defines ‘chode’ as a penis wider than it is long – and according to HR manager Ron Davies (40), performing fellatio on said chode would be a fitting punishment for the office fridge’s incompetence.

“I’ve got to keep my Mothers in my draw because they get nicked otherwise. I gotta drink them room temperature like a moron!”

While conclusive in the sense of determining the treatment the office fridge deserves, the study has drawn controversy for not aptly citing the single source of fridge’s misgivings, something the members of the office have numerous theories about.

“No one ever throws anything away,” states agent Sally Templeman.

“There’s practically a shelf dedicated containers full of mould and cartons of off milk.”

According to finance assistant Dale Hughes, nothing could be further from the truth.

“Is she joking? People chuck out stuff all the time! Someone threw away my half a Pad Thai from last week and I was going to eat that!”

“It’s always filthy,” says regional manager Ian Watts.

“There’s like a black puddle on the bottom shelf. I have to have all my lunches at the club because of it.”

“I don’t know why they’re complaining,” says receptionist Karen Nichols.

“They never have to clean it, I’m always the bloody one who cleans it!”

While the employees of Eastside Reality may not agree on the specific reason the office fridge continues to fail them, they are able to take solace in their unity for agreeing, it can go suck a chode.

Reformed Child Psychopath Somehow Turned Out OK After Drowning 47 People

TEXT:

Katie Frost has bared the burden of her past for what seems like an age.

While on the surface, she seems calm and collected. Almost normal in her own way.

A known quiet achiever, popular among her peers. The now 23-year-old was the Head Girl of her exclusive East Betoota private school.

But what lies beneath is much, much less mundane.

“As a 10-year-old, I drowned multiple people in a pool and laughed about it,” she said.

“The final count was 47. I just couldn’t help myself. Every day after school, I’d come home and torture these people. Starve them. Deprive them of sleep and other basic human rights,”

“It was a rough couple of years but I got through it. I haven’t killed anyone since and I never will.”

Initially, her boyfriend Dylan Carmichael lost a lot of sleep after he learned of her past.

Each night, he tossed and turned in bed. Kung-Fu fighting his bedsheets with stress and worry after learning the quiet, confident young woman he’d grown to love is actually a prolific serial killer.

It wasn’t until he reapproached the conversation with Katie that he was finally able to put his mind at ease.

“It turns out she [Katie] was talking about The Sims, that fucking computer game,” said Dylan.

“Fuck me, for a moment there I thought she was talking about actual people. I thought the ‘Sims’ she was referring to where like a family or something! [laughs] But yeah, feeling much better right now,”

“Oi yeah, but at the same time, nah. It’s a still a bit weird? Don’t you think? She’s a strange fish, she is. But I love her.”

“Argh! Is It Friday, Yet?” Asks Boring Coworker Who’s Gonna Work On Saturday Anyway

TEXT:

A French Quarter office person has asked a fellow office person if it’s Friday yet, to which the response was an uneasy smile and a cough-laugh.

Local boutique and bespoke accountant, Lachlan Dowling, asked one of his coworkers this morning if it was Friday – when he clearly knew it was only Thursday.

On the receiving end of the 29-year-old’s attempt at humour was Amy Conch, who told The Advocate that it’s people like Lachlan who make her day just that little bit longer.

“I mean, what do I say to that?” she asked.

“Do I just laugh and say, ‘No, Lachlan, it’s only Thursday silly!’ or something like that? I don’t know. It’d probably be better if he just ignored my entire existence, to be honest with you,”

“He’s gonna work through the weekend anyway. What’s the point of him saying that?”

“The only tangible interaction I have with Lachlan is asking him to select a level for me when we ride the lift together coincidently twice a year.”

However, Dowling spoke freely to The Advocate about his feelings toward it not being Friday and offered some explanation for his behaviour.

Baring his soul to our reporters, the friendly Virgo said that he only tries to bring ‘positive vibes’ into the office to boost morale.

“Everyone always wishes it was a Friday,” he said.

“Because that means the next day is Saturday, where if you are one of the many who listened in school, you don’t have to go to work! Nobody actually enjoys working!”

“So that’s why I made a joke with Amy about it being Friday when it wasn’t Friday! She’s so funny!”

New Study Launched Into Why Local Buses Magically Appear The Moment Someone Lights A Cigarette

Morris Lupus ran for the 9:01 am L45 to Betoota Green Junction this morning, something he feels well above but his current financial situation says otherwise.

As quick and hard as the 48-year-old ran, he missed it.

Sighing to himself, it didn’t take long for him to take a perch outside Mrs Cartwright’s Cake Shop on Willis Avenue and light up a smoke.

Slowly catching his breath between puffs, the local consultant surgeon at Royal Betoota Base Hospital thought he’d enjoy a short little break waiting for the next L45 to turn up.

“I thought I had at least 15 minutes,” said Lupus.

“But as soon as I lit up a smick [sic], another bus turned up. I basically got two draws before I had to throw it in the gutter. Every fucking time, mate,”

“They should launch a study into why this keeps happening. It always happens without a doubt. Murphey’s Law.”

And launch a study they have.

Australia’s peak scientific body, United Diamantina Breweries [UDB], has launched a study into why not only local Betoota Buslines but the whole town’s metro public transport system.

Dennis Collie, from UDB spoke to The Advocate a short time ago about what the study hopes to achieve and why they’ve taken it upon themselves to do it.

“Since the legislation changed last year to allow open containers [of alcohol] on the Betoota Buslines and Betoota CityTrain Metro services, we’ve been campaigning heavily to legalise smoking again on local public services,” said Collie.

“That’s to save the inconvenience of having to effectively waste a cigarette each time a bus arrives ahead of schedule,”

“But we’re launching this study into exactly why public transport always shows up moments after you light a cigarette because it always happens and it causes a lot of distress to our customers and the wider Diamantina community.”

The study’s findings are due to be published by the end of the year.

Local Mother Still Reeling From News Her Son’s New Girlfriend Is A ‘Penciller’

TEXT:

A prominent Betoota Grove mother of four was forced to have an after-dinner lie down against her will tonight after she learned her youngest son’s new girlfriend holds her cutlery like she holds a pencil.

Wanda Pieterson-Werbles, of Hyacinth Drive, told her husband she was feeling faint at approximately 7 pm this evening, moments after the family dinner had concluded.

Joey Peterson-Werbles, 19, felt it appropriate to introduce the family his partner-of-a-month, Bacardi Opal, deciding to bring her along for tonight’s two-course dinner of Pizza Shapes with cheddar and smoked oysters and a Chicken Tonight creation.

However, the wheels began to fall off as soon as they sat down for an early meal at 6 pm.

“She turned her nose up at the smoked oysters, that should’ve been the first red flag,” said Wanda as she lay on the couch with a heavily wooded Chardonnay clutched in her hands.

“People like us, I mean, Betoota Grove people, all enjoy smoked oysters and Shapes. The cheddar was even name-brand, that politically incorrect one, too.”

“Then when I served the main and she picked up her eating utensils, I could feel my whole left side begin to tingle. Bacardi is a penciller – and my son kept that from me this whole time. He should be coaching her to eat like a lady, not like some drive-thru McDonald’s Hot Cake eating moll… Heavens above!”

Quick to defend both his mother and his new flame, Joey said that he noticed not just his mother but his whole family recoil in disgust at the sight of Bacardi holding her cutlery.

The confident Pisces told The Advocate that it’s ‘this type of shit’ as to why he chose to move out at such a young age.

“My parents ask me why I slum it down in the French Quarter, with all the junkies and artists, when I could be living up on the hill at home,” said Joey.

Bacardi rolls an unfiltered cigarette to the side, letting out an earth-shattering cough as she does it.

“It’s because they care about shit like how people hold their cutlery and they judge people on it. It’s so fucking stupid, it’s 2017. Mum’ll get over it. I reckon Dad couldn’t give two fucks,”

“Bacs and I are taking it steady, see where it goes. Pencil or no pencil. Forever and ever.”

“I forgot the bloke’s name as soon as I sat down in that meeting,” said Marcel.

Local Tattoo Parlour Investigated For Not Having Links To Bikie Gangs

TEXT:

A late model Toyota Prius parked outside a popular local tattoo parlour has sparked a police investigation into the business as it faces allegations that it has no apparent links to a criminal bikie organisation.

SkinCity666, in Bougainville, the town’s light industrial heartland, was raided early this morning by tactical police from the West Betoota command after a tip-off from the public.

Inside the venue, no evidence of drugs, weapons and other criminal activity was discovered.

“It’s disturbing to know that an operation such as this was operating in our desert community, around young families,” said Detective Chief Inspector Morris Ponyman.

“There’s a responsibility for tattoo parlours such as SkinCity666 to establish and maintain a healthy relationship with one of the many local bikie gangs in the area and the owners of this particular parlour have let the community down on that,”

“The case is now with the Department of Public Prosecutions and they’ll lay charges as they deem fit, thank you.”

It wasn’t until local police received a warrant to surveil SkinCity that they came to discover that there was no criminal element to the business.

Shockingly, the aforementioned Toyota Prius was registered to a local small business owner, who was visiting SkinCity to have a tattoo done to celebrate the life of his’s 16-year-old Pekingese bitch that passed away earlier in the year.

“We saw the man leave with a dog tattoo on his calf, his first and only visible tattoo, and we were just sick to our stomachs. One junior detective vomited. That’s when we knew we had to act. We had to stop the madness.”

Why Do Only Upper-Middle-Class-Family-With-Labradors Celebrate Halloween?

TEXT:

The Diamantina Shire has launched an investigation into why only predominantly-upper-middle-class-families-with-labrador-retrievers celebrate the traditional American holiday of Halloween, when other members of the wider Betoota community choose to not observe it.

Come the 31st of October, the white-four-barb fences of Betoota Heights and Remienko Grove are lined with cobwebs, ghouls and other assorted decorations that pay homage to the spooky, scary theme of the night.

However, in the predominantly working-class areas of town like as out on the Airport Road in East Betoota and Bacchus Ponds, there is next to no ‘trick or treating’ to be seen, let alone reported to council.

“We think it’s because the folk from the higher-socio-economic areas of town are pressured by their kids into celebrating the holiday,” said Councillor Helen Caldwell, representing Bacchus Ponds.

“There’s also a substantially lower crime rate, meaning sending your child out unchaperoned of an evening time is easier. You’re not about to have a flathead screwdriver thrust into your torso over an iPhone 4 like you would in my ward,”

“Anyway, that’s my two cents. Disposable parental income and safety.”

The Advocate reached out to various families in Remienko Grove and Betoota Heights via a local Thermomix Facebook group and received a number of responses.

One prominent respondent, a local GP’s domestic partner, said that she enjoys bringing joy into the lives of her children – which is why they celebrate whatever Halloween celebrates.

Speaking on behalf of her children, Poncho and Daphne, Clem Cartwright told The Advocate that her kids and their friends ‘just love’ going trick or treating and taking part in the joy and fun that comes from being born into the class they were.

“I love hearing their sweet little voices so full of happiness and fun,” she said.

“The same type of joy I feel coming home from a long lunch with the girls, washing a Xanax down with a glass of my husband’s scotch then letting myself pass out in the garden like a common tramp,”

“It’s just so much fun, Halloween with the candy and everything.”

Ms Cartwright then logged off.

The investigation is ongoing.

Local Insecure Friend Waits Patiently To One Up The Story You Just Told

Regaling his close friends, at their request, for the fourth time this year about an ‘epic’ boat cruise he went one time in Greece, Glenn Gleitzman was just putting the icing on his popular yarn when another friend quickly took the opportunity to jump in.

Maybe one day when the music stops when we all get married and have kids and I’m the only bloke left without a chair, I’ll realise this. Maybe.”

Echoing his insecurities was Glenn himself, who spoke candidly to The Advocate about why he and his close friends put up with Murray when all he seems to do is one-up your best yarns.

While he tried his best to articulate exactly why they haven’t abandoned the old group chat Murray’s in with them for a new one, rather than just booting him out, Gleitzman said the answer is simple.

“Murray is a strange fish,” confirmed Glenn.

“He’s full of good stories and tales of how all these make-believe people shower him with constant praise. Whatever, the guy’s harmless I don’t really care if he likes telling wonky yarns, power to him,”

“But I don’t know where he gets his gears from. My oh my, does Murray source some quality gear. I can’t work out where he gets it, but he’s always on and he’s never let us down. He’s by far the most popular person in the group. Easily.”

Studio Executives Gather To Decide Which Classic Movie They’ll Remake Next

TEXT:

Move over original thought, there’s a new, real moneymaker in town.

A number of leading local executives from a prominent South Betoota film studio have gathered today to decide which classic Australian film they’re going to remake next.

The head-honchos from United Diamantina Projects have put together a presentation, showcasing a lexicon of timeless movies, that they plan on showing investors – who will ultimately have the final say in what classic movie gets remade.

“We’re going to try to push them towards remaking Shine‘ and we’ll also angle towards casting Lincoln Lewis in the lead role of David Helfgott,” said one executive.

“If everything goes to plan, it’ll be the feel-good blockbuster of next summer. Failing that, we might just remake Muriel’s Wedding, which would be pretty cheap. Give some Neighbours and Home and Away their big feature break,”

“But personally, I’d like to remake Crocodile Dundee and make it more current, have a real hot go and getting back into the US market again. Like in the good old days. Cast someone like Hugo Weaving or a lesser Hemsworth as Mick. It would be great. No more knives, just sawn off 410s like in Chopper.”

The discussion carried on well into the afternoon, with little to no progress being made at the time of publication.

Local Unlucky Man Develops Common Cold During Common Heat Wave

TEXT:

Despite taking every precaution, one North Betootanese accountant was forced to take a precious sick day today after coming down with the common cold after a weekend spent doing everything to his body to run it down.

The greater Diamantina Shire is currently experiencing a common heatwave, which makes Connor Townsend’s diagnosis unusual.

“I can’t believe I’ve got a cold, at this time of year,” said the bemused 24-year-old number cruncher.

“This weekend was pretty tame compared to the last few, I didn’t even get that pissed. But yeah, it’s a full-on cold. Headache, sore joints and a runny nose. Mate, I’m at death’s door,”

“And it’s so fucking hot outside, I don’t get it. How can you get a cold when it’s 37 outside? There’s like 3% humidity in the air, it actually hurts to be out in the sun – and here I am sitting under an air conditioner with a cold. Ridiculous.”

Connor’s family GP confirmed the bad news to both The Advocate and Mr Townsend’s employer, KPMG Betoota, who said that while it is rare to get a cold during a spell of warm weather, it’s not unheard of.

Local GP Dr Sally Washbrook said that a number of lifestyle factors have contributed to her patient’s rapid descent into illness.

“He told me what he did on the weekend and now it doesn’t surprise me that he’s feeling sick,” she said.

“While I’ll spare you the details, I don’t need to spell it out to you what he’s gotten up to. But it involves binging drinking, drug taking and other risky behaviours. Basically, he’s played with fire and this time he’d burnt his little paw,”

“He’ll be fine in a few day. I told him to take Panadol and sleep. Eat nice things. He’ll be back in a few days. I hope, there’s been a lot of press recently about people dying from colds.”

Local Sunday-Sessioner Under Impression He Got Away With It

TEXT:

Atoning for Friday on Saturday is nothing compared to paying the price for Saturday on Sunday.

That’s according to one local graphic designer, who threw caution to the wind over the weekend and drank Friday through Sunday night.

“I feel fine,” said Gregor Redpath, a recent graduate of Collins Street Polytechnic in the Old City District.

“Which is weird because I felt like I was going to die on Sunday morning but I just got back on it with the boys after lunch,”

“We finished pretty early, wrapped things around midnight last night. Got up this morning and I feel pretty fresh. Might’ve got away with this one! [ laughs] hopefully, anyway.”

Overhearing the 23-year-old draftsman’s comments was his manager, who’s got a few more years of life under his belt.

Fast approaching 40, Gregor’s boss, Martin Waterford, told The Advocate that ‘life’ will catch up with his junior colleague.

“I’ll bet you $10 right now that tomorrow young Gregor will be having a Pad Thai and a can of Coke for lunch, [laughs]”

“He’ll question whether he even likes being a graphic designer. He’ll wonder if he should just pull the eject lever and move to London. That’s what drugs and alcohol do to young people, I used to be a young person, you know?”

“Tomorrow I don’t expect big things from him. If he turns up, I’ll be happy enough. Gregor is about to learn for the fiftieth time in his short life what terrible Tuesdays are.”

Office Tight-Arse Furious He Forgot To Sign Card For Present He Actually Put In For

TEXT:

Michael Kelsen, 27, has been left kicking himself after forgetting to sign the card for a co-worker’s birthday gift which he contributed to.

An email was sent around Kelsen’s North Betoota property management office about the birthday gift being organised for one of his more senior co-worker’s 40th birthday. 

After he read that it was a voluntary contribution, Kelsen thought long and hard about whether or not he could get away with not putting any money in. He soon came to the realisation that there would be a card full of names of the people who paid, so he decided it was in his best interest to donate.

“I put in $15 to be safe. It’s the most I’ve ever put in for a gift but the blokes one of the top dogs around here. I thought if I wanted a pay rise anytime soon, it’d be worth being out of pocket for.” 

It wasn’t until the following Friday evening, when speeches were given and the gift was presented, that Kelsen realised he didn’t sign the card.

“It was sitting on my desk for a while but I was caught up finishing a proposal. Someone must’ve come and nicked it off my desk. I just forgot about it after that.”

“Now no one will even know I put in. What a fucking waste.”

Modern-Day Man From Snowy River Recklessly Rides His Steel Brumby Down Kosciuszko Side

A modern-day Australian bushranger has peeled off from his pack of fellow reprobates to focus on his own interests, as the evening ends up at a 24-hour licenses hotel.

While keeping his gang in sight, local man Antonio James (28) has ridden his steel horse deep into the night, while in the comfort of an air-conditioned smoking room at the degenerate after-hours oasis, The Lord Kidman Hotel in Betoota.

“We’d love to join him but they don’t let you go in that room unless you are all individually playing a machine. They don’t let you stand around just one” says Brad, who’s trying his very hardest not to join Antonio on the road as an outlaw.

“He robs those things blind. At least, thats what he tells us”

“He is the modern day Ned Kelly. He’s just takes from the rich [gaming industry] – but he’s just such a gentlemen while he does it”

Antonio and his noble steed have held the same cracking pace for several hours now, well after the lock-out laws.

“Come on you bastard” he whispers.

“It’s just me boy. It’s just me.

Unfortunately, another feature flies by without any luck. Antonio isn’t playing Mr Nice guy anymore.

Man In New City Forced To Start Playing A Contact Sport Again To Make Friends

TEXT:

Moving to a new city can be daunting, especially if it’s work-related and to a place where you know nobody at all.

That’s what happened to South Betoota-native, Morris Chambers, who was relocated by Santos late last month from his quite Californian Bungalow on the City’s limits, to London.

Though he told The Advocate he was quite nervous about making the move, the 29-year-old engineer said he’s settling in ‘really well’ after making new friends at his new local rugby club.

However, the outgoing Taurus thought he played his last game of rugby in his third-year of university – telling himself he was done with feeling battered and bruised each Sunday morning.

“Boy, was I wrong,” said Chambers, as he lit his fourth Gitanes of the Skype interview.

“Until I moved over here to London, I never would’ve even considered pulling the boots on again. Let alone my cricket spikes. But, you know, how else to men in their late 20s make new friends?”

“At work? Give me a fucking break, I’m an engineer. My workmates are about as interesting as free-to-air television after midnight. Rugby was the only way I was going to meet normal people. People like me.”

Initially, he regretted the decision.

The explosive return to cardio made him feel like death was just around the corner. His lungs burned and his legs ached after each training session.

But those horrible feelings drifted away each time he went to the pub for tea with his teammates.

Slowly but surely, as his fitness improved, the flanker began to enjoy the game like he used to a schoolboy.

“I thought, by Joh, I’m actually having fun,” he said.

“I’m having fun despite getting hit late all the time and lifted above the horizontal. I’ve been punched and punched people back. It’s hilarious,”

“I feel alive.”

Hungover Teacher Decides Today Is Movie Day

Two-for-one proseccos at the Dolphins Leagues Club last night got the better of a local Year 2 teacher, who decided today that her class was going to watch a movie – followed by some DEAR time.

Emma Roper, a popular primary teacher at South Betoota Public School, told The Advocate that she feels like ants are crawling over her brain now and she’s having trouble keeping on task.

However, the 28-year-old is keeping it together.

“Today is movie day for Year 2,” she said.

“I’ve had two Panadols, two Beroccas and a litre of water. Cold pizza for breakfast. I’m starting to come back online but today is going to be an educational write-off,”

“That brain varnish prosecco will get you. $3 a glass and you get one for free. They’re basically throwing any responsible service out the window.”

But this isn’t the last Ms Roper will hear of this, as instead of putting on Shaun The Sheep for her class, she accidentally put on the classic thriller, Silence of the Lambs.

A number of parents have already expressed their feelings regarding the mixup, though most of them agree it’s nothing compared to what their kids are exposed to on the internet.

Local Father Beginning To Realise The Bachelorette Is Indeed A Rich Tapestry Of Human Emotion

TEXT:

Local father of four, Michael Collander, took time out of his busy Thursday morning to speak to The Advocate via telephone regarding The Bachelorette, which he’s often forced to watch of an evening time.

While he describes himself as not being a fan of reality television or television in general, the 43-year-old told our reporters that he’s shocked at himself for getting into the popular show.

“The girls have it on most nights, they sometimes even watch the repeats,” he said.

“I usually just sit out on the verandah on a warm night and have a cup of tea, maybe a Peter Stuyvesant or four. Maybe make a telephone call to the old man or my brother, you know. Maybe put the History Channel on when the girls go to bed,”

“Never thought I’d be chomping at the bit for the next episode of The Bachelorette. Very odd behaviour for this pleasant Diamantina gent such as I. The Bachelorette is indeed a rich tapestry – a tapestry of human emotion. A snapshot of the human condition.”

Equally as shocked was Michael’s eldest daughter, Amy, who told The Advocate that the ride to school this morning was quite interesting.

The Year 10 student at the exclusive North Betoota sports high school, St Glenn McGrath’s Grammar, told our reporters that her father was expressing his displeasure at seeing Pete, Eden and Jefferson get sent home.

“It’s fucking bullshit, those guys had a lot more to offer Sophie [Monk] and she basically just threw their love in the bin,” said Michael.

“Hopefully they all go onto long and illustrious careers in commercial radio like every other long-haired yahoo from this show does.”

Report: Nobody Cares What’s In McNuggets, They Taste Like Heroin

TEXT:

As urban legends continue to swirl regarding the ingredients in McDonald’s popular McNuggets, a recent study conducted by the CSIRO has declared that nobody really cares what’s in them as they taste like the popular and addictive narcotic drug, heroin.

While the multinational purveyor of fine foods remains tight-lipped as to what’s really in the freeze-fried delights, McDonald’s has assured The Advocate that there’s no heroin or any other drugs in them.

“There’s nothing sinister or illegal in McNuggets, that’s one thing we can confirm,” said McDonald’s Australia executive vice president Alisha Pie.

“But we do maintain a protection over the ingredients as it’s the secret to their success,”

“However, we are aware of the rumours that exist regarding how they made and what’s in them. We make our nuggets in Australia from natural ingredients, or at least I think we do. Some might’ve been dropped on the floor, I can’t say for sure. But yeah, they won’t kill you or get you stoned.”

Hitting back at the comments made by McDonald’s is one local McNuggets consumer, who said she can’t go longer than a day or two without the chicken without suffering withdrawal symptoms.

Tina Jenkins, a marginally employed textile specialist at Spotlight, told our reporters that if she doesn’t get her nuggets, she goes ‘mad.’

“No nuggets equals me waiting outside the North Betoota McDonald’s with a rock, telling people I’ll throw it at their car if they don’t buy me a ten-pack,” said Jenkins.

“They must have something in them, I can’t fucking function without them,”

“They’re like heroin to me.”

18-Year-Old Buying A Bottle Of OP Rum Thinks His New Years Is Going To End Well

TEXT:

Celebrations are heating up South Betoota and one local engineering student is getting ready to drink himself into a pair of handcuffs.

Walking past the bargain bin wines and other assorted brain varnishes down at the Cobb & Co Cellars on George Street, Elliot Stapleton explained to our reporters that he felt like treating himself tonight as he just received his first scholarship payment from the Regent Street Polytechnic College.

“I know it’s supposed to go towards paying down my HECS but yeah, I’ll deal with that later because it’s fucking New Year’s Eve, baby! Let’s get fucked up!” he said.

“Now, on to more important things. What should I get for myself? A bottle of scotch?”

“No, that’s what I need. 57% alcohol. That’ll do me. I’ll only drink half as much because it’s twice as strong. So, I can save it for kickons after the cricket gets turned off at the pub next week. Fuck, tonight is going to be so lit.”

However, that’s where Cobb & Co cashier Gavin Cashew starts to disagree with the promising student.

Time and time again, Gavin has seen a spritely first-year come into his drive-through liquor outlet and immediately get ahead of themselves.

“A good entry-level drink for someone like Elliot would be a six pack of New or something to that description, you know? A heavy beer but not a whole box,” he said.

“It’s in my professional opinion that giving a bottle of OP rum to an 18-year-old is quite irresponsible, not illegal. Provided he doesn’t get alcohol poisoning and perish in the heat, tonight should be a steep learning curve for the young man,”

“A night out never ends well if you start on OP rum. Before you know it, you’ll be on the bottom of a ‘stacks on’ but instead of your mates doing it, it’ll be those scary cops in the jumpsuits on top of you.”

“Anyway, Happy New Years everybody!”

Local Employed Man Jealous Of Jobless Hippies Slacklining In The Park

TEXT:

Thinking he had it made because he walks to work each day through a nice park, Miles Frucor knows deep down that things could be better.

More often than not, the 28-year-old corporate lawyer sees a troupe of gipsies in the park slacklining of a morning time – and he can’t help but feel jealous of their lifestyle.

“I mean, just look at these fucking bongheads,” he said.

“Not a care in the world. All they do it smoke dope and walk on that bloody jockey strap thing. What a life, hey? People like us are just making other people rich,”

“But still, I like owning a BMW and living in a nice place with cool shit on the walls. But yeah, nah. Sometimes, I feel like throwing my Clarkes in the creek and joining them. Not every day, but when I’ve had a cunt of a day or something.”

Mr Frucor’s sentiments regarding the park gipsies were echoed by the gipsies themselves, who say that their lifestyle is indeed enviable.

Speaking candidly to The Advocate, the head gypsy spoke of how he and his friends spend their time doing what they want, instead of what capitalism wants them to.

But he stopped short of saying that Miles would be better off with his Clarkes in the creek and his feet on the strap.

“Some people are supposed to be cogs in the machine, others are not,” said the sarong-wearing man.

“Miles is a cog,”

“He’s the kind of person who we ask for showers and cigarettes from. I’d trade like 20 hours of massage for an iPhone, though. So keep that in mind, I’ve got great hands.”

In that exclusive group was Willis Elrond Hazzard, a spritely young man that was lucky enough to turn 18 a few weeks earlier.

With him, he brought his Godfather’s present.

“My full name is engraved in it,” said Willis, as he unholstered the flask from the front pocket of his Rivers jeans.

“My middle name is Elrond, after Hugo Weaving in Lord of the Rings. Anyway, you want some of this? It’s good shit,”

Hazzard then went on to explain to our reporters that the ‘good shit’ he was talking about was Cointreau, which he pinched from his parent’s liquor cabinet shortly before leaving home.

Despite insisting numerous times, Willis was unable to get any of our reporters to enjoy a swig from his hip flask.

“More for me then, I guess,” he laughed.

“Oi but this is a great party, aye? Debbie’s a solid chick; so much fun, hey?”

“Do you reckon I’m on or nah?”

Shortly before our reporters left the party a few hours later, Hazzard was seen writhing around in the front garden dry heaving.

Man With Too Much Time On His Hands Decides To Make His Own Pasta

TEXT:

Peter Gormond is a man who thought he had everything – until he got a pasta maker.

Since that day last autumn, the 28-year-old panel beater turned his back on the traditional, dry pasta that the working class enjoys.

He’s a fresh pasta boy now.

Somehow, Peter finds time to make pasta each time he eats it. Sometimes two or three times a week.

The directionless real estate agent spoke to The Advocate a short time ago about why he makes his own pasta.

“I don’t really have a job at the moment that takes up all my time, so I’ve got lots of it left over at the end of the day,” he said.

“So yeah, I started making my own pasta because it keeps me doing something. Takes my mind off how unrewarding my life is,”

“But the pasta is only one part of a pasta dish. Despite taking the time to make my own fucking fettuccine, I just dump a jar of bargain bin Dolmio sauce over it. Pretty good metaphor for my life right now. Ying and yang type shit, man.”

In addition to making his own pastas, Peter also revealed he’s been light-heartedly browsing the internet for a cheap breadmaker.

However, he’s on the fence for the time being.

“I don’t know about making my own bread,” he said.

“It looks quite hard and easy to fuck up. Just like life.”

Chicken Surprisingly Outperforms Beef At Local Charity Event

TEXT:

In an unprecedented twist to the evening, the chicken dish has actually received rave reviews.

At a local fundraiser for the Betoota Small Business Network’s non-perishables for Africa drive, guests approached the set menu with justified sceptisism.

As the vegetarian meals made their way to the diet-requirement guests, a large majority of the 200-people plus patronage begin to barter.

“If I end up with the chicken, do you wanna swap?” one moron asks his girlfriend.

“I’m feeling like the beef”

As the meals come out one by one it becomes quickly clear that the chicken has a pretty good sauce or something on it, and some relatively bigger vegies, whereas the beef actually looks like it might have been a pre-prepared stew.

“I saw that chicken land in front of me and my heart stopped” said one guest, Nick.

“I saw it coming minutes before hand when the guy directly in front of me got beef, so I did the math and realised I was going to get chicken. Every odd number gets chicken”

Lucky for Nick, however, the chicken was by far the best option out of the two, not that there were any options.

“No one wanted to swap, but I kind of shut up when I saw the size. It had a couple inches on the beef in circumference – and it smelt delicious”

“The beef option looked like an RSL wet lunch”

With the jugs of beer flowing to tables, it’s only a matter of time until the bloated guests discover they have been drinking midstrength beer all night.

Sione is currently a rugby boy rolling through town with a skinful of piss and a bunch of obnoxious mates from the suburbs, while Willie is wearing a security ID and earning a wage moderating the behaviour of drunk morons like the one Sione just arrived with.

“Whatsup bro” asks Willie, throwing in the subtle Kiwi lingo to confirm their bond while taking a look at the ID that Sione already had ready for him”

“Whats going on tonight?”

Sione responds in a humble tone, while also utilising this unique connection as an opportunity to get his drunk team mates inside the venue.

“Not much, uce. Just out for a few. These boys are alright”

Willie smiles with a ‘shot bro’ look on his face.

“Make sure you keep an eye on them, aye” he says, while unhooking the nightclub rope

“For sure bro” says Sione.

“You Saa?” Sione asks, in an extra effort to chum up by asking Willie’s exact family background.

“Yeah uce. South Auckland”

REPORT: Partygoer ‘drinking whiskey out tha [sic] bottle’ definitely not think about tomorrow

TEXT:

A report commissioned by Australia’s peak scientific body has concluded that people who drink hard liquor straight from the bottle are ‘definitely’ not thinking about tomorrow.

Glenn Davidson, from the CSIRO, told our reporters that a number of problem binge drinkers were surveyed for the study and nearly all respondents replied that their mind was elsewhere when drinking.

“It’s a common misconception that partygoers that sip whiskey or another brown spirit are having a good time, that they’re living in the moment,” he said.

“We found that the opposite is often the case,”

“You cannot consciously enjoy 33 standard drinks in under an hour and still be thinking about tomorrow. If you’re thinking about tomorrow, you have two beers and drive home. People who do that type of reckless drinking are doing it for a whole other reason.”

Just what those reasons are have become a matter of speculation for the CSIRO, who admitted that problem drinkers abuse alcohol for a myriad of reasons.

One being low-self-esteem and a complete, detailed feeling of self-loathing.

That’s according to one local graphic designer, who spoke to The Advocate briefly about his drinking habits at parties.

“Yes, I drink whiskey out tha [sic] bottle whenever I attend parties,” he said.

“Even dinner parties. My friends all bring nice bottles of wine and whatnot. I turn up with a bottle of Fireball and inhaled it in 20 minutes. Don’t ask me why I do it, it just makes me feel good,”

“It is what it is. Res ipsa loquitur. Let the good times roll.”

With the taller passengers now cramping their necks as they remain jammed underneath the baggage compartments, just about every soul aboard the plane is having their personal space violated in one way or another.

“Would they hurry up?” she hisses.

“What is taking so long? I can never understand it”

The tense atmosphere is also not being complimented by the fact that no one wants to look at each other in the face.

With desperate passengers now attempting to unload their bags from underneath the compartment without nearly enough space to safely bring them to the aisle floor, it seems only about three or four people on this entire plane are sitting down.

Perennially-Late Local Lebanese Bloke Appropriately Nicknamed ‘Yalla’

If you want Sam Mousawi to be somewhere on time, tell him to be there an hour before you will.

The 27-year-old South Betoota resident has a reputation for being late.

So much so that his friends often joke that his nickname should actually be ‘Yalla’ – an Arabic term used to hurry people up.

Recently, it seems that joke has become a reality.

The Mousawi family arrived in the area from their native Lebanon well over a century ago, but the traditions and values of the old country have certainly lived on.

Sam spoke to The Advocate a short time ago about his new nickname.

“My family and Lebanese friends say, ‘yalla’ to me so often that my Skippy mates thought it was my nickname,” he said.

These Young Professionals At The Pub Are Talking About Cryptocurrencies

TEXT:

A troubling new trend is sweeping the licensed premises around Betoota’s Financial District according to many local publicans, who say that the young men who frequent them are only capable of talking about cryptocurrencies at the moment – and nothing else.

Dennis Coolidge has owned the Dolphin & Squid Hotel opposite the Betoota Stock Exchange for close to a generation and he confided in The Advocate that he only ever hears conversations regarding the online pseudo currencies at his bar now.

Stating categorically for the record that he doesn’t mind what his patrons talk about, it’s just that he’d noticed this trend more than previous ones.

“I mean, it’s all they fucking talk about, mate,” he said.

“From one end of the bar to the other, it’s Bitcoin this, Bitcoin that. Every conversation I overhear is about these computer coins and how they trade them,”

“I even got a Coinbase account myself, but I still can’t make any sense of it. Not that I care, it’s just weird that these young suitcucks are only able to speak about one thing now.”

Echoing Mr Coolidge’s sentiments was a local young professional, who was able to confirm to The Advocate that he is only able to speak about cryptocurrencies at the moment.

Banker-turned-mixed-touch-scrum-half, Sam Pontsford, said that his lust or the online trading market was started after a friend invited him into a WhatsApp group where they discussed topics aligned with trading cryptocurrencies.

Since that last in May, he’s never looked back.

“So yeah, now’s a good time to buy Ethereum,” said the 28-year-old.

“But don’t worry about all that scaremongering coming out of China, don’t worry about that,”

“That’s just JP Morgan shorting the market, it’ll recover just you wait.”

Pontsford said all of that without being prompted by our reporters, who originally asked Sam about the Cowboys finals hopes.

“I can’t talk about that right now. Litecoin is the new Bitcoin. Load up now. I’m actually thinking about making my own cryptocurrency, call it the Betootanese Peso or something. Shit’d be cash.”

Thoughtful Grey Nomads Put UHF Channel On Back Of Caravan So Truckies Can Easily Abuse Them

TEXT:

An elderly home-owning Betoota Ponds couple set out on the trip of a lifetime earlier this month with no set destination.

Norm and Beryl Funk sold their pool cleaning and stationery business and traded a life of stress and pay rates for a life spent on the road, chasing dreams.

But before setting out, the sexagenarians were thoughtful enough to put their UHF channel on the back of their late model caravan so truck drivers and everyday Interior Australians can abuse them for their driving.

While most truck drivers use channel 40 as a default when moving between towns and cities, the Funks said that they’d be staying on channel the whole time as to not miss any expletive-riddle criticism.

“It’s all part of the journey,” said Norm.

“We plan on driving about 10kph slower than the speed limit, meaning trucks can overtake us but when they do, we’ll speed up so they can’t. We don’t want to get stuck behind six decks of dehydrated steers,”

“And when we do, we want the person driving the truck to be able to call us horrible names and threaten to run us off the road. Even the jackaroos, they should be able to do it when we cut them off when they’ve got a gooseneck full of camp horses behind them. So much culture.”

The Advocate reached out to a number of local truck drivers for comment on the Funk’s open-mic policy and the feedback our reporters received was unanimously positive.

One truck driver said he relishes in the opportunity to abuse grey nomads for almost killing him and the stock he’s hauling.

“Can’t wait to call Norm a, ‘gibbering old cunt’ somewhere out on the open road,” said the trucker.

“Or Beryl a, ‘a blind old lunatic’. It will be nice to finally get it off your chest rather than taking to them with a tyre iron in the next town,”

“It’s a good policy, it should be a legal requirement.”

Man With No Defining Personality Traits Wins A Few Laughs By Drinking Out Of Shoe

TEXT:

A local bloke, who otherwise wouldn’t be remembered as a party guest, has stolen the show at a local house party for a couple of minutes by doing a shoey out of his damp skater footwear.

Jase Hollingworth (31) isn’t well known for his one-liners, taste in music, or general knowledge, but he is really good at frantically dropping to a knee in the middle of a dance floor and binge drinking alcohol out of his pungent footwear.

The “shoey” is a ritual popular in Australia where the drinker either removes their own shoe, or nominates a friend’s shoe to be used as the vessel. The shoe is tilted and the entire contents of a can of beer are poured into the shoe’s opening. Once the beverage has settled, the beer is drunk by tipping the shoe up to the mouth and chugging it. The drink most commonly used for a shoey is beer, however other alcoholic beverages are also used.

In Jase’s case, he has even been known to drink his good mate Wingnut’s urine out of a shoe, if the house party is particularly loose.

Australian Formula One racer Daniel Ricciardo, surf rock band The Dune Rats and extreme surfers The Mad Hueys are all well-known for their high profile shoeys – however when it comes to suburban house parties, the shoey is usually championed by the bloke who isn’t offering much else.

“[laughter] did you see Jase do a shoey?” asked one of the girls, Phoebe.

“Was that guy’s name Jase? I didn’t know who he was” says Georgia.

“His shoe was pretty gross-smelling. I hope he doesn’t get sick”

With Eagle Rock scheduled to come on next in the Spotify playlist, it is believed Jase will be the first bloke to drop his pants and show his jocks, complete with the odd damp patch from his last trip to the urinal.

Local Bloke Watches Monday Night Block Once And Vows Never To Watch Q&A Again

TEXT:

Devoting many of his Monday nights to the highbrow delight that is the ABC’s Q&A programme, a local network engineer had his world turned upside down last night by the nation’s most popular prime-time show.

Sam Dunkeld told The Advocate that he was preparing his prepackaged lasagne dinner in the kitchen while he listened to Nine News playing in the living room – because it’s ‘entertaining and fast-paced’ compared to the ABC and lesser networks.

“I enjoy that they have stories like dogs saving babies from hot cars and stuff. Swiming cats and the such. But they also have serious ones like ISIS and wars,” he said.

“But I always make sure to watch Q&A because it makes me feel like I’m keeping up with what’s happening socially and politically. It’s pretty boring sometimes, like the Star Wars prequels, but I always power through,”

“But I forgot to change over last night and I ended up watching Imparja all night. It changed my life.”

What the husky 26-year-old kicked the back door of his mind open, like when a 16-year-old first discovers there more to Bob Dylan than out of tune signing and disjointed lyrics.

From the first moment Scott Cam, host of The Block, welcomed him to the broadcast – he was hooked.

Through this was the first episode he’d ever seen of the working man’s Four Corners, Dunkeld said he’d never watch Q&A again.

“I could just turn my brain off and be entertained,” he said.

“Whereas when I watch anything on the ABC, it’s like being back at school again. Some nights I just want to switch off and have a laugh or two. Scott Cam looks like the kind of person who’d buy you a pot of Carlton and want nothing in return,”

“He’s like Tony Jones but for blokes who don’t own sandals.”

Local Neurosurgeon Says He Still Hasn’t Mastered Cutting A Mango Up

TEXT:

A popular young neurosurgeon at Betoota Private Hospital has spoken of the difficulty he faces in cutting up mangoes, saying it’s often easier to cut up someone’s head.

Brendan Windsor [pictured with parrot], explained to The Advocate that he either leaves too much flesh on the seed or ends up chopping into the seed itself.

“Very difficult, it is. To cut up a mango that is,” said the 29-year-old.

“Give me a golfball-sized tumour on the medulla oblongata and I’ll have that in the specimen tray going to pathology before you can say purple monkey dishwasher,”

“But yeah, give me a bag of mangoes to cut up and I’ll make a cunt of myself straight away. My mum is real good at it, but I reckon she’d be hard-pressed to do what I do on a daily basis. They only let you fuck up once, then they basically take your tools away for good.”

Echoing the medicine man’s sentiments was his older brother, John, who says he’s very proud of what young Brendan has achieved so far in life, being a 29-year-old brain surgeon and all – but come summertime, they keep the mangos away from him.

Laughing as he recounted a time last summer when their father publically pizzled Brendan for fucking up yet another mango, John said it’s funny how he’s trusted to save lives and perform miracles but simply cannot be trusted around the yellow stonefruit.

“Brendo cut up a mango for the old man and what he served up looked like shit,” he said.

“He’d pierced the skin about six times so the juice leaked out everywhere and the seed had about a kilo of flesh hanging off it still,”

“Dad just went ham on him saying he’s a fucking enigma, with his pet parrot and all. But yeah, love him but keeping the bloke away from mangoes some November is a fucking imperative.”

Trendy Local Cafe Owner Spends Morning Milking His Almond Trees

TEXT:

Danny Jogmann opened the Tungen Min Røvhul cafe in Betoota’s Old City district last summer and since then, the Danish-inspired eatery has become a local institution among the city’s cultural elite.

Offering traditional Danish foodstuffs like beer, chocolate, cigarettes and beer, Jogmann says business is booming – but that doesn’t mean he’s got any time to relax.

The 39-year-old spoke to The Advocate just a short time ago to share with our reporters his daily routine.

“We sell a lot of almond milk based coffees, probably more than any other cafe in town,” he said.

“That means I’m up by 4am each morning to milk the almond trees. I head out on the four-wheeler and bring the trees in from pasture, sharpen the scoring knife and flank spay the tree,”

“It’s a filthy job but I’d do anything for my customers.”

Many of the woolly-haired man’s customers appreciate the extra effort he goes to each morning, saying that they only get their almond-milk coffees from the Røvhul.

Known in the local cafe community as ‘Røvhuls’, Mr Jogmann’s loyal customers have garnered a cult following themselves.

They’re the cream of the cultural crop and often act like they’re above a lot of people.

Just last month, a Røvhul was struck in the head by a full can of Emu Export thrown from a passing vehicle as he out the front of the cafe.

While he made a full recovery, the man is said to be a bit different after the whole experience after having his brain plug ripped out of the wall by an angry motorist.

Local Girl Briefly Toys With The Idea Of Putting Arms Through Sleeves Of Jacket Draped Over Shoulders

TEXT:

A popular local fashion blogger has spoken of how she once considered putting her arms through the sleeves of a jacket draped over her shoulders, but ultimately decided against it.

Amy Caldwell, of Betoota’s trendy French Quarter, told The Advocate that she was waiting for a taxi the other night outside the Exchange Hotel in the Old City district when a stiff, chilly wind began to howl.

“My teeth were chattering and I was literally frozen to the core,” said the 24-year-old fashionista.

“Never in my life have I been that cold. Colder than ice I was – but then I remembered I had a jacket draped over me. It was almost frigid enough for me to actually put my arms down the sleeve holes,”

“Almost. What’s the point in wearing a jacket if you’re not just going to hang it over you like emergency workers drape blankets over people who’ve just survived a natural disaster?” she asked.

In a recent survey conducted on Caldwell’s own blog, close to 90% of all ladies jackets in the wider Diamantina community have never had an arm put down the sleeve holes.

Disturbing reading says Amy, who also made the point of explaining that the morning after she woke up from that chilling evening in the Old City, she’d developed a bad cough.

“I’m pretty sure I got sick from getting so cold that night, but I just couldn’t bring myself to wear my jacket properly. It can go from stylish and cute to frumpy and grump very quickly.”

Disbelief As Newly-Relocated Commercial Pilot Reveals He’s Not Married To A Hostie

TEXT:

Recently-relocated Betoota pilot, Captain John Scibson (55) has shocked the town today by revealing that his wife works in a career that has nothing to do with aviation.

After keeping to himself for a couple months, the regional commercial flight captain was spotted yarning to a few of the locals at the Lord Kidman hotel yesterday for the Cowboys vs Parra match.

After surprising everyone by proving that he was, in fact, a Parramatta Eels fan – it wasn’t nearly as shocking as what he revealed to the barman and surrounding patrons.

“Yeah, the wife has just started work at the Royal Hospital…” Says John, while finally letting down his guard and getting to know the locals.

Local grazier, Jack Pearson had to interrupt.

“Sorry what?” he said.

“Your wife isn’t a hostie, or a pilot herself”

John acts surprised – “No? She’s a surgeon”

The entire pub sits in silence. The barman, Kev, probes further.

“Is this your second wife or something? Did you meet her on a flight?” asks Kev.

“Nah I meet her through friends, twenty years ago” says an increasingly puzzled John.

The bar remains tense with an atmosphere that suggests everyone feels like they are being lied to.

“Did she used to be a hostie?” asks another regular, Sharon.

“No. I haven’t ever been romantically involved with a hostie, even when I was single” he retorts.

John continues offering more information, but struggles to make any lasting friendships as most of the pub already distrust him.

CHILLING: What would happen if Betoota was nuked by North Korea?

TEXT:

Based upon North Korea’s most recent nuclear test, a bomb of the same yield would all but destroy our bustling inland metropolis – according to a popular website.

NUKEMAP is an interactive map using Google Maps and unclassified nuclear weapons effects data to project what might happen to a location should it be attacked with nuclear weapons.

This morning, our reporters set the crosshairs on The Advocate’s offices on Daroo Street to see where the devastation would extend to.

What our reporters found makes for chilling reading.

“Basically everyone would die, yeah,” said a computer person who works downstairs in graphics.

“See, this is your house. You would die pretty much instantly, which I pretty choice in my opinion. You wouldn’t want to be one of the people that writhe around in nuclear fallout for hours until they finally die,”

“You be one of the lucky ones.”

From the crude graphic on this reporters computer screen, it looks as if the entire town would be wiped out – save for a few streets in Darook Heights and the Outer East Side.

So with that, Kim Jong-Un has to power to wipe our desert community from the face of the Earth at the flick of his supple wrist.

We here at The Advocate sincerely hope he doesn’t.

Pub Banter Gains Momentum As Two Alpha Males Turn On Each Other

TEXT:

What was always going to be a rather heavy session has now been cranked up a few more notches than initially expected, it has been confirmed.

As a group of local pisspots hit the pub this windy Saturday afternoon, a solid turn out from the first suggested kick-off was a good sign in the front bar of the Lord Betoota Hotel.

As the afternoon grows darks and the lads grow 4 of 5 schooners younger, the light-hearted but hurtful banter begins to flow gloriously.

However, this afternoon is a little different, as two of the most prolific real life trolls in the social circle have turned on each other, and it’s just so fucking good.

Dubbo (30) and Rhino (27) are both renowned for their acid-tongue chat, but it is not often that they aren’t complimenting one another. Today is different.

“Did you get dressed in the dark today, mate?” Rhino asks Dubbo, to a uproar from the unexpected by very excited witnesses.

“You look like a youth church leader with that cute little green button-up”

As the crowd roars, Dubbo’s eyes begin glinting with a malice.

“You can talk, you look like something I drew with my left hand, cunt”

Even the eavesdropping bartender is left in a state of hyperventilation as the entire pub witnesses a very rare clash of the titans.

“Yeah well you you look like something your mum should have wiped off with her left hand” Rhino responds, with a little bit more venom than everyone was expecting.

With the tone now set for an entire evening of severe roasting, the rest of the group are encouraging the hostility between the pair at any given opportunity.

“What do you reckon of Rhino’s new haircut” asks one of the boys, offering Dubbo an alley-oop. Dubbo goes for the throat.

“I reckon he looks like someone who’s missus left him for an NBL player” he spits, bringing it a bit of painful truth to the sparring session.

Rhino admits a temporary defeat and makes tracks for the bar, before coming back with eight Betoota Bitters for the table, with one that has been spiked with two shots of Absolut.

Local 35-year-old wondering why Triple J doesn’t appeal to him anymore

TEXT:

A socially-progressive yet musically regressive local alpaca breeder has been left wondering why each time he tunes into Triple J, he doesn’t like what he hears.

Now in his 35th year on this god-forsaken rock affectionately known as Earth, Peter Monkton told The Advocate that the national youth broadcaster was ‘ten times better’ back in his day and that ‘the station should go back to being what it was like in 2005’.

“These Ben & Liam people, I don’t know about them,” said the alpacaman.

“They’re not very good and they don’t really get what it is to be a Triple J breakfast person. Bring back The Sandman I say. Fuck it, let’s bring back Helen Razor because she knew her garage rock revival better than anyone,”

“Helen was the first Australian broadcaster to play The White Stripes. I mean, she basically brought The Strokes Down Under all by herself,”

“I just want things to go back to how they were.”

However, representatives from Triple J responded to The Advocate‘s queries regarding Mr Monkton’s comments.

From what our reporters were able to establish, Australians such as Peter no longer fall under Triple J’s target demographics and some criticism people over the hill should be expected.

“We don’t aim to please everyone,” said one Triple J producer.

“We aim to attract and entertain young people. The fact that there’s a veritable tidal wave of online criticism targeted at some of our presenters such as Ben & Liam is testament to that fact,”

“At the end of the day, they’re just kids. The cunts are barely 20 and they don’t really know who they are yet. We hope they find their feet but if they don’t, there’s always FBi or 4ZZZ.”

Young Couple Regret Buying First Home After Only Getting 100 Likes Between Them

TEXT:

A hard-working local millennial couple has revealed the horror that dawn on the day after buying their first house when they only received 100 collective likes between them on their various social media posts.

Proudly showing off their humble new three-bedroom South Betoota home, Dennis and Amanda Munro though they were in for a rainstorm of positive comments and a veritable fountain of likes.

But it seems the wellspring of well-wishers had run dry for the pair.

Some of their so-called friends pointed out that Amanda’s father, a local cardiologist, must’ve had a hand in them buying a house.

Others made illusions to Dennis’ mother’s family, who’ve owned land in the Diamantina district for generations.

Either way, nearly all respondents to the various social media posts were ‘snarky’ and ‘snide’ in their assessment of the Munro’s life milestone.

“I don’t get it,” said Amanda.

“Buying a house when you’re only 26 should be applauded but everyone just either ignored it or said my Dad paid for it,”

“Oh my God! He only gave us the deposit, he didn’t pay for it!”

Equally as bemused by the apparent shunning was Dennis, who told our reporters that it hurt that his friends call his new wife an ‘acre chaser’ despite them living in town.

He also spoke of the heartbreak he suffered waking up the morning after purchasing the property to see he only had seven likes on the photo.

While he initially agreed to be interviewed for this story, Dennis was too distraught in the end.

More, tragically, not coming.

Tech Start-Up Office Feeling Immediately Threatened As Company Hires First Woman

TEXT:

Once touted as the next tech hub of South West Queensland, Betootacone Gully ultimately failed to attract a large tech company needed to boost the local economy.

But one town’s loss is another man’s treasure.

One start-up the district did lure in was Sunplantia, a company that helps outdoor plants make the transition to indoor life – and with it came a whole troupe of young intelligent men.

The office culture was second to none, the envy of the entire gully.

Until Samantha Cashew was hired earlier this week.

Since then, the levels of male horseplay and general non-consequential misogyny are at an all time low and with it, lower office moral.

“She hasn’t even worn a skirt once and she always looks you in the eyes until you look away,” said Sunplantia project manager Peter Gillpeck.

“And she like full-on tells me that some of my ideas are bad,”

“The whole buzz around the office is just different. We went for work drinks last and she just sat at the end of the table drinking Tooheys Red eye-balling us. What the hell is her problem? The office is so much different now.”

However, disturbing details have emerged following a short interview with Ms Cashew, who shed some light on the shocking allegations made by her male colleagues.

The 26-year-old HR graduate said she’s just being herself.

“Yeah, you get boys like that in the start up world,” he said.

“They’re so used to understanding everything that when they can’t, they feel threatened. Well, I guess none of these World of Warcraft veterans understand me – or women in general,”

“Just comes with the territory, I’m not concerned.”

Local Jet-Lagged Man Only Has The Energy To Tell People He’s Jet-Lagged

Returning from the other side of the planet with wild stories of the frontier, a local traveller crashed out around 8AM this morning after a marathon 30-hour journey home from London.

As a result, Betoota Grove-resident Harley Hawthorne is jet-lagged beyond all comprehension.

“I’ve just been on an aeroplane, in economy class, for close to two days,” he said.

“So yeah [laughs] I guess you could say I’m jet-lagged. I haven’t even showered, let alone slept! God, it was a trip from hell. Don’t get me started,”

“I reckon it’ll be a few days until I feel up to doing anything!”

On the receiving end of Mr Hawthorne’s jet-whine are the various men and women loosely associated with the 26-year-old voice artist through his WhatsApp groups and living conditions.

Speaking candidly to The Advocate, a friend of Harley’s told of an unending stream of mild complaints and general malaise coming through as notifications on his phone.

Lindsay Scott explained that he first thought there was something wrong with Hawthorne, but after discovering that he was only jet-lagged, his mind was put at ease.

“You’d think he’s the first person to be in transit for 30-hours,” she said.

“But if you didn’t know that, you’d think he was dying or something. It’s just a never ending series of messages that tell the group how long he’s travel and how jet-lagged he is,”

“We get it. Please call the Governer-General and ask him for a medal or something. You and the other 400 people on the plane have basically survived a day on the Eastern Front fighting the Bolsheviks.”

‘Make houses cheaper!’ says Millennial that just preordered a $1829 iPhone

A local agency person has lashed out at everyone, including homeowners, for making houses so unaffordable for young people – despite spending nearly $2000 on a new mobile phone this morning.

Damien Longhurst works at a boutique, bespoke and creative agency in Betoota’s Old City district. He does something on a computer and makes life difficult for copywriters and anybody vaguely removed from the creative process.

But he feels that he deserves to own a home in a part of town that he feels he deserves to live.

“Yeah sure, I could buy in Betoota Plains or Buttville on the edge of town, but I have designer reading glasses I don’t really need and make an impact on the world through my extensive work as an account person,” he said.

“I want to make an investment but I just can’t afford to save up a deposit. Life has gotten so much more expensive than it used to be in my parent’s day,”

“It’s just not fair.”

However, Longhurst’s 61-year-old manager has other ideas.

Speaking candidly to The Advocate, Singh Johnleton [a local advertising demi god] said that people such as Damien were ‘part of the reason why Donald Trump’ won and the ‘world is going to hell in a handcart.’

“I’ve got news for that cunt,” he said.

“When I was his age, I saved and worked. Saved and worked. I fucking earned it,” said Johnleton.

“It boils my blood when you’ve got these four-eyed computer jockeys complaining about how much of a cunt their life is. Well guess what, mine was a cunt as well until I got lucky,”

“Fuck me, this entire conversation has got my blood pressure through the roof. Fuck!”

Mr Johnleton then told us to leave his office while he sufficiently composed himself to walk out and fire Longhurst on the spot.

“I’ll pay the unfair dismissal settlement, I just want him out of here.”

Highway Patrolman Cuts The Small Talk And Just Says He Pulled You Over For Speeding

TEXT:

According to a recent survey, most conversations with police on the shoulder of a highway start with the eternal question:

“Do you know why I pulled you over today?”

The answer is invariably the same around the country.

“Ah perhaps because of the speed, sir?”

And the answer to that rhetorical question is always:

“Yes. I’ve clocked you today at 193kph in a 110kph zone. At this moment sir, you are under arrest for dangerous driving.”

However, one overly polite highway patrolman from the Diamantina Highway Patrol [DHP] has broken with protocol recently and cut the small talk from the interactions he has with local hoons.

Constable Walter Marlow has been walking up to the open windows of speedsters he’s caught and replaced the aforementioned eternal question with out of his own.

“Are you eyes fucking painted on, cunt?” Constable Marlow would ask.

Nine times out of ten, he doesn’t get a verbal response – just an agape mouth and a dumb look on the face of the driver.

“Because I’ve just clocked you at about a fifth of the speed of sound in a hundred zone! Get out of the fucking car and give me your licence, you fucking lunatic.”

A number of complaints have been filed with the DHP, where they’ve ended up on Superintendent Sam Green’s desk.

He spoke to The Advocate a short time ago about his foul-mouthed Constable.

“I reckon it’s good,” he said.

“No more dick pulling and open-ended questions. Just straight to it. No wasted breath,”

“He’s not being reprimanded so if there’s nothing else you want to talk about, then this interview is over.”

Known well around the Old City district’s nightspots and day-drinking watering holes, Greg often gives it a red-hot-crack over the weekend before slithering back into himself like a wounded snail’s eye come Monday.

“But now I’m feeling normal again,” he said.

“So I’m celebrating by injecting a few cold, cold Betoota Bitters into me right now. Not too many as to feel disorientated in the morning, but enough keep my hands steady and mind running smooth,”

“Ah well, here’s to feeling good again.”

Though he laughed off suggestion that he’s in serious danger of slipping down the backside of the bell curve into the life-destroying abyss that is an alcohol addiction, Greg said he’s in control and just out to have a good time with his friends down at his local.

However, many of the locals at Greg’s local, The Gorilla Couldren on Summit Avenue, told The Advocate that having one day off a heavy alcohol binge each week often constitutes an alcoholic.

“Yeah, oi,” said one punter.

A South Betootanese woman who slammed her the front door closed to parents’ Dennison Street Californian bungalow earlier in the year has been traced to Bondi – The Advocate can reveal.

Through a four-part investigation into the missing young lady, our reporters checked her various social media accounts daily – only to discover them riddled with images of Bondi shot facing north from the famous Icebergs megastructure on the southern end of the open sewer affectionately known as Bondi Beach.

Jessica Talbot, a wayward but ultimately dependable local 23-year-old, is said to have arrived in the Bondi area only a month ago but already her life is centred around Icebergs and the culture surrounding it.

Speaking exclusively to The Advocate via a reverse charge telephone call, the impressionable Virgo said the best way to let people know where she is and lives is to put it on social media every second day.

“I’ve got a morning social morning ritual now,” she said.

“First, I get up really early. Way earlier than all those bottom feeders and perverts who live in the city and out in the bush. I put my morning walk on the Instagram story and if the sunrise is especially good, I’ll actually go ahead and [Insta]gram it,

“Then if I’m having a drink after work or something down at the RSL or club or whatever you call that part of Icebergs that isn’t Icebergs, I’ll put that on the story as well. I always try to cross-post to Facebook and Weibo whenever I can,

“I just want people to know where I live and how beautiful it is.”

Local Office Person A Little Bit Too Excited For The Start Of The NFL Season

“He’s been throwing that ball up in the air all day and telling people to ‘go long’ while he goes to throw the ball,” she said.

“It’s amazing he hasn’t broken anything yet. I kind of hope he does. Hits a computer with that fucking ball of his so the boss’ll blow up at him,”

Builder Shocked As Apprentice Comes Back From Bunnings With Tartan Paint, Box Of Bright Sparks

TEXT:

A local builder was left bemused this week, after the apprentice returned with his impossible request.

Brad Holmes, a middle aged joker from Norwood in Adelaide, chuckled to the other tradies on site when he asked the young fella to pop off down to Bunnings and get a tin of tartan paint and a box of bright sparks.

He laughed with the other blokes as the 17 year old apprentice James Davis zoomed off to the North Betoota Bunnings in his one tonne Mazda ute.

“Hahaha fuck imagine his little face when he gets in there and asks for a box of fucking “bright sparks?” Holmes said to the plumber.

“These young blokes are so impressionable, aye. He just left without even asking what the fuck tartan paint is.”

The laughter turned to shock however, as Davis returned sometime later with the requested goods completely unaware of what had just happened.

“Here we are boss. Tartan paint and a tub of bright sparks. Is that what ya wanted?” Davis asked.

Holmes started pissing himself before examining the goods much to the confusion of the apprentice.

“It turns out he found the stuff fuck me dead. He has no idea what ‘tartan paint’ means and Bunnings has some fucking gross green shade called tartan paint now? Who the fuck woulda guessed,” Holmes said.

“Oh and bright sparks is some new fucking cleaning product that the dipshits directed him too,”

“Jokes on me I guess. That little trip cost me 90 bucks and and an hour of his wages,”

The builder said that he won’t make that mistake twice and will be sending Davis down to the Roads and Maritime Service next week to get a Wheel Barrow Licence,”

“Yeah that definitely is not a thing. So he will return with his tail between his legs next time for fucking sure.”

Report: The Boys Looking Shmick In Their Rented Tuxes At First Ever Black Tie Event

TEXT:

A recent report shows that the boys actually scrub up alright when they have to.

Sources close to the group are reporting that the boys are looking deadset schmick in the tuxes they rented for tonight’s engagement party at the Betoota Surf Club. The boys, who decided to “go all out for Jace and Saz’s thing”, have rocked up just before the speeches, in accordance with “climax theory”.

“Lotta talent here tonight, boys,” said ringleader and former fullback George Harb, doing up his jacket and checking his bowtie as he exited the Uber that brought the boys to the party. “Lotta talent.”

The boys’ efforts did not go unnoticed, with various great-aunts stating they look “very smart, yes” and even bride-to-be Sarah Haines confessing a wandering eye. “The boys are looking schmick as,” she enthused. “I’m so impressed. Yeah, they scrub up really good.”

Her fiance, Jason Trindall, is equally taken with how good the boys are looking this evening. “I knew something was cooking,” said the tie-less host. “but full credit to the boys, they kept it under wraps.”

At time of press, one of the boys could be seen running an unlit cigar under his nose, and promising they’d smoke it later on the outside balcony.

Office Grot Sweeps Lunch Crumbs Off Desk And Onto The Floor

TEXT:

A polite but charmingly unkempt local tax accountant is once again the ire of the office today after he sweeping his lunch crumbs off his desk and onto the floor.

Known mostly for his happy-go-lucky disposition and a ‘hilarious’ disrespect for the Australian Tax Office, Colin Peterson explained to The Advocate that he often leaves the floor under his desk looking like a painter’s radio.

“It’s not my job to clean the floor,” he said.

“But it is my job to keep my desk clean, so I think I’ll killing two pigeons with the same stick – if you know what I mean,”

“But that pork roll was deadly. Deadly messy. Think I got a big bite of paper out of the last chomp, not feeling that flash right now. Anyway, that’s what I get for coming back to work after lunch on a Friday! [laughs] Seriously, though. I’d knock my boss out if it didn’t mean I’d lose my job.”

One of the 29-year-old’s coworkers expressed her mixed feeling for Petersen in a short interview with our reporter.

Jennifer Caldwell, a junior accountant at the boutique Old City District financial firm, said that while Colin is ‘really funny’ and ‘handsome’, she feels his utter contempt for even having one iota of cleanliness in his life makes him hard to be around.

“Look, Colin and I have a bit of a history, but I could never see myself getting chonged by him on a fulltime, monogamous agreement,” she said.

“He’s just too messy. Not his personal hygiene or anything, just the attitude that ‘it isn’t my job’ to clean the floor and that he’s ‘creating local jobs’ by creating mess for people to clean up,”

“But if he sorts that part of himself out, I wouldn’t need a bottle of rosé on a warm Friday afternoon just to start giving him the eye.”

Ubers Surge To 88.7x After Police Start Roadside Testing For Cocaine In Affluent Local Areas

TEXT:

For a number of years, the residents of the leafy East Betootanese enclave of Betoota Links have enjoyed the unbridled privilege on not knowing they even had it.

But according to local police, some of that privilege has ended.

From last night, police from the East Betoota command began roadside testing for cocaine – as well as alcohol and illicit substances such as cannabis, methamphetamine and MDMA.

“Not a moment too soon,” said Inspector Gary Rowlands.

“For too long, you’ve got this bagged up yuppies driving about town and we basically had no way of stopping them, save for searching their person and car – which requires a warrant without probable cause,”

“But now, we can basically fuck these people up at our discretion and my discretion is to fuck these people up.”

However, in response to this police blitz on the under-educated, over-employed minority, German ride-sharing application, Uber [French word for ‘tuk-tuk’], has seen a surge in demand for their services.

With greater demand, comes tighter supply. With tighter supply, comes higher prices.

In fact, two local ‘smooth-boys’ told The Advocate that they saw prices surge as high as 88.7 times the regular fare – something they say is ‘utterly repugnant’.

Danny Kosche and Nick Maloush, both cereal [sic] entrepreneurs, lashed out at the pricing model of the tech start-up.

“This shit is not cash,” said Kosche.

“It’s fucking silver change. Yuck!”

Maloush was also scathing in his assessment.

“I don’t speak to reporters who went to public school. Go away.”

Uh-Oh! Andrew Bolt Chased To Local Dam Face By ANTIFA Protestors

TEXT:

Outspoken right-wing commentator Andrew Bolt has been chased through the streets of Melbourne this afternoon by a gang of anti-fascist thugs hell bent on glitter-bombing him again.

But Bolt wouldn’t have a bar of it.

Rather than let the gutter-dwelling communists catch him unawares, the barrel-chested South Australian tried his level best to outrun his assailants.

After a running gun battle through Richmond and Hawthorn in Melbourne’s lawless east, during which Bolt is said to have shot up to six of the left-wing goons chasing him, they caught up with him a short time ago at the Maroondah Reservoir Park in the capital’s far east.

“What is it you want?!” screamed the 57-year-old as he stood on the edge of the dam wall.

“I’m merely exercising my right to free speech, much the same as you are! If you kill me now, you’re no better than the forces you say you’re fighting!”

Given the option to surrender himself and be glitter-bombed or jump to his death, Bolt punched one last activist in the throat before throwing himself from the dam into the churning spillway below.

The Sun-Herald columnist was last seen on the banks of the Watts River about a kilometre from the reservoir coughing up water and cursing softly under his breath.

Local Breakfast Television Presenter Vaguely Remembers A Time When He Was A Real Journalist

TEXT:

Being one of KBBL Betoota Imparja’s breakfast television presenters is a rare privilege bestowed upon a chosen few – one of those being Brett Gallway.

Each morning, the 49-year-old rises early and runs for an hour around Barcoo Park in the South Betoota, exclusive, leafy enclave of Danish Town while he listens to podcasts.

Arriving home in time to enjoy a slice of toast and a mild argument with his half-asleep wife, he’s out the door and on the road heading into town before he knows it.

It’s at these moments he has alone driving to work that he looks back fondly – and vaguely, on a time when he considered himself to be a real journalist, not just a mouthpiece for the one percent and their shareholders.

“Back in 1996, when I was 21 I think, I was fresh out of an ABC cadetship and was keen to cut my teeth somewhere interesting,” he said, looking out of his seventh-story office window down at Imparja’s Old City headquarters.

“So I went to Sri Lanka with a camera, tape recorder and a whole heap of good luck. For a time, I was the ABC’s man on the ground there. As a young journalist, there’s nothing more exciting. Being far, far away and knowing what you’re doing is important not only to you and your audience – but for the people around you,”

“Now I just laugh at memes on camera and deliver a fired-up piece to camera about something vaguely controversial whenever the EP thinks we’re losing ratings to the rival stations. It pays the bills, puts the kids through school and keeps the wife happy, so I guess I should be happy.”

The Advocate reached out to KBBL’s news director for comment, but was sent back a press release for Peter FitzSimons’ new book.

Local Used Car Salesman Asks ‘What Is This Shit?’ After Stumbling Upon QI Rerun

TEXT:

Greg Klimt is a self-described simple man.

He enjoys supporting his beloved Dolphins and maintains a diet almost completely devoid of fruit and vegetables.

“I don’t like them, I like smokey BBQ sauce and potato gems for tea,” he said.

“Wash ’em down with a Betoota Bitter tin and a hearty bowl of Viennetta dessert cake. That’s how I live my life.”

Which part of the reason why the 39-year-old father was bemused by popular British game show, QI, that appeared on his television on his way to 7Mate.

“What the hell is this shit?” he asked himself.

“I don’t understand what they’re saying. Is this supposed to be a comedy show? Braileene! Get him here!”

“Get a load of this shit. They’re asking questions but no cunt is giving him a straight answer, they just try and be funny but fuck it up most of the time, I think.”

Having seen this programme before, Braileene explained to Greg that the show is like Wheel Of Fortune but for smart, socialist people like the yuppies in Betoota’s Old City district.

“Just ignore it, Greggy. Take a breath. I’ll pan-fry you some fish fingers in a minute,” she said rubbing his head.

“I taped Storage Wars for you too, hun.”

Regional University Student Attends 10AM Early Morning Lecture In Best Pair Of Pyjamas

TEXT:

After failing to get into her favourite sandstone university, Emma Hutchins thought she might as well give up on becoming anything worthwhile – her dreams of changing the world as a young lawyer were dashed before they even began.

That was until an older, wiser family friend told her of the veritable Xanadu that is regional tertiary education.

So with a tentative and pensive first step, the friendly, confident young lady packed her bags for Betoota, where she won a place at Cottrell College studying communications at Diamantina Bowen University.

“At first, I was very sceptical of studying at Diamantina U[niversity] but I’m ultimately glad I came out here,” said the 21-year-old.

“It’s so laid back, all the lecturers and support staff know my name. Plus all my friends on college are from such different backgrounds. Some are so simple, it’s an affront to tertiary education that their applications were even opened,”

“Others are far too clever to be here. It’s a great mix. I’m in my third year now and I wouldn’t change a thing.”

But her most favourite thing about studying at Diamantina is that she can pretty much wear anything she wants to lectures and tutorials.

That freedom also extends to nights out with friends at the many licensed venues around town, where wearing comfortable clothes is often heavily smiled upon.

“I’ve only got like four classes and two lectures a week,” said Emma.

“And that’s even if I go to the lectures. But the ones I need to go to, I just jump out of bed and into my uggies then head out the door. Don’t even brush my teeth most of the time. If I want to a big city uni, I’d be on the train or bus or stuck in traffic,”

“Wearing nice clothes, too. Expensive shoes that hurt and suck. This is literally as free as you can get. Mum and Dad are hours away, cheap drinks and drugs. Simple but ambitious boys. Heaven.”

Local Same-Sex Parents Relax After Spending Father’s Day Destroying Family Values

TEXT:

Local life partners and civil unionists, Wayne Carmichael and Adam Wolfe, told The Advocate this Sunday afternoon that they and their two adopted children enjoyed a long, hard day at a South Betoota park destroying traditional family values.

“We went to the park after lunch to kick a ball around and attack marriage,” said Wolfe, a 34-year-old high school mathematics teacher.

“Afterwards, the kids wanted an ice cream so we stopped at the BP on Steward Street and got them each a Maxibon and some traditional family values,”

“Now we’re at home relaxing after long day of exercising our religious freedom. Wayne is cooking dinner tonight, thank Christ.”

Wayne himself was equally as pleased about how the day panned out.

“I got socks for Father’s Day [laughs] again! [laughs] Adam got a scientific calculator! [laughs] That’s what we get for letting the kids pick their own presents this year!”

“My own father got some PowerBall tickets from my sister and another year’s worth of disappointment from me and Adam,”

“So nice.”

Destroying family values and cheapening the act of marriage are popular pastimes for many local same-sex parents and today is often enjoyed publically on Christian holidays such as Father’s Day.

A polite, homely lesbian couple from Betoota Ponds made waves last year by letting their adopted teenage daughter complete her own tax return.

“It’s all in a day’s work for us same-sexers,” said Adam.

“Dismantling traditional values and laws that stem from an era when public executions were an acceptable form of punishment and also doubled as a wholesome family outing.”

Toddler Gives Dad An Extra Special Public Meltdown For Father’s Day

TEXT:

A local 38-month-old completely lost his mind this morning in a popular French Quarter cafe in a touching tribute to his Dad, who’s celebrating his third Father’s Day today.

Quincy Ryder, 36, received the tantrum just after 11 am in front of friends, family and perfect strangers after he had to explain to his son Dakota that the cafe didn’t serve the fish fingers he wanted for brunch.

Mear seconds after the harsh reality of a fish finger-less breakfast dawn on Tinkerbell Early Childhood Centre student, he started screaming.

Speaking to The Advocate with his upset child cradled in his arms out the front of local institution, Pisse Dans Ma Poche, Mr Ryder said all he wanted for Father’s Day was a bit of ‘God damn peace and quiet’.

“He didn’t sleep very well last night and I thinks he’s just tired,” said Quincy.

“Maybe he’s hungry or maybe he’s shit himself? I don’t know. You know who else didn’t sleep very well last night? Fucking me,”

“Hey! Hey! Dakota! Quiet! I’ll get you some fish fingers for dinner, just stop screaming… Please!”

However, when asked by our reporter to explain his behaviour, a belligerent Dakota refused to answer any questions.

“Fish fingers! Fish fingers!” screamed the popular three-year-old before bursting into tears again.

“I want my Mum!”

“I hate you, I want fish fingers!”

Local Sheep Farmer Still Has It In For P!nk Ten Years After She Criticised Mulesing

TEXT:

Even the very mention of her name can send one local sheep farmer on an hour long tirade about how US songbird Pink almost doomed the entire wool industry.

Just over a decade ago, the 37-year-old American called for a boycott of Australian sheep products over concerns she had about animal cruelty stemming from mulesing – the practice of removing folds of wool-bearing skin from around the breech of a sheep to prevent flystrike.

Michael Rust runs nearly ten thousand head of sheep on his spread about an hour south of town and even though P!nk later retracted her comments, he’s still got it in for her.

“Don’t get me started on that lunatic,” he said.

“Fucking coming over here and telling me and every other poor bastard running sheep in this country that we’re a pack of cunts and deserve to have our livelihoods taken away from us,”

“Nah, I’m not finished. Pink and her fucking PETA mates should stay in America where they actually put up with shit like that,”

Rust continued his rant for some time, the contents of which are not fit for publication.

However, his youngest daughter Amy fondly remembers the time when the controversy was fresh in the news and her father was just starting to feel the Pink’s wrath.

Amy said her old man even went as far as banning her music in the house and the family Falcon.

“He caught my sister Sam listening to a Pink song on her old Barbie-themed CD player and he just went ape,” said Amy.

“The CD player looked like a pink soccer ball. I remember Dad coming in from the cattle yards, back when we had cattle. He’d been smoked a few times by some rank cleanskins, so he was already in a bad mood that day,”

“He recognised the music and he just picked that Barbie CD player up off the kitchen bench, went out on the deck and punted it with his steel-capped Volleys halfway across the front yard. Sam just sat there and accepted that it was her fault and we as a family moved on from it.”

Grown Man Still Terrified To Walk Through Local Park After Dark

TEXT:

Though the shire council has made numerous efforts to improve the lighting in Apex Park, one local man is still terrified of walking through there alone after dark.

Gregor Madden, a defenceless literary agent, often takes the long way home around the park after the sun goes down.

Especially, says the 28-year-old, if he’s been binge drinking with friends in the Old City district.

Apex Park divides the French Quarter from the Old City and its name has long been synonymous with muggings and general knife crime, which is why Madden won’t risk it.

“I’ve been mugged walking through that park so many times,” said the French Quarter resident.

“Come home just shitfaced from the Old City after dark, just looking like a wounded gazelle. One minute, you’re stumbling down the path, the next some hood is waving a Stanley knife if your face asking for your phone and wallet,”

“It cuts off about 20 minutes, but seriously. It’s just not worth it.”

Back in 2013, Gregor was held up at knifepoint six times in one month – each time losing his wallet and phone.

That was until he started carrying a snub-nose .38 down the back of his trousers for protection.

A short time after that, Gregor wounded a mugger before chased him o into the woods, where he repeatedly shot the person who tried to rob him.

Police then allege he decapitated the man and stuck his head on a spike at the French Quarter entrance to the park.

Ultimately, he was found not guilty by reasons of self-defence.

“I got sick of it, I got sick of being scared all the time,” he said.

“The cops took my gun away, though. So until they give it back, I’m still too scared to walk through the park after dark.”

Laughter As Man With PhD Repeatedly Claims He’s A Real Doctor

TEXT:

A recent graduate from Diamantina Technical College has been called out today on his habit of referring to himself as a Doctor.

Sam Wilson whose paper titled: “Bountiful mind: memory, cognition and knowledge acquisition in Plato’s
Meno earned him a Doctorate in Philosophy, has been relishing any opportunity to give himself the honourable title.

“Hi, I am Sam, Dr. Sam now actually,” he laughed last night at a dinner with some acquaintances.

The 37-year-old man, who often alternates between wearing a trilby and a flat cap, was reportedly eager to discuss his paper with any of the people at the dinner he hadn’t met before.

Local electrician Phil Anderson, whose girlfriend is friends with a friend of Wilson’s said he was on the verge of slashing his wrists at the dinner table a few minutes into the pompous chat.

“I’m pretty happy to talk about a lot of things really. I actually read quite a lot and my old man was a high school teacher so I have a pretty decent grasp on tertiary dinner table conversations, but this was terrible,” Anderson said.

“He would say something quite vague and then do this laugh that sounded like he was choking on his own saliva and I just had to smile and nod.”

Towards the end of the dinner, Steve Phelps, who is more of an acquaintance than a friend, asked boldly after a few glasses of red:

“You aren’t really a Dr though are you, Sam? It’s not like you’re a Professor or Colorectal Surgery for example? You don’t know your rectosigmoids for your regular run-of-the-mill sigmoids? Do you?”

“Well, I actually am champ,” was the retort from Wilson quite angered by the comment, although he know’s he really isn’t,”

“Alright mate, if you say so,” said Phelps, who nodded sarcastically before asking what everyone had on this weekend.”

Girlfriend Doesn’t Understand How Sick Boyfriend Is

TEXT:

Despite the fact that everyone comes down with a cold at some point during winter, Jack Derwin is certain that he has it particularly bad.

The local accountant who came down with a serious case of man flu has spent the last couple of days “bed ridden” and whining to anyone who will listen about his ill health.

“Man, I’m honestly pretty sure that I’ve actually got the flu. This isn’t just a normal cold. I have the shivers, and aches and everything. I can’t remember having it this bad ever,” he said.

Although Influenza is completely different to the cold which Derwin has, he says that he can’t see himself getting into work for the next few days.

“I can’t get out of bed mate.”

All of the women in Derwin’s life told us that he tends to carry on something terrible.

Although his mum, sister, girlfriend and female colleagues all get on with life as normal when they are sick, Derwin is under the belief that they don’t understand how sick he is.

“He had the worst cold he ever has had last year…. If you listened to him you would believe he has been Tuberculosis or Ross River Fever. I’m tolerant but it’s hard work,” his girlfriend said.

Betootan Doctor Anthony Goldstein confirmed to the Advocate that the illness he treated Derwin for was definitely a common cold, he let the young man leave under the impression it could be the flu.

“Yeah you gotta let these young fellas think it’s a bit worse than it is so they just take the DR’s certificate and leave.”

Local Barman Longs For The Day When He Can Say Thank God It’s Friday

TEXT:

People like Wavell Rhodes are the unsung heroes of Friday afternoons.

They pour the beers and clean the glasses. Good your potato gems and party pies and wishes you a warm farewell as you leave the bar just before close.

Wavell Rhodes is a barman, the last of a dying breed of South Betootanese youngsters who don’t mind rolling up their sleeves and having a go.

But the 24-year-old horticulture student who moonlights as a Betoota Hotel barman has a confession to make.

He hates Fridays.

“One day, I just want to be able to be on the other side of the bar of a Friday afternoon with my squad,” he said.

“Don’t get me wrong, I love my job – but I don’t like Fridays. They remind me of what I’m missing out on. Seeing all the happy faces, the mates catching up and all the shouting, hollering and whatnot,”

“I long for the day when I’m out of uni, working in a garden with the blazing hot sun on my back and a cold schoon of Betoota Bitter waiting for me down the pub. Is that too much to ask?”

However, Betoota Hotel manager Jock Campbell explained to The Advocate that Rhodes is able to take any Friday off he’d like, he just can’t drink where he works.

Unfortunately for him, most of his friends have been barred from the two other drinking holes in Betoota’s Old City district, leaving him with very few options besides the Betoota Hotel.

“Yeah, but nah look,” said Campbell.

“I can’t be having my staff pissing where they drink from, you know? In saying that, I know that Wavell’s mates are banned from most places in town but that’s not my problem,”

“The Fridays he has taken off, he just ends up in a garage with his crew crushing tins and sucking back a few hot ones and doesn’t have a very good time. It’s a Catch-22, I think?”

Hay Fever Ads Herald The Beginning Of The Worst Time Of The Year

TEXT:

Move over winter! There’s a new cunt of a season in town!

That’s according to Denise Roland, a polite researcher from Australia’s peak scientific body the CSIRO, who said recent studies have indicated that advertisements for hay fever medication often mean that spring time is just around the corner.

But that’s where the 67-year-old’s interest in spring ends.

“It is the worst time of the year for many Australians,” she said.

“That’s because many Australians suffer from hay fever allergies, which is the single most unpleasant thing a middle-class white person can experience, besides consequence for their actions,”

“Which is why we start seeing ads for medications such as PollenCuck and FluFrottage around this time of year. Winter isn’t over until you see a model jam the nozzle of a nasal sprayer up her nose and watch her go for gold.”

The scientist’s sentiments were echoed by a local hay fever sufferer, who explained to The Advocate that she often loses the will to live until around November each year.

Sandy Brimingsham, a elderly gent who has no sense of smell, wanted to make it clear that his nose gives him no grief at any other time of the year, just spring time.

“It’s not that bad having no sense of smell, I don’t care about that,” he said.

“What I do care about is not feeling like I’m about to die each time I venture out on my walks, which are often through a flowering field of canola like you see in the hay fever commercials,”

“But yes, the ads are working. I will be popping down the chemist shortly to stock up on PollenCuck.”

“Mate, he’s given us all a big tongue lashing,” said a fellow chef.

“He reduced one of the bartenders to tears, calling him a ‘cricket cuck boy’ and other horrible things. Bloke loves his cricket, though. He’s a legend in my book, but he should really pick his targets,”

“Other than that, the prick’s just had this fucking grin on his face the whole time. Go to pick something up from the pass? There he fucking is smiling back at you. Drop off some dirty dishes to the dish pigs out back, there he is, smiling at you from the kitchen. I can’t fucking stand it.”

When asked to provide comment on his recent behaviour, Sayeed said was brief but to the point.

A message from The Betoota Advocate to The Onion’s Editorial Board

TEXT:

On behalf of The Betoota Advocate, I’d like to extend a warm welcome to the team from The Onion.

As one of the last, great, American news media organizations, we thank you for your kind words and wish you safe passage through our vast and beautiful home. Make yourself at home and, under the conventions of the ANZUS Treaty, you are entitled to anything we have so please take whatever you like as you so gracefully have in the past.

That being said, there are some matters of housekeeping that need to be addressed.

As we understand the offices of The Onion are based in Chicago, which was made popular by Home Alone – and Chief Keef.

One of the cultural differences between our home in the Queensland desert and the Windy City is that it’s considered rude and/or socially unacceptable to wound or murder your fellow man with an unregistered firearm in our country. Even in a hot-blooded act of passion, it is simply frowned upon here – which apparently is not the case in ‘Chiraq’.

Should you feel the need to perform a gangland-style execution while you’re here, we ask you to shoot another member of your team — as the last time an American shot an Australian to death it almost sparked an international incident and reflected quite poorly on your decaying society as a whole.

Local police and ambulance crews will be on standby for your visit as, statistically, your very presence puts ordinary Australian lives in far more danger than automobiles or religious extremism.

Another quick issue to address is the problem many tourists such as yourselves may face and that’s the topic of travel insurance and health care. Please don’t fret if you manage to arrive here without organising any as our universal healthcare system automatically covers you should an accident happen.

We can assure you that if you’re hurt or injured while in Australia, you will not be left to die in the corridor while a family member weeps over a seizing corpse that once housed your soul and being because, for some reason, it was your employers’ duty to provide you with health insurance. And they didn’t.

Australia is a proud nation of migrants built on the back of the peoples of our dispossessed firsts nations – in a manner very similar to the United States. And while we are not free from the news cycle and hostile political climate created by your US media culture, we still hold our heads high when we talk about gun control and Medicare. It’s also comforting to know that Australian men can see why it is not okay to wear swastikas in the street.

But enough about that, let us tell you more about The Advocate.

As a small and independent regional newspaper from far-west Queensland, we pride ourselves on reporting fair and just news with the authenticity that rivals only the salt on the sunburnt earth that surrounds us here in the Queensland Channel Country.

Having been established in the mid-1800’s, we are arguably Australia’s oldest newspaper and have always taken pride in our ability to walk in both worlds: regional and metropolitan news. In recent times, our popularity has grown immensely as result of a bold move to create an online revival for our publication at the advice of a youth intern from one of the sandstone universities down south.

Without fear or favour, our publication strives to go places others won’t go. We broke some of the biggest stories of 2017 reporting that can only be maintained through fierce independence. We are yet to bow to any of the media families currently acquiring the remaining publishers around the world like low-tier European powers carving lines through the new world of North Africa in the 1800s.

When the Packer Family [not Green Bay] came knocking, they were treated to a whirlwind evening of coin toss gambling and Angus steak – but left with nothing more than the soap and towels they stole from The Betoota Hotel.

Rupert ‘Buck’ Murdoch tried his luck in mid-2014, but negotiations failed to regain momentum after Wendy Deng was ejected from the Dolphins Club for being intoxicated – to which Buck responded by thrusting a pen into the throat of the bouncer ushering his then-wife out.

It is through luck and dignity that we have managed to avoid acquisition, which is why our editors, founders and readers were disgusted to hear the claims coming out of Chicago earlier this week.

The Onion newspaper is a deeply tragic insight into the failings of ‘old media’, a direct mouthpiece for Hilary Clinton in 2016 and, in hindsight, the magnifying sound board for modern fascism and political populism.

A news organ that, despite your positivity, has simply not kept up. It is one that will ultimately follow the route of other business powers from their glory age such as Kodak, Blockbuster and the White House. It goes without saying that when this happens, and you experience the pain felt by the once proud auto workers of the neighbouring 313, the blame will not rest on your poor management but teenage children who are apparently creating fake news in Macedonia and Albania.

That being said, it would be unwise for you to not make hay while the sun shines. Your visit to Australia is a good example of this – and what better place than the Sydney Opera House. We can think of no better place for comfortable white social commentators to stand upon a soap box in front of other white social commentators. The acoustics are magnificent – it’s almost like an echo chamber.

Enjoying A Run To IKEA Clearest Indicator That Man Is Getting Old

TEXT:

Activities like pouring his heart out to a complete stranger at three in the morning on a school night are slowly becoming less attractive to one local youth, who’s slowly discovering he’s not one anymore.

Speaking to The Advocate this morning at IKEA’s grand opening in Betoota Ponds today, Andrew Cowell and his partner Linda Jones said that when they lived in the big city, going to the Swedish megastore was more of a chore.

But after turning 28 earlier in the year, the couple now say they enjoy visiting the homeware giant and even find it fun to put the furniture together when they get home.

“Linda has always liked visiting IKEA and blowing half her paycheck on shit that I have to put together when I get home,” said Andrew.

“And the times when I’d get dragged along on a Sunday afternoon, I always had to fight the urge to throw myself under a Pajero in the carpark before we went in. Not now though, now I can see the merits of this activity.

The turn around has been amazing, says Linda, who once feared she’d lose Andrew to a life of midweek drinking and Sunday mornings spent throwing up on himself in the shower.

The 24-year-old analyst at PricewaterhouseCoopers Betoota told The Advocate that it took years of subtle conditioning and behaviour correction to get Andrew where he is now.

“I’ve always been an old soul, at least that’s what my parents tell me,” said Jones.

“IKEA is like heroin to me, even though I’ve never tried it or would try it. All the cheap options, the Scandinavian design and convenient locations. I just love this place,”

“Whenever I took Andrew here when we lived in Brisbane, I could see the contempt in his eyes. I’m glad we made the channel-change and moved out to the Diamantina. Life’s good.”

Local Private Boys’ School Principal Dares Any Pupil To Turn Up To School In A Dress

TEXT:

The principal of an exclusive local private boys’ school has taken time out of his busy morning to explain to The Advocate that should any of his students feel the need to turn up to school out of uniform, he will feel the need to punish them for it.

Dr Robert Tintern has been Principal of The Barnemouth College for nearly a decade and he prides himself on providing a safe environment for his pupils to grow from curious boys to confident men.

However, he draws the line at letting them wear a dress to school.

“Yes, I have seen those narrow-minded advertisements on the television for the ‘No’ campaign,” said Tintern.

“While we do promote and actively support the ‘Yes’ vote, one part of that ad did not sit well with me. The part about letting boys wear a dress to school. That cake is a bit too rich for my Longreachanese palate,”

“So I wanted to reiterate today that wearing a dress to school at Barnemouth is not acceptable and should any pupil try to test me on this, they will be given a Saturday detention or a pack drill from their housemaster. You will be punished.”

When asked whether the school would make exceptions, Dr Tintern said ‘no’.

“If it isn’t in the uniform shop or clothing pool, you can’t wear it to school,”

“If you do, you will be punished.”

Office Brunch Grinds To A Halt After Discovering Man From Accounts Doesn’t Watch Game of Thrones

TEXT:

An office of Betoota’s least interesting people enjoyed an early lunch this morning at a popular French Quarter cafe, where to their disgust, they discovered someone in their midst doesn’t like or watch Game of Thrones.

Sam Caldwell, an accounts executive at a failing boutique South Betoota marketing firm, made the shock confession earlier today at the Pisse Dans Ma Poche cafe on Rue de Putain.

“What do you mean? What do you do on a Monday night?” scoffed Gloria, the firm’s receptionist.

“The fuck is the matter with you?”

The shock turned to anger after the 28-year-old revealed he enjoys watching the ABC of a Monday evening, where he gets off on joining in the conversation on Twitter.

Often with his beagle by his side, Sam curls up on the couch with a bowl of pasta and a red wine while he unwinds to the docile tones of Tony Jones and other closeted communists.

“I’ve read the books, so I already know what’s going to happen,” said Sam.

“Plus, they’re better than the television show, which I proudly boycott,”

“Honestly, though. I’m the social pariah of the office because I don’t watch a television show? Please.”

Local Law Student Stands Accused Of Taking Moot Court Too Seriously

TEXT:

A law student at East Betoota Polytechincal has lashed out at suggestion and rumour that he’s been taking moot court too seriously, The Advocate can reveal.

Michael Bonham-Page, son of local barrister and convicted drink driver Winston Bonham-Page SC, is in his sixth year of Bachelor of Laws study at the private university and is currently taking part in a compulsory mooting module this semester.

However, many of his peers have sniggered and laughed behind his back during the mooting itself – where they say the 26-year-old is ‘taking it a bit too seriously.’

“He shouted, ‘My Lordship! Objection!’ when he didn’t understand the question the judge asked him,” said one fellow student.

“One time he even wore a tie to moot court. What a fucking try hard!”

“Michael doesn’t even need to try in law school. He’s whiter than John Candy’s arse cheek was a week after he died, more Protestant than old seven-wife John Singleton and better connected to the wider Betoota legal fraternity than the local cocaine merchant!”

“I mean, just chill out, mate. You’ll be fine. Spare a thought for the rest of us who have to earn it.” said the student.

But Michael says he feels hard done by, telling The Advocate that his classmates don’t understand the type of pressure he’s under at moot court – because all the judges are his father’s friends.

Explaining that his performance is often parroted back to his Dad at the golf club of a weekend, the reformed pothead said there’s nothing lame about caring.

“I’m just trying to do my best,” he said.

“But yeah, I’m pretty fucking slow to be honest with you. All I wanted to do after school was smoke cones and eat potato gems. But now my dreams are over because I’m nearing the end of law school,”

“Which means I might actually have to practice law soon.”

Referee confirms he can hear local man screaming at him through the television

TEXT:

In what started out as a line of questioning to determine if a local referee’s eyes were ‘fucking’ painted on, has turned into a touching and sad moment.

One prominent rugby league referee, who asked to remain anonymous, has told The Advocate of how he hears every cruel and unfounded criticism a local man makes whenever he tunes in to watch games he’s officiating.

“Yes, I can hear everything he says,” said the referee.

“And what he says isn’t always nice. Over the weekend, he said I missed a forward pass, a knockout and a penalty. Well, I’ve got new for you, buster! It’s harder when you’re out in the middle!”

“So fucking run at me, cunt. You’ll be eating your fucking potato gems through a feeding tube after I’m done with you!”

But for Jeff Hartley, a marginally-employed-French-Quarter-sandwich-maker and the local man in question, he’s glad the referee can hear what he screams at the television – because it’s the truth.

Speaking from the heart, Hartley explained that it’s good that his voice is being heard.

“If he can fucking hear me, then why does he insist on shitting the bed each time the Titans touch the ball?” he said.

“Fucking riddle me that. Anyway, if he’s listening now, open your fucking eyes cunt and stop being so bias towards my team!”

“It’s enough to put a man in an early grave, it is.”

Family Photo From 1985 Still Haunting Local Father

In what describes as a ‘momentary lapse of reason’, the now 57-year-old says agreeing to a happy snap with his newborn nephew back in 1985 is a decision that still haunts him to this day.

“I was going through a really heavy goth phase back then… obviously,” he said.

“At the time I thought I looked like the cat’s pyjamas. But by modern standards, I realise that cat’s don’t wear pyjamas.”

When asked by The Advocate why he keeps the photo around if he hates it so much, the creepy Capricorn said his kids find it funny.

“That’s the worst part, the kids won’t let me forget,” he said.

“Every morning, I walk past this black and white stranger holding a baby and I just die a bit inside,”

Mr Gomez then put the photo back on the telephone table and let out a heavy sigh.

A boxing prophet who decided to grace The Betoota Hotel with his presence this afternoon has spoken of how he knew Floyd Mayweather would win in the tenth round against Conor McGregor.

Not only did he know, upon the fight’s competition, Brett Coffey told anybody who’d listen to him that he told them that Mayweather would win before the fight even started.

“I said, before this whole thing started, that Floyd would win in the tenth round and it’d be by a technical knockout,” he said.

Overexcited Mate Who Bended Through To McGregor Fight Won’t Stop Shadow Boxing

A South Betoota software developer has taken time out of his busy Sunday to demonstrate to friends in their living room just how Irish fighter Conor McGregor will defeat Khabib.

“He’s going to get him with a Celtic cross,” said Jesse Massey.

Jesse, who hasn’t slept from last night and is trying his very hardest to remain vibrant and not drift off to sleep, says that the Celtic cross is gonna fuck Khabib up, and that Conor is gonna win this thing, because he knows who Conor is.

“And that’ll be that. Conor is a fighter’s fighter. A true professional. This is what he a got Diaz with [right jabs] and this is what he got Alvarez with [judo chops with the left].”

“Come here and I’ll show you. haha”

The 24-year-old then slowly displayed how the southpaw will win with the aid of a sparring partner he selected from a pool of his watching mates.

But after a knock in one of the undercard fights, the group’s attention shifted back to the television, and Jesse sat down on the couch, where he will likely fall asleep if not provoked by his friends.

Wallabies Fan Chuffed To Discover He’s Kiwi By Descent Before Bledisloe Showdown

A local banker says he’s thrilled and chuffed after discovering that he’s actually a Kiwi as well just hours before this evening’s Bledisloe Cup match between Australia and New Zealand in Christchurch.

Sam Watson-Smith, a mortgage expert at Diamantina Credit and Loan Union, thought he’d just check and see if he was a New Zealander ahead of the do-or-die match.

As fate would have it, the 23-year-old is a Kiwi by descent through his father.

“Mate, this is good news,” said Watson-Smith.

“Who would’ve guessed? My father was born and raised in New Zealand but it never struck me that I could’ve been eligible for a Kiwi passport? How good!

“So I reckon tonight I’ll get behind the All Blacks because they’ll probably win. However, if the Wobs get up, I’ll be just as happy because Australia is my birth country. I can’t wait for the game now!”

Despite the tragic news, the South Betootan plans to tip a few into him regardless.

The Betoota Dolphin’s League Club is showing the game at 4pm when all the hoopla starts and old white men throw their two cents on the ground.

Local Student Painstakingly Selects And Buys Novel He Knows He’ll Never Read

TEXT:

Tsundoku is a Japanese word for the literary affliction of buying books you don’t read.

Glenn Whittaker, a South Betoota TAFE English Literature student, has a bad case of the Tsundokus.

Taking time out of his busy Saturday morning of picking cannabis out of the carpet to ward off his hangover, the 23-year-old wandered into his local independent bookseller to have a gander.

However, he knows that whatever he ends up buying, it’ll just end up on his bookshelf untouched.

Almost every book that’s currently sitting on his desk, nightstand and bookshelf has a crinkle-less spine and a lack of dog-eared pages.

“He’s only hurting himself in the end,” said one of his lecturers.

“It’s hard to get a good read on Pynchon or Palahniuk from a SparkNotes summary. It’ll get you through a course but if that’s what you’re aiming at getting out of it, then why do it?

“It’s not like this diploma has any tangible employment benefits.”

But Whittaker was quick to hit back at his critics.

Telling The Advocate over a milky coffee at his favourite cafe slash bookshop, the typical Virgo scoffed and rolled his eyes through out the interview whenever his love of reading was questioned by our reporter.

“Ah, excuse me. I’ve been an avid reader my whole life,” he said.

“Cut my teeth on J. K. Rowling before I move onto more academic and challenging books, like the Alex Rider series by Anthony Horowitz. Have you even heard of that? I didn’t think so,”

“Hunter S. Thompson is my favourite writer. The movies they make of his books are cheap and tacky. I bet you’ve never read the Rum Diary but you saw the film? Yeah, it’s not a film, it’s a movie!”

A loud young man has reportedly woken up everyone he lives with overnight after returning home from a Betoota Links party, The Advocate has heard.

Kenyon Gibson arrived home to his French Quarter terrace sometime after 1 AM last night, where he proceeded to clip-clop across the floorboards in his Ariats like a Clydesdale according to one housemate.

In addition to his equine-esque footsteps, the 29-year-old reportedly shouted at the top of his lungs for no apparent reason before retiring to his room.

“It was absolute bedlam,” said housemate Greg Fordham, 46.

“He sleeps in the attic so he’s pretty much up and down the stairs all night until whatever he’s on wears off! So loud! First, he comes down for a glass of water or something, then he comes down for a piss,”

“Honestly. I know he’s three sheets to the wind but he’s taking the fucking piss. He should at least take his boots off at the door like most self-respecting cowboys do.”

“Somehow, after cooking and working in pubs for ten years, I haven’t developed a crippling addiction to alcohol,” he said.

“I know, right? [laughs] But yeah, so many of my colleagues would just knock off and prop themselves up at the bar and just drive half a dozen schoons into them before they’d even look up,”

“There’s a shortage of chefs at the moment because it’s an absolute cunt of a job until you work your way up the ladder. Sadly, a lot of young chefs just get wasted after their shift, when they could be working on their skills.”

Local Costume Party Deemed a Success Despite One Man Refusing To Dress Up

TEXT:

A renown local party pooper has failed to rain on a Betoota Ponds costume party overnight.

Tina Colon’s midweek birthday bash has been deemed a success after close to a dozen of her close pals turned up to ring in Thursday with a bang.

The shindig’s theme was ‘Wigs & Jigs’, which was a ‘bit how ya going’ for Mark Rogerson, who refused to dress up for the occasion.

“I mean, first Tina wants us to get wankered on a Wednesday and then she wants us to fork out money for a costume,” said Mark.

“How about you fuck off?”

“Just point me towards the bar and watch me make a cunt of myself. That’s how you party.”

Despite Mark’s negative views on people succinctly narcissistic to have a midweek costume party, the party went into the early hours and those who attended said it was a great night.

Tina spoke to The Advocate a short while ago over the phone and explained that she knew Mark wasn’t going to dress up.

“It was a great night,” she said.

“I got on the brain varnish prosecco and really cut loose. Things got a bit wild towards the end. My high school friend Kate went mad and the cops had to shoot her. Other than that, pretty drama free,”

“Oh yeah, about Mark. Yeah look, he’s a good bloke but fuck he can be a cunt if you stroke his cat against the grain. He’s good value, but. He tried his best to ruin the party, but it was still fun in the end.”

Local jetski owner puts finishing touches on new house with home bar

TEXT:

A reformed dolphin poacher had a soft-opening for his home bar to mild fanfare overnight at his Betoota Hills residence.

Situated on the ground floor of his recently-built Queenslander-inspired display home, Deverell Slacks told The Advocate that the entire build was centred around the bar and that the whole thing took him nearly 6 weeks from start to finish.

“Basically, I got inspired to make the bar when I found this slab of Jarrah in a local timber yard. The salesman assured me it was some of the cleanest Jarrah he’d ever seen,” said Slacks.

“From there, I drew up a few plans and got a quote. When they is started [sic] to build the house, we quickly had to add the home bar into the plans, which wasn’t easy but ultimately worth the money to redraw the blueprints,”

“So happy with it. The Big Mouth Billy Bass still gets a bucket load of laughs! Take me to the river! Wooo! Drop me in tha wawtar!! [sic]”

However, our reporter only counted three people at the opening, including herself.

While Mr Slacks played bartender for the evening, the only other patron in the venue was another local jetski owner named Gavin Berkmire.

When asked why he’d turned up for the opening, Berkmire said it was because he’s a bad drunk and has been barred from every other venue in town.

“Even the Chinese at the golf club won’t have me,” said Gavin.

“I put one of those yum cha carts on its side one night in fit of rage. Can’t remember, though. Apparently it was bad,”

“Anywho, glad this place just opened. Time to get wankered.”

Local Tailender Drops A Grand On New Bat

TEXT:

A local number 9 batsman has walked out of Wilson Sporting Goods on Mitchell Avenue a thousand dollars lighter after he simply couldn’t walk past this season’s offerings from Kookaburra.

Though he barely averages double figures, Michael Plug told The Advocate that the blame for that lies in his poor choice of bat last season – prompting him to make the purchase.

“I made the biggest mistake of my life last season and bought a Woodworm,” he said.

“While I initially liked how balanced the Wormy was and the weight distribution, I grew to hate that bat after a midseason slump last year that saw me get clean bowled and run out for a duck in for successive innings’,”

“But this new Kookaburra I got this morning, that should change everything. It’s like two inches thick and weighs more than a Les Paul. I’m going to be carting blokes around the park all summer; it’ll be grouse.”

However, the fourth-grade Dolphins cricketer has had his assessment on his batting performance challenged by his captain, who told The Advocate that Plug should be focusing more on his bowling.

Mark Funk explained that while he’s happy Michael is starting to take his batting seriously, he’s been selected as a bowler, not an all-rounder.

“If he can score a quick ten late in the innings, he’s done his job,” said Funk.

“But yeah, a lot of the batsmen in the team will be asking to borrow that new hunk of wood Plug’s got himself. For a bloke of Mick’s ability to drop a grand on a bat is just hilarious,”

“He’ll be using it to fruit ninja a few toilets this season I reckon. Bloke loves to smash a dunny after a bad day with the bat.”

Agitated man buying multiple packets of cigarettes in local 7/11 on PayPass denies credit card is stolen

A polite but flustered young man has denied allegations that he’s been using a stolen credit card to buy cigarettes.

Darren Mulvey, 32, was spotted at a number of local convenience stores yesterday evening attempting to purchase as many cigarettes as he possibly could in one PayPass transaction.

However, many shopkeepers grew suspicious of the agitated Gemini’s behaviour – which some witnesses describe as intimidating and irregular.

“He came into my 7/11 and demanded four packets of Horizon Blues very rudely,” said one local merchant.

“When the total was over the $99.99 PayPass limit, he told me to remove one from the order as, ‘he didn’t know the pin.’ That was when I became suspicious that the card was stolen,”

“That and I doubt his name was Penelope, which the card suggested.”

The Advocate caught up with Mr Mulvey at a local bus station just a short time ago, where he denied that the credit card he’d been using to buy the cigarettes is stolen and that his birth name is actually Penelope.

“Yeah, my parents full on named me Penelope, brus,” he said.

“Oi, but yeah, nah, fuck off would you with this stolen credit card shit, aye? I don’t need this stress. It’s my card, bro. Fucking look it up, mate,”

“Seriously, I swear on me nan’s fucking grave. It’s not stolen.”

Police from East Betoota have been able to confirm to The Advocate that a local mother had her bag snatched from her yesterday evening outside the Woolworths in the French Quarter.

Penelope Stevens wasn’t able to get a good look at the hooded youth who stole her handbag, but the veterinarian is helping police with their enquiries.

Man Jailed For Tricking Mate Into Having A Shot Of Black Sambuca

TEXT:

A South Betoota man was sentenced to serve a maximum of 12 months behind bars today with a non-parole period of six months after being found guilty of inflicting grievous bodily harm upon a friend during a night out at the Betoota Golf Club earlier this year.

Sam Frucor tricked a friend, who cannot be named for legal reasons, into consuming a shot of black sambuca – an Italian anise-flavoured, usually poisonous, liqueur.

In sentencing the 23-year-old, local Magistrate Helen Waterford said that a custodial sentence was required due to the shocking nature of the crime.

“The victim of this heinous act will suffer the consequences of it for the rest of his life,” said Waterford.

“Being tricked into consuming black sambuca is cruel, inhumane and degrading. Especially after the victim made it clear that he simply cannot stand it, that it’d kill him,”

“And Mr Frucor ignored that.”

Shortly after consuming the toxic substance, the victim’s eyes rolled back in his head and he went limp after losing consciousness.

Police alleged at the time that the victim then regained consciousness on the floor of the Chinese restaurant annexe of the Betoota Golf Club and threw up on himself until paramedics arrived.

Authorities later charged Frucor after interviewing the victim in hospital.

Unwed Millennial Couple Buys Home After Finally Taking Joe Hockey’s Advice To Get Better Jobs

TEXT:

Two former South Betoota bottom-feeders have kick-started their life by trading in their old low-paying jobs for high-paying ones.

Sam Finsbury used to break construction material into manageable pieces before throwing it into a skip bin for a living and his partner Amy Miller shot birds at the airport.

However, they’ve been able to buy their first property in Betoota’s recently gentrified West End district thanks to a little pearl of wisdom given to them by former treasurer Joe Hockey.

“It was really simple in the end,” said Finsbury.

“I just got a better job that paid like way more money. Plus, now I don’t need to take high-risk cash jobs from the boss like dumping asbestos somewhere in the middle of the night,”

“That and Amy got a way grouser job, so our combined income is now enough to buy where we think we deserve to own property.”

Sam is now a local orthopaedic surgeon with a private practice and Amy was recently promoted from an unlicensed pest control expert to a senior partner at Minter Piper Cubical Betoota.

However, Miller hopes to retrain as an anaesthetist next year so the couple can afford to marry, have children and be able to afford childcare.

“Honestly, if it wasn’t for Joe [Hockey] we’d still have bad jobs that only used to barely pay enough to keep us both alive,” said Amy.

“But we just got better ones that paid more, now our lives are better!”

Local woman reveals she wants to be taken back to Europe in touching Instagram tribute to continent

Sarah Coleman spent upwards of three weeks basking in the European sunshine earlier this month and now after returning back to her old life in Betoota’s dreary French Quarter, she ready to take another holiday.

“Ergh, just take me back already,” she captioned.

As the red, black and white Mercedes omnibus snaked its way down the range towards her French Quarter office, it suddenly dawned on Sarah that she’d used up all her holiday time and paid leave – meaning should she need another holiday, a resignation would be the only way.

“I don’t think I can make it to Christmas without another opportunity to recharge,” she said.

Stumbling upon freshly-cleaned public toilet current highlight of local man’s weekend

A local father of four has revealed to The Advocate this morning that coming across a freshly-cleaned public toilet has been the highlight of his otherwise dull weekend.

Betoota Ponds man, Dennis Wilmott, regaled our reporters regarding his experience today at the Grey Range National Park public toilets – where he said the facilities were ‘outstanding.’

“They’re the type of public toilet you wouldn’t visit first thing on a Saturday morning if you catch me drift,” said the 28-year-old as he winked and smiled.

“But after a Peter Stuyvesant and a long black, there was no stopping me. It was either the portaloo or behind a bush,”

“However, much to my surprise, they’d been recently cleaned and I was the first bag of shit to come across it. Seriously, though. As a married man with four children, it’s the small things like this that really make life worth living.”

Dennis’ sentiments were echoed by Mayor Cr Keith Carton Esq.

Mr Carton explained to The Advocate that the shire council has been working hard to improve local infrastructure and services such as the Grey Range National Park portaloos.

“While we know what goes on there after dark and we as a council do not condone it what-so-ever, the reality of the matter is that ordinary Betootanese folk such as Mr Willmott pay rates to enjoy clean facilities,” he said.

When asked by Thomas Brock if he could ‘borrow’ a cigarette, Sam Greenholm paused the conversation he was in to pull his Champion Ruby out of his top pocket and handed it to him.

However, Brock is a part-time smoker and has tried many times and failed to roll himself up some lung candy in the past.

“I didn’t want to be seen wasting this bloke’s tobacco,” said the 23-year-old.

“So I just asked him if he could be kind enough to roll one for me because mine always end up looking like a Twisty,”

“But he just put his rollies back in his top pocket and told me to fuck off back inside with all the other twinks. I thought a simple ‘no’ would’ve been enough but he took the opportunity to be mean. I let the manager know about it.”

But when The Advocate contacted Mr Greenholm for comment, he said he’s not running some sort of smoking Smith Family and that every time he goes to these ‘fucking’ gastropubs, he gets hit up by these social smokers that eat into his hip pocket.

“Every time the missus drags me down to some cunt of a place like the Goana, I get hit up for a smoke by some little smooth-handed free spirit,” said Sam.

“I’d had enough. I’m not Chrissie Swan, I’m not smoking for two. I told that bloke to fuck off because I’d had a hard day and I didn’t need that in my life,”

“He even asked me not to lick it. He wanted me to half roll it, let him lick it when it was in my hands still and then for me to finish rolling it. Can you believe the fucking balls on that bloke? Fuck me.”

Man fears his mother is being brainwashed by Minions memes after joining the Face Book

TEXT:

A semi-retired local mother has taken to social media this morning in an attempt to stave off the boredom often associated with home life.

Wendy Gondola, the owner-operator of popular French Quater hammock shop, Heroin Hammocks, has taken a shine to ‘Minions’ memes according to her son, Dylan.

However, Dylan is beginning to think that signing his mother up to The Face Book is beginning to have a detrimental effect on her.

“She likes and shares theses Minions memes that are inappropriate,” said Dylan.

“The other day, when I was out of reception driving up from Toompine, she shared a highly offensive and quite homophobic meme to my timeline. A lot of my friends saw it and rang to tell me,”

“I’m growing concerned that these stupid yellow man memes are beginning to brainwash my mother. She’s a pleasant and kind woman whose being led astray by these sociopaths that make the memes. Perhaps this was a mistake.”

But when The Advocate reached out to Wendy for comment, the nefarious Sagittarius said that we as a society ‘need to lighten up’ and that political correctness will be the death of us.

Speaking candidly to our reporter, Gondola explained that while she found the memes to be ‘hilarious’ and ‘classic’, she does admit that it’s at someone else’s expense.

“Of course I know there’s more than two genders, I have a QUILTBAG [Queer/Questioning, Undecided, Intersex, Lesbian, Trans (Transgender/Transsexual), Bisexual, Asexual, and/or Gay/Genderqueer] nephew, I think he’s my nephew or they could be my niece I’m not sure,” she said.

“Point is that I love him and I accept them for who they are as a person, not some archaic social construct. But these Minion memes, fuck me dead,”

“I literally piss myself looking at them. They’re fucking classic and so, so wrong. I love dark humour. Black Books with that dark-haired Irish fuck boy is my favourite show at the moment.”

Bride Demands Wedding Guests Have A Bit Of Fun In Lame As Fuck Photo Booth

TEXT:

Lauryn Prince is a busy 20-something who enjoys subverting society’s expectations about what young women should be and do on their wedding day.

That’s why the junior accountant from Betoota Heights has decided to do her nuptials her way and hire a photo booth for the big day.

“A couple of my friends have had them with the funny props like moustaches and stuff,” Ms Prince said.

“But mine’s going to be different. Really rustic. The big reveal on the night will be that I’ve bought ‘thought bubble’ chalkboards on Etsy for the guests to take into the booths.”

Ms Prince said each of the 150 guests including her 93-year-old grandmother would be required to spend at least 15 minutes in the booth and to paste the photos into the guest book outside.

“Clint and I really want our friends and family to be active participants on the day,” Ms Prince said.

“We’re spending like over $100 a head on them and it’s kind of the least they can do.”

Ms Prince said she was glad her evening calligraphy class was finally being put to good use.

She planned to hand-make the wedding invitations, including transcribing a poem she found on the internet asking the guests for money instead of wedding gifts.

Associate Professor Simeon Clarke from East Anglia University said studies revealed it was “less crass to ask for money using rhyming couplets”.

“A seminal German study in 2016 found the same request posed in prose yielded $50 less per head than a poetic demand for cash,” he said.

Local fool discovers shampoo doesn’t taste as good as it smells

TEXT:

Curiosity got the better of prominent local fool, Glenn Bexley, this afternoon after he popped the top off his PERT 2-in-1 shampoo and had a taste.

The marginally-employed real estate agent revealed to The Advocate that he always wondered what his shampoo would taste like, seeing as though it smells so delicious.

“I had to find out,” said the 38-year-old stay-at-home-son.

“So I just went with it. I took the lid off, which was quite difficult in itself, and drank about half of it. Some I swallowed, other parts I spat out on the floor,”

“It didn’t taste like it smelled. Disappointed, but currently full of pensive thought. Never again.”

Our reporter reached out to Mr Bexley’s parents for comment on the matter, where they said by this point nothing really surprises them anymore.

His father, Gary, told The Advocate that his son routinely does things that both annoy and bemuse him and this latest episode with the shampoo is nothing out of the ordinary.

“Just last week, I asked him to do the washing up and guess what he does?” asked Gary.

“He put all the china plates, cutlery, pots and pans into the fucking Whirpool in the laundry and put it on a heavy wash cycle. I mean, for fuck’s sake.”

“Last year, I told him to get his suit cleaned for his cousin’s wedding. I should’ve said dry cleaned, it’s my fault. But the moron put a suit through the Whirlpool as well. Then when it was done, he put it in the dryer. It came out looking like a medicine ball. My life is a bin.”

Veteran Substitute Teacher Sets The Tone Early Into First Lesson With Impressive ‘Oi!’

TEXT:

Mr S, as he would like to be referred to, has made it clear that just because Betoota High School’s 9C’s usual teacher has gastro, it doesn’t mean the next few days are going to be made up of spare lessons.

The bald veteran seat-filler of secondary education has let out the loudest ‘oi’ ever heard in by any of the rowdy students he has inherited this week.

As the classroom begins testing the waters to see how much they can get away with under this overly stressed hyper-masculine disciplinarian, Mr. S is quick to ensure them that he is not your average fresh-out-of-uni substitute teacher, and the only thing they can expect to come from this kind of unruly behaviour is their own tears.

“Back in your seats!” he spits, with the kind of aggression only ever seen in an educator who has been unsuccesfully trying to quit cigarettes for ten years.

“What’s your name? Andrew is it? You are up the front with me”

With a blatant disregard for any of the pre-existing predjudices that exist in this classroom regarding behaviour and reputations, Mr S is now turning on anyone that ‘he doesn’t like the look of’.

Another student, Sarah has never been in trouble in her whole life, but the pink streak in her blonde hair leaves her open for scapegoating.

“Who’s talking over there!?” yells Mr S.

“What’s your name. No, not you. The one with the pink”

“Sarah? Stand up”

The 15-year-old straight A student begins to sob as the ice cold Mr S makes her stand in the back corner for the remainder of the lesson.

Mr S continues his dictatorship right until lunchtime, where he decides that the entire class will not be joining their friends outside.

“You can’t just not let us go to lunch?” says the class captain, Anthony.

“Watch me” says Mr S.

Baby Boomer searches high and low for ‘Vote No Gay Marriage’ Facebook filter

TEXT:

Mortified at the prospect of same-sex couples being legally allowed to enter a loveless marriage such as his, a local sexagenarian has taken to Facebook to show his support for the ‘Vote No’ campaign in the upcoming postal ballot on same-sex marriage.

Each time Graham Monckton sees a young person show their support for the ‘Yes’ campaign by applying a filter over their Facebook profile picture, he recoils in disgust.

To counter out his petulant grandchildren, who’ve already shown their support via the marriage equality filter, the 69-year-old retired property investor began searching Facebook high and low for a ‘No’ filter he could put over his own.

“I couldn’t find one,” said Graham.

“Which I feel is unfair. I should be able to have an opinion and have the right to express it,”

“And it is my opinion that gay people shouldn’t be allowed to get married in the traditional sense. I don’t really care, but it’s the terminology for me, that’s what really gets my goat all giddy.”

But after trying to find a filter for close to an hour, Graham slammed the lid of his Compaq laptop down and went into the kitchen to yell at his wife.

Bartender’s heart warmed after smug wanker’s credit card is declined

TEXT:

Assuring the customer that the machine is not broken and after the customer blamed the bank, a local bartender’s heart has been warmed thoroughly seeing a terrible person’s credit card be repeatedly declined before his eyes.

Martin Cornhole clicked his fingers until Sam McKendy turned around and started to serve him.

“That was when I discovered he was a cunt,” said Sam, a food and beverage professional at a small Betoota Links craft brewery.

“Then he ordered drinks that are an absolute cunt to make. Two expresso [sic] martinis, a Guinness and two Margaret River shirazs, iced,”

“I know it’s my job to make drinks and put a bullshit smile on my face all day when inside I feel like beating half the customers to death with a length of reo bar, I’m also human,”

“So when this chinless 50-something burlap sack of human filth threw me, threw me the cunt, his American Express and it came up declined, I just fucking melted inside. Like a bar of Xanax and bottle of red type internal melting. It was fucking all-time, mate.”

From there, Mr Cornhole made Sam punch in the credit card number into the terminal. Still to no avail.

Then after it was declined for the 6th time, they tried another card. Declined.

Defeated, Martin asked another person in his party to pay for the drinks on the proviso his cards weren’t working.

“Him and I both know that he’s a fucking poser deadbeat,”

“But fuck, mate. There’s nothing better for a bartender than seeing a wanker customer having his card declined.”

Small Town ‘Buy, Swap And Sell’ Page Exclusively Used To Sling Insults And Organise Fights

TEXT:

The Emmet Buy/Swap/Sell Facebook page started out with pure intentions according to the administrator, but internal town politics and a perverted need to open old wounds quickly diminished any value from it.

Warren Kelly started the page to create a portal by which Emmet’s 17 000 residents could sell their unneeded possessions or pick something up for a bargain.

“It was good for a while,” remarked Warren, a retired grazier.

“But then the youth about town decided to take it upon themselves to hurl insults and say horrible things about one another,”

“Then the fighting happened. The bastards, they organise fights on the page. After the fight they brag about it, sometimes they film it. The last video I had to remove had a young man getting beat about the head with a dog chain. It’s a shame.”

Amid the chaos of the online community, Kelly pointed out that some trade actually does take place on the page.

Earlier this week, Django Tyson from nearby Yaraka traded a clapped-out whipper-snipper for a partial collection of Looney Tunes mugs.

Following that, Dennis Neckmann of Isisford bought three bald tyres from a Blackall cocaine dealer to decorate his front yard with.

“As the page admin, I’m confident we can get the discussion back to the buying, selling and trading of goods and away from calling each other terrible things such as ‘putrid dog’ and ‘cunt hole.’

“So, so vulgar.”

Local Bachelorette Swoons At The Sound Of Grown Man Opening Velcro Wallet At The Bar

Demi Munro describes herself as a lady of simple tastes and pleasures.

Cold rosé on a Friday night and pair of jeans that fight just right and so on.

So when she heard Dylan Carmichael, a used car salesman at Tyson Ford South Betoota, rip open his Ripcurl wallet down at the Dolphins Leagues Club last night, she knew she had to introduce herself.

“Nice wallet,” she said, edging closer to Dylan.

Think she was taking the piss out him, the 29-year-old raised his eyebrows and smiled with his lips pursed.

“Yeah? I bet you like nice houndstooth jacket, too? My grandpa died in it watching Wheel of Fortune if that also piques your interest,” he replied.

Brushing aside his obvious social short comings, Demi assured him that she was serious, that she loves seeing grown men with Velcro wallets.

“I bet you’ve had that same wallet since you were a kid,” she said. “I bet you’re really responsible and aren’t the type of train wreck male that loses their wallet every ten minutes.”

But Dylan hadn’t had this particular Velcro wallet since he was a kid – and he is the type of person who loses his wallet every ten minutes.

“That’s why I’ve got a Velcro wallet at the moment. Because I lost my old wallet on the piss last week,” he told our reporter after bumping into him at the urinal.

“What do I say?” he asked.

Our reporter then promptly told him to lie because that’s what all men inevitably do.

CATCH-22: “I Quit Social Media And Now My Life Is Great But I Have No Way Of Telling Anyone”

TEXT:

A local poon who enjoys working in an agency environment revealed to The Advocate via SMS that he quit social media on Monday and that since then, his life has improved a great deal.

However, without the aid of social media, he has no other way of telling his closest 900 friends just how good his life is without Facebook.

“It is a Catch-22,” explain Mark Cornholio, a local copywriter.

“While not having social media as improved the quality of my life remarkably, it all seems pointless if there’s nobody to tell that to,”

“It’s not like I’m about to start phoning and texting everyone again like it’s 2005. I’m not going to ring up all the fellas and tell them I’m doing a picturesque lighthouse walk over the weekend. Life just seems hollow without all the likes.”

In a study commissioned by the NRMA, receiving bulk social media likes for doing something as mundane as going to the gym or going on holiday is pivotal in fostering and nurturing the development of sociopaths and narcissists alike.

Both of which are important to the national economy, according to Roger Waters of the NRMA.

“Sociopaths and narcissists, such as myself, inject billions into the economy each year. Or at least we think we do. However, quitting social media can actually have a negative effect on the development of a young person in more ways than one,” he said.

“It’s rare for a Millennial to think of anyone such as themselves. Take a look at the Keep Sydney Open movement. You’ve got young people in the streets protesting over something that directly affects only them. I doubt any of them will protest for same-sex marriage because if they’re straight, it doesn’t affect them at all,”

“See what I’m getting at?”

Local Bloke’s Most Recent Brush With Law Serious Enough To Whip Out The Tarocash

TEXT:

A local scallywag who is well known for catching the eye of the authorities must have really fucked up this time.

Witnesses say that the bloke in question, Harisyn Kambouris (30) was looking especially flash at his most recent appearance at the district court.

“This is either high-range or assault” says Brodie, an acquaintance of Harisyn’s from junior football days, who is appearing before the judge for a low range himself.

“Fuck me, he might’ve done worse than that, though”

“Look at the haircut”

With a thin black tie and chesty black dress shirt, Harisyn would look more at place at general admission at Flemington, unfortunately the current circumstances are much more serious than a simple day at the races.

“He’s rocking the Tarocash” whispers one state prosecutor in the courtroom.

“His lawyer has told him to do that”

Over the course of the afternoon it was revealed that Harisyn was one of the blokes involved in the punch on outside the Betoota RSL on the bank holiday. He says he wasn’t really that good of mates with the blokes he was with, but he can’t stand seeing someone put the slipper into another bloke on the ground.

In his third appearance before the same judge, Harisyn has been not guilty of aggravated assault and urged to continue his work as a storeroom supervisor for Diamantina Supplements Plus.

Harisyn had taken his tie off before even leaving the government building.

White couple on Instagram with white teeth begin selling teeth whitening kits to other white people on Instagram

TEXT:

A prominent East Betootanese social media power couple shifted their entrepreneurial empire into top gear this morning after signing a lucrative content deal with a global teeth whitening brand.

The deal, worth in excess of  HKD$300, was forged last night during eleventh-hour talks via email with the teeth whitening manufacturer’s marketing firm based in Hong Kong’s Sheung Wan district.

Betoota Ponds residents Todd Willis and Becky Carmichael founded their online business, which uses popular social media platform Instagram to connect with their many followers, early last year and since then it’s undergone significant growth.

Now sitting at close to 20 000 followers, the couple now enjoys micro-influencer status – a title that allows the pair to enter into the lucrative online world of paid endorsements and ‘road tests.’

“This is just the beginning, what this space,” they said.

“We already have good teeth because we both come from high socioeconomic backgrounds and our parents instilled a great sense of oral hygiene in us,”

“So naturally the Nique Ta Dauphin teeth whitening kit was a natural fit for our brand because the company has the same wellness and sustainability ethos as our brand does. Our followers will appreciate this.”

The Advocate reached out to one of the couple’s local followers, who explained to our reporters that he’s been an avid devotee to Todd & Becky’s page for months.

However, he decided to be interviewed, saying only that his interest is much shallower than people give him credit for.

Battling factory worker wondering when politicans will start trying to win his vote

TEXT:

A West Betoota factory worker who depends upon weekend penalty rates to make ends meet has been left wondering when Canberra will start trying to win his vote.

Though he doesn’t want to undermine the importance of same-sex marriage getting through parliament, Glenn Munkey told The Advocate that it’s ‘kind of annoying’ that so much effort is being put into such an ‘insignificant’ and ‘irrelevant’ issue.

“Just legalise gay marriage and move on, there are more important things to fight over,” said the 29-year-old.

“Homosexuals make up less than two percent of the population. Wage earners make up nearly 80% of the country. Close to ten percent of that percentage are on the minimum wage,”

“I don’t want to belittle the struggle of gay Australians but Jesus Christ, can we just move on? Can somebody try and win my vote? I’m fucking broke as hell and neither Bill or Malcolm seem to give a shit. They’re both acting like they’re trying to win fucking New Farm or Darlinghurst over. Guess what fellas, they’re a world outside the inner city.”

The Advocate reached out to The Office of the Prime Minister and the Leader of Opposition for comment, but have yet to receive a reply.

Malcolm Turnbull’s secretary said he’d be too busy today with all the gay marriage business and Mr Shorten’s office explained that he’s in a meeting with the various trade unions for advice on where the unions stand on gay marriage, which will define his response.

Study finds the easiest way to tell if someone is vegan is to wait until they inevitably tell you

TEXT:

A groundbreaking new study into the cult of veganism has uncovered a disturbing new trend in which the easiest way to learn that somebody is a vegan is to simply wait until they tell you.

Australia’s peak scientific body, the CSIRO, released the paper earlier this morning at a Canberra press conference where the organisation’s spokesman outlined that it takes roughly seven minutes on average for a vegan to tell you that they’re vegan.

“It certainly came as a shock to our research team, let alone what the public thought,” said the government official.

“While it may have been easier in the past to learn somebody was a vegan by keeping close attention to what they ate, it’s now much simpler to just wait until they tell you themselves,”

“A vegan will tell you that they’re vegan, according to our research, after around seven minutes of first meeting you. Like it’s a badge of honour,  some sort of social and ethical Victoria Cross. We can’t see it changing anytime soon either.”

However, a number of leading local vegans have hit back at the federally-funded science club, saying that they don’t just tell everyone they meet that they’re vegan – they’re trying to educate people about their way of life.

Chrysoprase Epiphany [right] from the Royal Society of South Betootanese Vegans [RSSBV] lashed out at the boffins behind the study, explained to The Advocate that pigeonholing all vegans as ‘self-indulgent, narcissistic sociopaths’ is dangerous and inaccurate.

“People can just tell that I’m a vegan just by looking at me,” she said.

“Not because I look like Janis Joplin or smell like Bert Newton, but because of my glow. Meat is full of toxins and antibiotics that besmirch the good work your body does keeping you healthy,”

“Honestly, don’t knock it till you try it. I won’t apologise for trying to help other people help themselves.”

ISIS claim responsibility for local sushi train derailment

TEXT:

Popular Middle Eastern terror organisation ISIS has taken to social media this morning to put their hand up and claim responsibility for a local derailment at a South Betoota sushi train.

The duty manager of Clancy-son Japanese Canteen and Sushi phoned police just after 10 pm last night to inform them that a tragic derailment had occurred in the restaurant and that he needed the aid of the emergency services.

Police, fire and ambulance crews were dispatched to the premises, where it was established that the sushi train had indeed jumped off its tracks.

“It was horrible,” said a local firefighter.

“There was sushi everywhere. On the tables and floor. It’s quite hard for me to describe,”

“You had to be there. There was like seven of those $5 green plates on the floor and the fancy sushi was just ruined. I vomited on myself in sheer horror.”

The scene was later contained and those injured were rushed to a nearby GP’s office for treatment.

A short time later, ISIS posted on their Facebook page that the derailment was their doing and that they’ll do it again as a long as Western militaries continue to bombard and occupy land in the Middle East.

“Fuck got you fuckheads,” wrote ISIS.

“Fucking got you good. Hope you like floor sushi you stupid Betoota fucks. Gronks,”

“Stop bombing us and we’ll stop derailing sushi trains.”

Entire Friendship Circle Treads Lightly Around Their Mate With The Screenshot Archive

Leah Cummins is just another mid-twenties Australian with a close group of girlfriends that still catch up twice a week, eight years after school.

Like many other millennials, Leah learnt early in life that she was never going to own a home in the same place she grew up, and has since prioritised material goods over any form of long-term life plan.

However, it is because of her ability to keep up with all forms of technology and software that has rendered the 26-year-old property manager powerful beyond measure.

Leah has, on her iPhone and backed up on her hard drive, a screen shot of every dodgy conversation she’s ever been a party to. That, as well as incriminating pictures, dating back to the Myspace era.

“Leah is the one that could ruin your life with just a bit of scrolling” says close friend, Bella.

“Someone would call it an unfortunate character trait that she screenshots and archives every bitchy comment anyone ever says about anyone else”

“But by this stage, it’s just assumed that everything we say or do in front of her will come back to haunt us”

“She’s still like one of my best friends”

Both her employers, friends and lovers are aware of Leah’s artillery – and all work to avoiding any tiffs with her because of this.

Leah’s boss Greg says that she has a job for life after he invited her over for a nightcap during a work trip to Adelaide two years ago. Even though the offer was declined, he knew it would never be forgotten.

“I guess it’s a good thing in a way, if I ever want to sack someone else, I’m sure she’ll have an incriminating photo or screenshot I could use”

Leah says it’s such bullshit that she has a reputation for screenshotting everything and who said that.

Father grounds his 13-year-old after discovering he smokes menthols

TEXT:

The father of a local teenager has made the heartbreaking decision to ground his eldest child this afternoon after making a shocking discovery that he smokes menthol cigarettes.

In a statement read by a family spokesman, Walter Cleary said that he didn’t make the decision lightly and that he hopes he can move past the ordeal one day.

“It’s with a heavy heart that we must confirm that my eldest child, Eli, was found early this morning in possession of menthol cigarettes,” wrote Cleary.

“We are working through this as a family and we ask that our privacy be respected at this time. Eli is currently receiving counselling and his mother is expected to fully recover but it’s early days at this stage,”

“Initial investigations are pointing to Eli wanted to get fresher breath for the girlfriend and to possibly improve his spotty complexion, however, we don’t know this for certain.”

Police and investigators were quick to shoot down speculation that the 13-year-old made the switch to healthier cigarettes in the hopes of making his high school cross country team, telling The Advocate that there’s no indication that Eli was afraid of playing a contact sport.

Nonetheless, one curious aspect of the tragedy that the authorities refused to rule out was that Eli only managed to get 8.4 in a school beep test last week, which may have put him on a collision course with the lesser durry.

“Anyone who gets a score of less than 10 in the beep test either has man boobs or no ticker,” said Detective Murray Bedbumper.

“We can confirm that Eli received a beep test result last week somewhere around the mid-to-low eights, despite having enough ticker to play rugby league football and not having man boobs,”

“It is a compelling case. Perhaps he wanted to get back in the 12’s where he belongs, we don’t know at this stage. But improving his cardiovascular health is the biggest lead we have at the moment.”

Local woman’s 10-year school reunion ruined by seeing people she’s avoided for 10 years

TEXT:

Like most well-adjusted regional high school graduates, Emma Caldwell left Betoota for the coast just weeks after receiving her high school results – which were sufficient enough for the now 27-year-old to enrol in a sandstone university.

Fast-forward ten tumultuous years and the junior architect was back in town for the much-anticipated St Glenda’s High School ten year reunion last night in function room 2 at the Betoota Dolphins Leagues Club.

While she looks back fondly on her time at Glenda’s, she both relished in the opportunity to catch up with old friends and recoiled in disgust at having to talk to some of these people again.

“I’ve actively avoided 90% of my high school graduating class,” said Emma.

“Not because I don’t like them anymore but because I never liked them in the first place. Just because ten years have passed, now that we’re all independent adults now, doesn’t mean things have changed,”

“Everyone who didn’t leave this hell hole of a country town is either married, pregnant or on ice. It’s depressing to come back here. I’m sorry but it’s true. Also, most of my classmates were and still are fuckheads.”

Rather than shake it off like she would at any reputable West End wine bar, Caldwell let the presence of her former classmates ruin her evening, telling The Advocate that an interaction with an old friend turned handsy creepo from peer support led her to enjoy her first cigarette in five years.

“I just had to find an out,” she said.

“The only reason why I came back was that I knew that I’d be more succesful than most of the no-hopers I saw last night.”

Part of Italian waiter dies each time a customer mangles pronunciation of Spaghetti Marinara

In particular, the way in which the Betootanese middle-class say, ‘Spaghetti Marinara.’

“It is almost like they are doing it on purpose, just to annoy me,” said Cenzo Totti, a 24-year-old waiter at the Old City district’s oldest Italian restaurant, Mangiare la Figa.

“To say ‘Spaghetti Marinara’ is not difficult, even for the most basic of Italian speakers. But they just do not even try, they just say it so bad.”

While most visiting Italians would simply shrug off a portly retiree ploughing through his native language like a Volkswagen through a peloton of Sunday morning cyclists, Totti feels it’s important to at least try to say a menu item properly – explaining that it’s all part of the dining experience.

“A part of me dies each time some plump entitled white man disrespects my language like that. I’m trying to speak English, in fact, I have to. Motherfucker at least try to speak mine.”

At the breakfast table of his host’s house, 8-year-old Chris kept his head low while his mate’s mum let out a level-10-mum-yell.

“WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?!” screamed Willie’s mum, Karen.

“WHAT DID I JUST HEAR?!”

Willie, who is now dealing with both the wrath of his mother and the embarrassment of being disciplined in front of a friend, does his best to act like he uses those words all the time and his mum is just acting strict.

“Muuuum” he mouths to his fuming parent, while nodding to Chris.

“DON’T WORRY ABOUT CHRIS!” yells his mum.

“YOU SAID IT NOT HIM! WAIT UNTIL YOUR FATHER GETS HOME!”

“THERE WILL BE NO MORE PLAYSTATION THIS WEEK!”

As Willie decides he’s had enough and will no longer be spoken to this way, he tells his mother that he hates her and hates this family before running to his room and slamming the door.

A furious Karen does her best to smile and tells Chris he is more than welcome to play on the Playstation while Willie cries hysterically in his bedroom.

Office Pretends To Get Excited About Visit From Boss’s Little Snot-Nosed Shit Of A Kid

TEXT:

Even though nobody else is allowed to bring their kids into the office out of convenience, every staff member at a local Betoota business is pretending that having their boss’s child at work is a highlight of their day.

With a snot-nosed little fuck marching through the workplace corridors, an entire salesroom at the local skip bin rentals are currently awwwwing and ohhhing like they have just witnessed a baby lamb stand up for the first time.

Kay McGrath has been general manager at the company’s head office for over five years now, and her 3-year-old son has been coming in for ‘afternoon visits’ since he was old enough to open his eyes.

Shelley from accounts says that while she understands the workload his mum is carrying, she doesn’t sympathize with her enough to forgive her for making the entire office play the role of spot-parents while she has a coffee downstairs.

“I’ve got three kids at home with a husband in the mines. I think she would be able to manage without bringing that little shit in here”

However, a 19-year-old temp by the name of Nick says the kid is so cool and he just loves his job.

“I love having him around. He’s so funny”

“The way he yells quotes from Pepper Pig at me and pulls stuff off the table [laughter] he’s such a rascal”

Kay says she’s sorry but she couldn’t find a babysitter so Jordie will be floating around most afternoons this week. You won’t even notice him.

Triple M Apologise For Not Reaching Daily Quota Of Eight P!NK Songs During Drive Show

TEXT:

Local Betoota radio announcer Robert ‘Flash’ Flaczynski has today apologised to listeners for an unprecedented twenty minute gap between P!NK songs.

Flash, who came to fame as part of the wildly popular radio show ‘Flash and Fatso’ in the late 1990s says he hopes he doesn’t get the sack for this – and says that while the ratings don’t give much away – his new slot on drive has been getting great reviews.

“I don’t know what came over me. I really dropped the ball” he told our reporters.

“It’s almost has bad as turning your microphone off during the traffic report. P!NK is an integral part of the Australian radio medium”

While Flash says that this might be a result of him being cognitively depleted due to the ongoing court case he as been embroiled in over comments he made during Mardi Gras this year, it doesn’t explain the fact that he played less than eight P!NK songs over the entire hour.

It is believed the offices of the Betoota Austereo syndication TRIPLE M ‘Desert Rock FM’ have received hundreds of phone calls and emails throughout the afternoon. Their general manager and former late night host, Greg ‘Fisho’ Fisher was unavailable for comment.

Man buys Koala mattress just to get their ads out of his f–king newsfeed

TEXT:

A local marginally-employed-millennial finally caved into mattress giant Koala this afternoon after being bombarded non-stop with their Facebook advertising and purchased one of their reasonably-priced products in the hopes that the assault will stop.

Glenn Cole, a glassie and barback at the Betoota Dolphins Leagues Club, told The Advocate that every single fucking time he scrolls through his Facebook, he sees an ad for fucking Koala and their fucking mattresses.

“Mate, it was either give up Facebook or buy a mattress. I couldn’t see any other way out of it,” said the 23-year-old.

“So I just thought, fuck it, I haven’t treated myself to anything this year. So I might as well get a fucking Koala mattress, seeing as though God and Mark Zuckerberg seem to think I need one,”

“A day later, I’m even further in credit card debt and I’m still seeing the ads. Why?”

The Advocate sought to answer that question for the financially-illiterate Libra and contacted Facebook for comment.

Moments after that request was lodged, our reporters received a prompt and professional reply.

“Please tell Mr Cole that you can hide ads that you find annoying or irrelevant,” said the US tech conglomerate.

“Also, buying a product doesn’t make the advertisements for that product magically disappear. Honestly, it’s common sense. However, we wish him all the best with his new purchase and for using Facebook to connect with the world.”

‘My Shout’ Jokes Office Funny Guy At Work EOFY Party With Unlimited Bar Tab

Even though literally every single person at the pub is aware that the boss has put his card over the bar for the End Of Financial Year party, one local legend is pretending like he didn’t.

The Lord Betoota Hotel is today hosting a local poster printing company – who appear to be really ‘taking advantage’ of the free drinks – before inevitably driving home under the limit to their homes in the city’s fringe.

After noticing that, like him, his colleagues were nearing the end of their drinks – Bob McClymont said he was going to ‘buy a round’.

“Anyone need a drink?” he explodes with.

“They are on me ha ha!”

With his coworkers not immediately across his extremely bad joke, one even makes the effort to tell him that he doesn’t need to pay for anything because there is a bar tab.

“I know. I was just taking the piss” he says cheekishly.

“Of course I’m not paying. These ones are on the boss [laughter]”

The group of people at the centre of Bob’s painfully jovial shit talking respond with an overanimated roar of laughter.

“[laughter] Yeah. Get us a couple” says Gary.

“Yeah. And a bag of coke” too says Sal, who always takes it to far

Bob chuckles.

Hungover Waiter’s Frustrations Become Audible After Fourth Request To Change Order

A Betoota waiter and local party legend Jason Ivy was reported to have made a
considered attempt to hide his disgust and frustration as a table of four, sitting
outside on a busy Sunday morning at their local cafe called to him for the third time
to change their order.

“Can we just change one of those coffees, darrrrrrrrrling” asks a white haired baby boomer who probably works as an art dealer.

“Oh and the beans. Oh Janice you need to try the beans. Darling can we replace all of the eggs with beans. Actually maybe half eggs half beans. So probably make the eggs scrambled? But can you do that without milk?

As Jason’s serotonin levels hit an all time low and the taste of vomit lingered in his
mouth, he did his best to smile and try to relive the mad times he was having just
hours earlier at his mate’s warehouse party but a few streets down the road.

‘So now we’re having two soy chais, a strong short black and a ristretto? Hope

calculated how long he had before he could nip out the back for a rollie and a quick

Townie Drinking On The Bus Confirms The Water In Her Water Bottle Is Vodka

TEXT:

After first telling our reporter what in the fuck he was looking at, Shyarnnah Kelso then instructed him to take a picture – because it’d last longer.

However, after she calmed down a bit, the 19-year-old was able to confirm that her initial outburst was nothing personal.

It was because her label-less water bottle is full of vodka.

“I’m going to Misty Mahjong’s party on Clarke Street and Mum hid her car keys,” she said when asked why she was drinking alcohol on the bus.

“And I’m runnin’ late. I had two potato scallops from the Ship to Shore, now I’m going to get fucked up.”

“It’d invite you along but you look like a bit of a poon.”

Ms Kelso alighted shortly after but not before a brief verbal altercation with the bus driver, who was well aware of her ruse.

She was quick to remind the driver that her family has been in Betoota for ‘a hunnid [sic] fucking years’ and if her brother wasn’t in prison, he’d put a rock through the windscreen.

Police were called sometime later. No arrests were made but police are continuing with their inquiries.

Baby Boomer couple with joint Facebook account have very controversial opinions

TEXT:

After falling in love during their senior year at the exclusive Royal College of Hard Knocks in South Betoota, Leo and Sherryn Slacks knew they’d be together forever.

Enrolling the very next year in the University of Life in nearby Toompine, the couple married just a few months later in the winter of 1971.

“The first place we ever lived in together was this old run-down terrace in the French Quarter,” said Leo.

“It was a bit of a hard pull but we got the $3300 deposit together in under a year by saving and not going overseas all the time. We didn’t eat avocados and never went to the pub,”

“Which is why our kids think we’ve got a pretty poor handle on what the world is like nowadays. They’d have exactly what we had if they’d actually work! Political correctness is responsible for the decay of this country – something we discovered on The Face Book! ”

However, The Advocate reached out to Leo and Sherryn’s eldest son Matthew for comment on his parent’s opinions and what he told our reporters is nothing short of shocking.

The 28-year-old mortgage broker explained that while his parents appear to be pleasant and kind in person, they take on a much more narrow-minded an conservative tone when using their joint Facebook account.

“They leave comments on news articles that are very, very controversial to say the least,” he said.

“Favourite topics for them include gender identity, immigration, gay marriage, religion and other hot button agendas. They’re under the impression that political correctness is ruining the Australian way of life,”

“And that nugget of early onset dementia comes through in their social media activity. I’m not a leftie by any stretch of the imagination, but Jesus Christ, some of the things they write just aren’t fit to print!”

Shock as local Persian rug outlet closes after fire sale as promised

TEXT:

A friendly local rug merchant has broken with tradition and closed his successful outlet store after hosting a fire sale earlier this month in which he declared he was ‘going out of business and everything must go.’

Nathan Haddad’s rug shop, Le Branlette RugWorld, has been a cornerstone and a landmark business in the town’s Lebanese Quarter, situated inside the Old City district of West Betoota, for over 40 years and many locals are sad to see it finally go.

“We didn’t think he’d actually do it, actually close his shop,” said one nearby business owner.

“Persian rug shops are always telling people they’re closing down and all their stock needs to go at outrageous prices. You never think they’ll actually close.”

As for what he plans to do next, Mr Haddad told The Advocate that he plans on taking a well-earned break before returning to start another business venture.

The 54-year-old said he hopes to take advantage of Betoota’s famous six-story bore shed by opening a rooftop cocktail bar not far from his former Old City premises to serve the region’s signature cocktail – the vodka, lime and sea water.

“I will have sea water from all over the world, the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian,” he said.

“Perhaps even water from the Arctic Sea and the Mediterranean for the intrepid drinker who wants something different. It will be great.”

“I will invite you to the opening but don’t bring Clancy because he will make a cunt of himself.”

“What’s wrong with you?”: Man forced to explain why he doesn’t watch Game of Thrones

An overly polite account manager at a local advertising firm has been forced to defend himself this morning after co-workers discovered that he doesn’t watch Game of Thrones, a popular US television series.

Oliver Climt took time out of his busy morning schedule at Lemonger BDDO Betoota, one of the highest-regarded advertising firms in the town’s French Quarter, to speak to The Advocate about how he feels regarding the workplace bullying that stems from his television habits.

“Yeah, but at the same time, nah,” said Oliver.

“Call me crazy but I just can’t get into Game of Thrones. I’ve had housemates, bedmates, people from all walks of life try to spruik the series to me but I just don’t enjoy watching the programme, sorry!”

“Even the books were shit. In my opinion, the best thing that could happen to Game of Throne is the wall of George Martin’s left ventricle blowing out and the series to be cancelled. That’s my opinion.”

The 25-year-old explained that he’d rather curl up on the sofa of a Monday night and watch the smorgasbord of news and current affairs that are broadcast on the ABC.

Combine that with a hearty bowl of pasta with a full-bodied red and you’ve got the bespectacled Virgo’s idea of heaven.

Middle manager asks junior colleague if he’s got ‘Mondayitis’

TEXT:

A popular South Betoota paralegal was bailed up in the corridor of his boutique law firm this morning by one of his bosses, where he was asked why he has a bad case of the Mondays – even Monday.

Dennis Colette, currently undertaking his fifth and hopefully final year of distance Bachelor of Laws study, returned home to the desert capital in the small hours of yesterday morning from the Splendour in the Grass dance party.

“Of course I’ve got Mondayitis,” said the 24-year-old.

“I did some serious living on the weekend. I can barely operate a keyboard now, let alone order a coffee. The check engine light is on in my head right now and all I want to do it eat Easy Mac on the couch and watch highlights of the 1999 cricket and rugby world cups,”

“So yeah Mr boss man, I do have Mondayitis.”

However, while this may be a slow time of year for most law firms in the wider Diamantina Community, Colette is still expected to work diligently on other, less glorious aspects of the legal profession.

His middle manager has assigned him a pile of conveyancing paperwork and tedious amounts of contracts and partnership agreements to mosey over before someone vastly more qualified than him looks over them and publically humiliates them for a mild oversight they may have committed.

“That I can handle,” he said.

“But I just can’t handle Mondays after a weekend in Byron Bay.”

It was reported that while Jenny, the new bassist in Demi and The Undertones did her best

While his girlfriend churned through the unappetising meal, the young engineer couldn’t help but smile to himself.

“I am a clever clever little boy,” he told The Advocate whilst playing some role player game on his Xbox.

After sighing numerous times and scrunching her face while twirling the pasta, Georgia Cameron, couldn’t help but ask her boyfriend how he had managed to butcher such a simple meal so badly.

“How have you burnt Bolognese? I don’t know how anyone could burn Bolognese. You watch MasterChef like three times a week and you can’t cook pasta?” she said.

Tony said he appeared to look hurt by the comments, although quite content with the outcome, with full knowledge that he wouldn’t have to cook for at least a fortnight.

“She’s actually a very good cook. I am actually a pretty good cook to be honest, but now she will cook for the next little while, and if she doesn’t feel like it I’ll hit the jackpot and we will get take away,” he said.

Report finds you’re not pissed until you start talking like they do on The Sims

TEXT:

An independent report commissioned by the Australian Hoteliers Association [AHA] has concluded that patrons should only be denied service due to intoxication when the person starts speaking Simlish, a language invented for the popular video game, The Sims.

The news startled many in the industry, who stand by the traditional definition of an ‘intoxicated person’ which comes with a number of visual and mental indicators.

It’s unclear whether the AHA will adopt the report’s findings as a blanket policy over the industry, but it’s food for thought according to their executive vice president.

“When you come across a patron speaking that hoorang wok-eyed jibberish they speak on that dopey video game, The Sims, you arm bar him out the nearest exit,” said the AHA’s Gary Watson.

“If you can get yourself to the bar without wetting your pants and order a couple drinks then power to you, brother. Hook in and get blind but don’t you start speaking that Simlish. You start speaking Simlish and you’ll be pretzeled until your shoulders dislocate,”

Dangerous Levels Of Impulse Spray Detected At Local SUPRÉ Outlet

TEXT:

It’s still unclear what could be causing the dangerous levels of Impulse Romantic Spark emitting from the change rooms of the North Betoota SUPRÉ outlet.

North Betoota Fire Chief Jason Yabsley said the city’s public works department is currently in discussions with the Aereosal Safety Commission on how to deal with the situation in the prominent Australian fast fashion women’s wear chain

He said the city is looking for a specialized contractor to manage the situation and sterilise the rest of the shop.

“This is a common phenomena, however this individual issue has been left for far too long. There has been little to no air circulation throughout this entire store”

The concern was brought forward Friday evening when the fire department was contacted by the duty officer from the North Betoota Westfield to investigate a report of a very significant radiation reading from the Wendy’s fast food franchise outside the retailer known for fashion items and basics at an affordable price point.

Yabsley said the detection was noticed by a subcontractor who accepts the store has been exposed to thousands upon thousands of popular middle schoolers who are quite liberally in their use of teen-targeted perfume-spray.

“Their detector gave concerning readings of Sweet Smile, Illusions and Tease. The initial readings were very high. At first the reading was 700 rads – 1,000 rads is extremely high and is lethal.”

The Betoota fire department’s Hazmat Team, who are specifically trained to deal with these situations, were dispatched to the scene.

“We went in with detection equipment to get an accurate reading,” Yabsley said, adding gamma radiation was present but at levels that do not pose a significant danger.

The Westfield is currently operating as usual.

Local Account Manager Thinks He’s Indispensable To Multinational Employer

A local suitcuck at Lemonger DOBB’s Betoota office has lashed out at claims made by some of his friends that he honestly ‘doesn’t contribute much’ in the way of revenue and that his position ‘very dispensable’ within the company.

Brett Nicols, a media graduate completely devoid of personality and ambition, was offered the position of account coordinator at Lemonger Betoota after completing a two-week internship at their Melbourne office.

“It was a requirement to complete an internship for us to graduate,” said the 23-year-old chino enthusiast.

“After working diligently for a year, I was promoted to account manager, where I continue to grow, learn and prosper. There’s great room for career growth here at Lemonger and I’m looking forward to many happy years here. I have a great work/life balance,”

“But it’s offensive to me that my friends who work in other industries make fun of me and my job. They say that they could teach a chimp with a near-drowning experience under its belt to do my job. They say I’m completely disposable to Lemonger – that every account manager is dispensable. How rude.” he said.

That’s a personal mantra she’s lived by her whole life and the 66-year-old semi-retired seamstress isn’t about to make any changes.

A native of West Betoota’s infamous Gorden Estate, Corgan says that today’s generation is softer than a microwaved mango and wouldn’t last a second back in the good old days.

“You’re god-damn right I got flogged as a kid. One little bit of cheek we gave to our parents, we were smacked until our bums were raw,” said Sheila, enjoying a naughty inside cigarette.

“And we didn’t have any seatbelts in our cars, either. Teachers could beat you about the ear or give you the cane. Look how we turned out? Just fine thank you very much,”

“Fell off my bike plenty of times, been switched off by the pavement. I’ve even seized a few times from concussion. Nothing. People are made of glass these days.”

Student performs riveting bass cover of Enter Sandman at Year 6 talent quest

TEXT:

An often misunderstood and underappreciated local 12-year-old blew the socks off his peers, teachers and family yesterday afternoon at the Hasbrook Road Public School talent quest.

Jack McElroy, a Libra, spoke candidly to The Advocate about why he chose to stand up there alone with nothing to keep him company except a cheap Yamaha bass guitar and an even cheaper amplifier and why he chose to learn Metallica’s seminal 1991 smash hit, Enter Sandman.

“Because it’s a fucking track, you old grandpa,” said McElroy.

“Metallica is my favourite band and I’ve saved all their albums onto my phone from Spotify. The bass guitar is my favourite instrument, it’s the fucking tits,”

“I tried to get the backing track with all the other instruments so I’d have something to play along to but fuck it, rock’n’roll. Give me a cigarette.”

A number of Jack’s teachers commended him on his performance and they hope it heralds a new direction in his life – one away from the many vices that befall the modern tween in regional areas.

His headmaster, Bernice Roach, said that it’s tough being 12 these days and the added pressures to be ‘cool’ and ‘with it’ are much harder thanks to social media and left-wing politics.

“Jack has had confidence and self-esteem issues for a while,” said Roach.

“But it was heartwarming to see him build the confidence up to perform in front of so many peers and staff. It’s so rewarding as a teacher to help a talented little turtle like Jack emerge from his shell,”

“I’m not much of a metalhead, I’m more of a bottle-of-chardonnay-and-Fleetwood-Mac type of woman, but I’m sure he really nailed it.”

A harmless personal training professional found himself making small talk with another pleasant Betootanese youth as they clip-clopped up the stairs to his third-floor apartment overlooking the Green Park Oval in East Betoota last night around 2am.

Pierre Gynt ran into Isobelle Frogmann, a former workfriend, in the smoking partition of the Betoota Dolphins Leagues Club pokies den just after 9pm last night and the pair got chatting about old times and how much a gronk their old boss was.

One thing led to another and Isobelle found texting her mother from the back of an UberSUV saying that she’d be staying at her friend’s house tonight.

“But when I got to his apartment, which looked like a bomb had gone off in it, he kept trying to seal the team by picking up random things around his room and sharing a short anecdote about it,” she said.

“I mean, dude, I’m already in your bedroom, kinda drunk at a quarter past two in the morning on a Friday night. You’ve already sealed the deal,”

“He got his tennis racquet out from behind his wardrobe and told me he used to play a good standard of the sport when he was in high school. Mate, I don’t care. Stop practising your forehands and put the racquet down.”

However, Pierre’s lack of any tangible self-esteem led him to believe that he still had a lot of ground to cover before things would start getting amoral.

“I have a lot of interesting things in my apartment,” he said.

“Such as this tennis racquet that I used to win the Diamantina Combined High Schools championship. But that was many moons ago,”

“Have I showed you my 1:4 scale model of Pompeii? I haven’t even thought about it for years but look at it while I tell you what I know about it.”

A Birdsville father of four has been flown to Adelaide after he collapsed late last night after learning that his ‘future Wallaby’ is currently seeing a marginally employed Betoota waitress with a septum-piercing.

Morris Davidson, a semi-retired small business owner, was re-watching his favourite episode of Sky News’ Bolt Report when wife Gwendolyn came in with the iPad to show him a few ‘happy snaps’ son Jason had posted to Facebook with his new flame.

Joy and unbridled happiness quickly turned to fear and shame for the 67-year-old as he put his service station glasses on to see that Jason’s live-in girlfriend, Kaspi-Anne Seigh, has a septum piercing.

“He just started groaning and tried to get himself off the sofa to start pacing around the living room,” said Gwendolyn.

“Morry’s speech was slurred and he seemed off balance, then he collapsed down the stairs and started writhing around as if he’d been possessed by Penny Wong or equivalent,”

Dad Gives Giant Telco A Piece Of His Mind By Abusing Overseas Call Centre Operator

A frustrated Brendan Simpson decided to bloody well tell this giant telco what he thinks of it this afternoon, by lashing out at a call centre employee from the Philippines.

After ongoing issues with his internet, the 56-year-old worker in the commerce sector finally picked up the phone to sort it out.

After spending an hour on hold in the queue, the hot-headed Betootan was at boiling point when he finally started speaking to someone.

“Gee whizz that classical hold music with the intermittent “We value your business and thank you for your patience” drives me around the bend,” he said.

However, after a lengthy conversation where he was placed on hold another three times, the telco employee confirmed that there was, in fact, a problem with the line, but it would take 7-14 days to get an engineer out there to fix it.

At that point Brendan lost his mind, unleashing an irrationally vicious spray upon the young man over a host of other issues in his life.

“I just want to stream a fucking episode of the Big Bang Theory on my day off work, and I can’t because of this bloody internet.”

I will be contacting the ombudsman again!” he said.

“I’m not afraid of the bureaucracy involved in taking down these bureaucrats!”

Report: Is There Something Wrong With Your Eyes, Fuck Ya?

TEXT:

Local families at the Betoota Arboretum and Recreational Reserve witnessed a minor verbal altercation today, as one of the young Adams boys decided to throw his weight around in front of his mates.

Tyce Adams, a 13-year-old Betoota High School student decided to verbally abuse a slightly older skateboarders after he caught him looking generally in his direction at the half pipe.

“What the fuck are you looking at c–t?” he barked at the fellow outdoor enthusiasts.

While drinking a cocktail of taurine, caffiene, guarana and 100 teaspoons, Tyce was reportedly feeling extra confident in front of his peers when he decided to ask one of their older boys if there was something wrong with his eyes.

“Want me to get my brothers down here? They’ll fuck you you up”

Sam Phillips, a 19-year-old old commerce student at the University of Western Queensland, says he was throwing a frisbee to his nephew when he was threatened by Adams.

“He’s no different to his old man…”

“…Or his dero brothers. The moment that little prick turns 18 I’ll make sure he gets a hiding down at the Commercial”

Adams told the Advocate today that if push came to shove he would easily have knocked out the the school-leaver.

“Deadset brah, if he kept staring at me I would have, aye. “

“I don’t give a shit. Neither do the boys”

The interview was cut short by Tyce taking an extremely loud phone call to someone on the other side of the park who was trying to find out where he was in the park.

Dolphins 4th Grade Captain Flees Australia With Club’s Rego Money

TEXT:

EXCLUSIVE

The Australian Federal Police have tracked down disgraced former Dolphins 4th-grade captain and club treasurer Lewis Karnava to the remote Greek island of Icaria, where it’s understood he’s been laying low in the wake of allegations that he stole from local rugby league club.

In particular, the club’s rego money.

Each player with the club is required to register with the rugby league authority and the fee payable goes toward insurance, groundskeeping, referee costs as well as the uniform and kit.

“It’s about $260 each for the senior men’s and about a hundred bucks less for the kids and the girls,” said Dolphins President Alf Carton.

“All up, we think Lewis has taken off with close to $12000. We understand he’s in Greece with family but that’s all we know at this stage. The AFP and Interpol are hot on his tail, though,”

“It’s going to be one hell of a kangaroo court hearing when he gets back. He’s going to get the pizzling of a lifetime he is.”

Exactly where on the island the flyhalf-turned-fugitive is a mystery, but the effort to local him has been hampered by a lack of enthusiasm from the local authorities.

Sam Prospera from the island’s police department revealed to The Advocate that finding Karnava is quite low on his policing totem pole for now.

“Ah it’s the middle of summer, let him be,” said Prospera.

“When he runs out of money in the winter, he will surface.”

Local Woman’s Diet On Hold Until Hangover Goes Away

TEXT:

After discovering a debilitating gluten allergy at age 27, Keight McGrath’s world was turned upside down.

Since that horrible afternoon last April, she’s kept to a strict vegetarian diet and drastically reduced her alcohol intake.

However, one of her many vices is the explosive action and entertainment that one can only draw from the wellspring of rugby league football.

Telling herself yesterday morning that she’d take it easy at the post-work Origin drinks party her boutique North Betoota marketing agency was throwing last night, the 28-year-old didn’t stick to her word.

“I had enough rosé to put Rosie O’Donnell to bed,” said Ms McGrath.

“In every since of the word, by the time I got home, I was absolutely legless. My parents were mortified at the state of me. It is what it is.”

Throwing her morals to the wind over lunch, Keight paid a well-overdue visit to her local McDonalds family restaurant where she took the healthy option of ordering a Diet Coke with her Quarter Pounder meal.

“I had to make sure that nobody from work saw me,” she said.

“But I’m just so fucking dusty today, shit I’m sick. I needed some red meat and some hot chips. Who am I kidding? My eyes feel like they’ve had sand thrown in them.”

When asked if she’d continue lying to herself and remain a vegetarian, the saucy Sagittarius said yes she would.

“This is just a one off. I’ll be back on the rabbit food train tomorrow.”

Bloke who just sent photo of his first schooner to group chat not going to make it to kick off

TEXT:

After being asked to not wear his limited edition ‘Senorita’ Justin Timberlake trilby and to wait until the boys and girls arrived at the pub to start drinking, a popular North Betoota used car dealer took a photo of his first schooner of the afternoon and sent it to the group chat.

“Cheers, borrs! [sic]” wrote Chris Matthews to the WhatsApp group he shares with eleven other like-minded and directionless 20-somethings.

“Chris, I thought we told you to wait for everyone to get there,” said a concerned friend, who’s seen the 29-year-old credit card fraudster at his absolute worse.

His absolute worst being at last year’s AFL grand final, where the same group of eleven young men assembled at the nearby Glen Betoota Bowling Club for a low-key afternoon of lawn bowls, cheap nachos and enough cleanskin beer to put Alex Lloyd to sleep.

Shortly after three-quarter-time, Chris was found unconscious on the floor of the unisex toilets beside the pokie room. It’s alleged by police that he was ‘viciously assaulted’ by another patron for pulling the top off a sanitary pin in the toilet stall he was using before dumping the contents over the stall divider and on onto a man the next cubical over.

“That was a bad night,” said a group chat friend.

“Which is why we like to keep an eye on Chris while he’s on the piss. He’s a fucking menace man,”

“Anyway, go you Queenslanders.”

Old Bloke At RSL Looks Like He’s Trying To Blend In With The Carpet In That Shirt

TEXT:

A local patron at the front bar of the Betoota Returned Serviceman’s League could lie down on the floor and be completely invisible, it has been confirmed.

With a shirt that could blind ya, the retired postman by the name of Rex Zammit (68) has created a bit of a name for himself over the years as a vibrant regular with stories as colourful as his lid.

No one in town knows where or how Rex manages to get his hands on such tropical clothing, especially seeing as though he hasn’t been seen anywhere outside of the RSL in the last decade.

However, bar staff and managers say that they feel the twenty-year member of the BRSLC may be wearing these patterns for the same reasons the club has them on the carpets.

“You can’t see half the stains if you have a tropical Hawaiin-style pattern” says club President, Brucey.

“The same way train seats have those colourful kaleidoscope cotton covers – you can hardly see that someone has pissed themselves on it”

While the jury remains locked over whether or not Rex literally pisses himself while on the premises, he certainly does make the other drunken old codgers piss themselves.

“What do ya know?” he asks the younger patrons at the bar.

“Not much, Rex. What do you know” responds local plumbing apprentice Rex.

“I know you’re not getting a beer before me [hysterical smokers laugh]”

Local Dad Claims He Would’ve Smashed The Ninja Warrior Course Back In His Day

TEXT:

A local father-of-four-and-former-warrior slumped back into his couch last night and lit up some lung candy, stared pensively into his OLED television and turned to his family to proclaim that even he, a chinless refrigeration magnate, could’ve smashed the Ninja Warrior obstacle course back in his day.

By his day, Glenn McNally means the summer on 1974.

“I was a bit of a weapon back then,” explained the 69-year-old.

“Look at these ‘roided up handbags doing the jungle gym while all these other worthless sacks of 9-day old hummus in the stands chap and cheer them on. Back in my day, we just would’ve done it. Then had a few loud schoons [schooners] with the fellas afterwards, assaulted some hippie, eaten a big gluten-heavy meal on the couch watching Countdown before 135 seconds of missionary and no eye contact,”

“I’d eaten these show ponies in two seconds flat. I was a fucking AN-I-MAL back in the day.”

However, Glenn’s wife was quick to point out that an apparent ‘back injury’ and ‘flat feet’ that kept him out of the Vietnam War draft would’ve also ruled him out of doing nearly everything on the Ninja Warrior course.

Wanda McNally also alluded to the fact that the two man-boobed teens sprawled out on the living room floor playing Tekken 4 were benefactors of Glenn’s unsinkable genetic code.

“Glenn and the boys hoover a box of frozen oriental-themed hors d’oeuvre each night before tea,” she said.

“And sometimes tea is just more out-of-the-box hors d’oeuvres. They’re all whiter than John Candy’s left arse cheek and none of them could run out of sight on a dark night. Ever. Don’t listen to a word he says. But he’s a good provider and makes me laugh, so I’m indifferent.”

Handsome Local Greek Suffering Severe Injuries To Cheeks After Visiting Grandmother

TEXT:

A local Greek man is in a stable condition after suffering severe lacerations to his cheeks, following a late lunch with his yiayia and her friends at a nearby Helenic cafe this afternoon.

30-year-old Adam Xiannikis was found unconscious in the carpark of a local inner-city shopping centre with both his cheeks bruised and bleeding, after being told how handsome he was by his grandmother and other elderly relatives all afternoon.

While in a stable condition at the local Betoota Royal, Adam says his injuries were sustained around about the same time his yiayia demanded that he bring home a lovely Greek girl for her to meet one of these days.

“Why you not settle down?” she asked while grabbing at his face, in a loving but distressed tone.

“Why you always out drinking with your cousins. You need a good Greek girl. You so handsome”

It is believed that the victim was able to make it as far as the carpark before fainting due to blood rushing to the front of his face, following nearly an hour of having elderly Greek women pinching his cheeks.

“Their hands were like vice grips” he says.

“They nearly tore my face off”

“One of them slapped me I think”

Mr Xiannikis says he will not be pressing charges against his yaiyai or her accomplices, but will be taking into account her pleas for him to make use of his youthful good looks before he turns out like his fat older cousins, who are apparently ‘no good’.

Speaking candidly to The Advocate over his fourth coffee of the day, Dennis Coleman said that the highlights of his days recently is to scroll through his many social media feeds to see what part of Europe his friends are enjoying now.

It’s no skin off the 28-year-old’s nose, as he’s just happy knowing that his friends are having a great time on their holiday while he gets sneezed on riding the bus to work each morning.

“Oh wow,” he said.

“Look, Fred and Julie have just arrived in Corsica! I’ve always wanted to go to Corsica. Over the weekend, I noticed they were in Cannes, which is also a nice place. I am happy for them,”

“But what really blows me away is their steadfast dedication to keeping the content up. They most post six or seven times a day between them – and that’s just on Instagram. There’s the Snapchats, the group chats and the Facebook and so on. It’d be a hard gig taking all those photos.”

However, some of the under-employed software designers friends have been quick to question whether Dennis is actually happy that his friends are overseas and he’s getting sneezed on my people on the bus.

Workmate Alistair revealed to The Advocate that behind closed doors, Mr Coleman hasn’t been speaking so positively about how the happiness he’s drawing vicariously through his friends.

“Nah, Dennis is well off it,” said Alistair, who’s watched Dennis stare out the window of their ground floor office in Betoota’s un-exclusive Brentwood Business Park.

“He’s blowing up, saying that he can’t fucking believe how much their posting and everything. I thought he was going to put his phone through the wall. Every morning, he comes in and says that some wookatook fuck on the bus coughed on him and that he’s going to start carrying a paring knife on the bus so he can stab the next person in the diaphragm who even looks at him,”

“I think Dennis needs a holiday.”

Betoota Dolphins Leagues Club preorder commemorative ‘Dolphin pingas’ for Mad Monday celebrations

TEXT:

With only two regular season rounds left to play, the Betoota Dolphins are hot favourites to take home the Collett Cup wooden spoon after specularly winning last year’s premiership with a stunning last-minute field goal. 

That means that a Mad Monday celebration is just around the corner.

Though the season kicked off earlier this year after a number of complaints stemming from the ungodly September heatwave experienced last season, the quality of explosive bush league football has been top tier according to many competition insiders.

However, the dampen the blow felt by the wider Betoota community due to the wooden spoon inevitability, the Betoota Dolphins Leagues Club has announced they’ve placed an order with a local bikie gang to flood the district with special commemorative Dolphin-shaped ecstasy tablets.

“Nothing says rugby league like a good, old-fashioned, novelty-pressed ecstasy tablet,” said Dolphins chairman Wallace Crumlow.

“So with the help of a fringe criminal organisation, we’ve put in a big order for these dolphin pingas – which will be available over the counter at local chemists and bars from Monday week,”

“Now the only thing left is to try to work out how you spell the noise Dolphins make. That has been a local head-scratcher for generations. I think it’s, ‘eEeEeEeEeEeEeEeEeE’, but I could be wrong.”

The tablets are scheduled to arrive at the Leagues Club late next week.

After 18 months of marriage, the 40-something landscape designer has worked quite hard towards ‘chumming up’ to his wife’s kids from a previous marriage. His efforts, so far, have gone either unacknowledged or unappreciated by her three sons.

With a name like Gary, the stepdad also hasn’t lived down the time he raised his voice to his oldest stepson, Teddy, after he was being rude to their mother several months back.

Along with the lame leather jacket, Gary also seemed to have some sort of styling product in his hair as well – which both Teddy, Brodie and Jack think is also fucking lame.

After referring to the second oldest as ‘champ’ and forcing him to hang out with his own loser kids, a Sunday barbeque is just not that fun because their dad isn’t here and this loser is nowhere near as cool as he is.

“Hey! Do you guys still support The Southside Rabbitohs!?” asks Gary, before presenting a Steeden football for the fellas to kick around the park”

Local Student Confirms That A Bomb Did In Fact Go Off In Her Room

TEXT:

A Daroo Street Polytechnic design student has shared her harrowing tale of how after being asked if a bomb had gone off in her messy Caldwell Street bedroom, she had to confirm that an explosive device did go off, making her room resemble a Mosul farmers market.

Maggie Wonderlup, 21, confided in The Advocate a short moment ago and explained that bombs often go off in her room and that she tries her best to keep her room tidy – especially when her parents visit.

“Yes,” she said.

“I can confirm that at approximately 8pm last night, an improvised explosive device did go off in my bedroom,”

“Some of my friends and family think it’s funny to ask me if a bomb had gone off in my room on the count of it being so messy and all, but the sad reality is that an explosion really did take place.”

While Ms Wonderlup and two unnamed friends were preparing for a night out in her room last night, the actual blast itself did not occur until some time after they’d left.

Police and investigators understand that the Perth-native and her pals frequented The Pelican & Lapband Inn on Lewis Avenue before being asked to leave in what Wonderlup is calling a ‘misunderstanding’.

“We basically all blacked out after that. My netbank says we went to the Dolphins Club but I don’t remember. But yeah the room was a mess when I woke up this morning.”

Queenslanders Somehow Okay With Paying For A Steak That They Have To Cook

TEXT:

Queensland has today revealed that when beer and red meat is involved, just about anything seems like a good idea.

With the late 2000’s trend of cook-your-own steak pubs showing no sign of becoming a tired novelty, local venue operators are revealing just how much money they’ve made from this bizarre challenge of manhood.

“We’ve had people coming here and paying us $30 to cook their own steak for ten years” says the publican of Betoota’s Lord Kidman Hotel, Michael Seymour.

“We don’t really need to pay for a chef anymore”

“I just get the glassies to wheel out a salad bar and these morons spend half an hour pretending to be experts at ‘sealing in the juices'”

“As for for the mark up. They are paying more than most people would to have some Nepalese bloke in the kitchen cook it properly”

“Most of these steaks are either overdone or underdone, but we are still getting paid a 290% margin [laughter]”

It is believed that venues around Betoota are contemplating other similar new gimmicks to cut costs, like cook-your-own-steak-and-wash-your-own-plate-afterwards night or get-your-RSA-and-pour-yourself-a-beer night.

Broke local farmer prays for rain in his year-old John Deere header

TEXT:

A south-west Betoota farmer thought the biggest hurdle he’d have to jump over this year was tossing up between using his new disc seeder to put his wheat in or drag the chisel plough over it then direct drill it like he’s always done.

“It was a matter of how much residual moisture there was in the soil,” said local farmer Michael Cleary, 61.

“But I had a brand-new disc seeder just sitting in the shed but the ground was a bit too hard for my liking when I was ready to sow, but then we got 110 points one afternoon so I thought, ‘Fuck it,’ and I used the disc seeder to put my wheat in with a bit of mono-ammonium phosphate to kick it in the guts,”

“It was a gamble, I wasn’t 100% on the seed bed you get from those soft-country disc seeders and whatnot but we’ll see how it goes. Now all I need is a bit of rain.” he said.

Taking our reporter on a tour around his vast quarter-million-acre spread on the edge of the Simpson Desert, just a short drive to the village community of Haddon Corner, Mr Cleary explained that most of the country he sows crop in is amongst some of the most fertile in the wider Diamantina area.

However, he explained that it’s not enough and that he often retires to the cab of his John Deere S670 after dinner and takes time praying to each major God and asks for a gentle deluge.

“The wheat paddock is a bit poor at the moment and I’ve pretty much sowed into the side of a sand hill, but I’ve estimated the crop would go close to six tonnes a hectare if we get a bit of rain on it now,” he said.

“I’ve had a big punt this winter and I hope there’s something to strip come summer time. I’ve got two million dollars worth of green machinery in the shed that the bank owns, which means I’m broke. The trip to Noosa might be off this summer.”

A sales executive from a niche East Betoota tech start-up broke down late yesterday afternoon and confided in The Advocate in the smoking pokies at the Betoota Dolphins Leagues Club and said he didn’t know if his boss would ever be satisfied with his job performance.

Jack Carter, 23, sells e-commerce software that tracks purchases and traffic and other technical things of that flavour, to internet retailers and consumers alike.

Though he’s currently on a paltry base salary, some of the commissions he made this year have been quite healthy for his bank account – and his employer’s bottom line.

However, his boss has said that there’s always room for the forlorn Libra to grow.

“I just want my boss to come in and say, ‘Mate, I think you’ve sold enough this month. How about you go and lie down in the park this afternoon?’ or something like that,” he said.

“But no, I land a huge client, bring like $100k in business through the company and all he says is something condescending like a ‘cheers mate’ or a ‘good on ya champ.’ What a fucking fuckhead,”

“Sometimes I just want my life to be validated by someone other than my parents.”

Mr Carter then brought his emotions under control and apologised for lashing out so publically.

Shortly before our reporter was asked to leave the premises by security, Carter put a pink lady through More Chilli, did a $5 bomb and hit the feature.

A North Betoota NEET [Not in Education, Employment, or Training] has taken the time out of his busy Tuesday afternoon to take to Facebook to share his feelings about his own life and the almost unavoidable death we all face at the hands of North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un.

While he reserves most of his hatred for those who don’t consider shoegaze its own standalone genre, Morris Curnow turned his laser of unabridged vitriol in on himself.

“Sometimes I don’t even know why I bother even trying,” he wrote.

“Now that Kim Jong-un now has the means to turn us all into radioactive dust, I don’t have to look for a job. I mean, my fucking parents don’t understand that it’s all pointless and that Bruce Springsteen was wrong,”

“He used to say, ‘Nobody wins, unless everybody wins,’ before he’d jump into live versions of Born to Run. What a fucking gronk. He hasn’t got shit on Neil Halstead or Kevin Shields. Anyway, I welcome our impending death at the hands of old Kim Jong-Loveless.”

REPORT: 9 in 10 MagicBullets™ are sold between 2am and 4am to half-pissed men

TEXT:

A groundbreaking report into the television shopping industry has uncovered some shocking and disturbing figures – one of them being that 90% of MagicBullet™ blenders are sold to marginally employed men between the ages of 20 and 30 between the hours of 2 and 4 in the morning.

Australia’s peak scientific and research body, the CSIRO, revealed their findings at a press conference in the Cooladdi Hotel function room this afternoon. While some were not surprised at the findings, others were taken back by the insights into the $1bn industry.

“If I had to guess,” said one hotel patron.

“I would’ve said that middle-aged women and men would’ve been buying the MagicBullet system. Not these young rough-and-tumble young fellas. That being said, I don’t see too many young blokes hoeing into a smoothie of a morning time around here,”

“Makes a man think, you know?”

The Advocate reached out to an underemployed greenskeeper at the Betoota Links Golf Club, who admitted to owning a MagicBullet, as to how he came to own one and what he currently uses it for.

As a graduate of the exclusive and world-renowned history department at the esteemed Australian Catholic University, South Betoota man Peter Dennis said it’s been hard to find work in the history field, especially in the Channel Country, so he’s been forced to take a job tending to the district’s golf courses and parks.

He purchased a MagicBullet™ blender in April 2011.

“I tried to make a chocolate mousse in it once, but it didn’t work out,” he said.

“What I was left with was a pint of dairy-heavy thick gloop that my housemates estimated to be at close to 13 000  calories. You bet your sweet little ass I drank it down,”

“Then I felt guilty, leading to me put the old Mago-Bullo [sic] in the cupboard where it’s been ever since. I rate it 9 out of 10.”

Many of the blokes travelling over to the Europe confirmed to The Advocate before they left that they’d never actually been overseas before and that they were looking forward to the challenge of adjusting to life in London.

“We’ll be here for a week before heading out bush to play a bit of cricket,” said team captain Lewis Karnish.

After spending the better part of the morning and the worst part of the afternoon crawling through Temple gastropubs and traditional bars, the group made their way down to Walkabout, an institution and rite-of-passage for many a young Australian in London.

Showing their Queensland licences at the door, the team piled into the main bar and immediately spotted a fridge full of Milton Mangoes and a rerun of the Cowboys playing the Roosters back in 2009.

“This place is off the chain,” said wicketkeeper Darryl Beanpole.

“I could fucking live here, mate. Cheap piss, great weather and it’s full of Aussies.”

Local PE Teacher Concerned His Students Aren’t Putting 110% Into Beep Test

TEXT:

All that Robert Illes wants from his students is their personal best – that’s his internal motto and a personal creed that’s served him well so far in life.

But the 24-year-old recent graduate voiced his concerns to The Advocate last night over half a dozen vodka Powerades down at the Betoota Dolphins Leagues Club about the amount of effort his students are putting into his classes.

In particular, the beep test.

“Oi, I know that nobody really likes doing the beep test but I expect my students to at least do their best,” he said.

“Their personal best. I mean look, I don’t wake up each morning and bust my arse and smash a gym session before school or run an easy 5km because somebody is making me do it. I do it for me.”

The South Betoota Technical teacher then went on to explain that there’s a big difference between those who do try and those who don’t.

“It’s a tactical thing as much as it is about cardiovascular endurance,” said Illes.

“Those big dumb jock kids who run as fast as they can straight out of the gates aren’t doing themselves any favours. Just like the kids with a reasonable amount of fitness dropping out at 5. You can’t win.”

Teenage Murri Girl Debuts The Treasured Red, Black And Yellow High-Tops At Local NAIDOC Event

TEXT:

A popular local Murri girl has today gone all out for the town’s National Aboriginal and Islander Day Observance Committee (NADIOC) celebrations at Midhaga Oval in central Betoota.

With her younger cousins in town, Jasmyn Pavlovic (17) is underplaying the fact that she bought this entire outfit solely for this event, as the entire region’s community comes together to celebrate the history, culture and achievements of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples not just in Betoota but Australia-wide.

Dressed in stretch jean leggings, also known as ‘jeggings’ and Aboriginal flag coloured Nike high-tops, Jasmyn has attracted the attention of not only some of the visiting boys from up north, but also family members who have noticed how dolled up she is.

“What’re you talking about, I’m not dressed up!” she yells at her annoying brothers who have accused her of showing off.

“Do you want me to shame you in front of all the girls?” she threatens, in a successful diversion from her flash new look.

NAIDOC Week, as it has been known since  is celebrated not just in the Indigenous communities but also in increasing numbers of government agencies, schools, local councils and workplaces. However for the nation’s Indigenous youth, it is used as a chance to chat up members of the opposite sex, or at least impress them with their deadly new kit.

Alongside the trend of jean leggings and fake finger nails, teenage Murri boys are also known for trotting out their flannelette Dickies t-shirts and Chicago Bulls flat brims – while also ensuring their adolescent moustaches are trimmed neatly.

With roughly 45 extended family members in eyeshot, Jasmyn knows better than getting to close to some of the Bedourie fellas that have come in for the day, but she has ordered her 12-year-old cousin tells them to add her on Facebook.

Man becomes boxing expert over the course of the afternoon

A polite young man has been drifting through the Betoota Hotel this afternoon telling anybody who’ll listen his two cents about what he describes as ‘the biggest fight in Australian history.’

Dennis Collie, a local solicitor and combat sports fan, has told every person in the pub twice that he things Jeff Horn is going to get switched off like a reading lamp this afternoon when he takes on the ageing Filipino powerhouse Manny Pacquiao in Brisbane.

“Oi, just here me out, but,” said the 25-year-old, who’s already been asked to stop fishing through the ashtrays for half-smoked bungas.

“Jeff Horn, mate. I know he’s an Aussie and blah blah blah but Manny is the champ, mate. He’s the champ. I reckon it’ll go six rounds before the umpire stops it, but. Yeah but nah oi can you get us a beer, but? I’m waiting to get paid.”

Halfback Criticised For Wearing Boardies In Shower And Not Letting The Boys See His Cock

TEXT:

Steve Samson hasn’t heard the end of it this week.

The university student who plays Reserve Grade for Marist Brothers Rams in Lismore has drawn the ire of teammates after wearing undies for a post-match shower in the sheds.

“Far out, I am getting absolutely roasted by these blokes. For the first grade game, and the rest of Saturday night I was copping heaps,” the aspiring teacher said.

“I thought that would be the end of it, but Sully and Sticks were berating me again on Tuesday night at training. I really don’t understand what was so weird about it.”

Samson said that he just a quick shower in his jocks before getting changed. 

Club legend Sully, told the Advocate that it’s weird that the second rower wasn’t comfortable in the raw with the rest of the team; “What’s wrong with him? Why is he scared of getting his dick out in front of the boys?  Is he some kind of poof or something?”

Sully confirmed that he will continue you to paste the young fella; “Aha mate it’s all in good fun though. Yeah, it’s weird, but we don’t really care that much. It’s just entertaining to give it to him and watch him clam up.”

Samson addressed what may happen this weekend, and said that he won’t even be showering this week.

“Nah fuck em, I have zero interest in seeing some hairy middle aged blokes walk around in the skint after I have been flogged for 80 minutes. I’m just gonna get changed quickly and get out on the tins.”

Man Unsure If Washing Still Wet Or Just Cold

TEXT:

After a third straight day of drying, Betoota Lakes local Zach Simpson has finally decided to bring his washing in.

After testing his clothes moisture content by touch during the previous two days, the young man can finally confirm that they were just cold, and not in fact wet.

“Hooley dooley, it’s so friggin hard to tell if it’s actually wet, or if the garments are just cold.  Like, you touch them and they feel wet, but they aren’t they are just cold,” the engineer living in share accommodation said.

He made the call after touching three of four pieces and deciding they probably were right to bring in.

Simpson said that because it doesn’t rain much in the channel country over winter you can leave clothes out overnight for quite some time without a worry.

“I almost use it as an extra wardrobe sometimes that is until the house mates give me a spray for leaving my clothes out for ages. Gee that annoys me actually. They are always hassling me about it, ‘Oh Simo you ever gonna bring your clothes,’ like Jesus Christ I moved out of home so I wouldn’t have to be pestered about that sort of shit,” he said.

Young Monarchist ‘not having much luck’ on Tinder after listing it in bio

TEXT:

The president of the local Young Monarchist League in South Betoota had too many Negronis last night at the Betoota Hotel and let slip that after adding his political leanings to his Tinder profile, he hasn’t been getting too many right swipes.

Tom Annise, 23, confided in The Advocate last night telling our reporter that he thought the local ladies would think he was ‘sophisticated’ and ‘traditional’ by being a young monarchist, but his plan to bed astute, classy women via a dating app have seemingly backfired.

“I’m the talk of the town,” said Annise.

“For all the wrong reasons. All the girls think I’m a serious, grade A poon now because I support Australia being a constitutional democracy. I just don’t get it. I might as well advertise that I’ve got genital warts. By gosh, I didn’t even know young people cared so much about a republic.”

The intimacy-deprived Libra’s fears were confirmed by a local girl, Wendy Patchmen, who told The Advocate she audibly snorted when she came across Tom’s profile.

In addition to describing himself as a Young Monarchist, Tom has also clearly stated that he’s a ‘Red wine enthusiast’ and a ‘Labradoodle Daddy’.

This isn’t helping his cause, according to Patchmen.

“I mean, who actually thinks it’s a good idea to write that stuff?” asked Wendy, a sandwich artist at the North Betoota Westfield Subway restaurant.

“He looks harmless enough, which also isn’t helping his cause. Owning a Labradoodle at 23 is also very suspect. But at least it isn’t a cat. Red wine enthusiasts are more often than not enthusiast about other odd shit like state cricket and European soccer. In ten words or less? No thanks.”

BREAKING: Gen-Y Instagrams Photo Of Boyfriend Without Referring To Him As ‘This One’

TEXT:

While celebrating a five-year anniversary with her boyfriend today, Betoota millennial Sophie Kinder, naturally reached for Instagram to acknowledge the momentous occasion. However, what happened next has left Betoota in shock.

It was largely assumed, as is common social media practice, that Sophie would refer to his boyfriend as “this one” – as she had done in previous posts throughout their relationship:

– 6 months with this one, couldn’t be happier!!

– Happy Birthday to this one, can’t wait to celebrate many more with you!!

– Con-grad-ulations to this one!!

– Great night at the Betoota Cricket Club Awards night. Couldn’t be prouder of this one!!

However, in an unprecedented move, Sophie went ahead and thanked her boyfriend for the past five years, by naming him in the post – “Five years with Hugh today”.

Betoota’s social media investigator unit have deemed this “social media suicide”, and point to the decrease in likes for this photo compared to her rolling average as evidence.

While yet to get in contact with Sophie, the unit and the rest of the town wants answers.

This latest incident comes on the back of a busy fortnight for Betoota’s social media unit.

Last week, Belle of Betoota was thanking her boyfriend for their two year anniversary. She failed, however, to thank him for “putting up with me”.

Prior to that, a Sunday session at the Betoota Arms was ruined when three females failed to Boomerang their house whites and cured meats board.

Local Lady Consciously Turns Phone Off For The First Time Since She Got It

TEXT:

A local buyers agent contacted The Advocate this afternoon regarding something she did this morning that she’s sure nobody has done consciously before.

She turned her late model iPhone off on purpose.

Save for the few times she’s let the thing go flat, her phone has never been off since she bought it last October from the Castro Boulevard Telstra shop in Betoota’s historical Latin Quarter.

“Yeah crazy, huh?” remarked Kaytlen Pichot, 23.

“I had like 10 percent left and I had to drive out to Tanbar to look at some flats for an investor, but I knew it wouldn’t last the trip. So guess what? I turned by phone off on purpose because there’s no reception anyway between here and there so yeah, random.”

Ms Pichot said she brought up the topic of turning one’s phone off over lunch today in the office.

Much to her surprise, nobody admitted to doing it – ever.

“My boss spat out part of his Vietnamese pork roll on the carpet he was that shocked,” she said.

“I haven’t had this much blowback on anything since I started wearing my boyfriend’s suits to work so the foreign investors would take me seriously. One of my colleagues said that nobody would buy an off-the-plan apartment from a lady that looked like Ellen DeGeneres’ and Gordon Tallis’ love child.”

Young legal professional makes it home just in time for Lateline

TEXT:

A recent law graduate working at Rodmann Carter Poncho in Betoota’s Old City district has revealed to The Advocate that he often leaves work with just enough time to make it home before Lateline starts at 10:30 pm.

Though the popular late-night news and current affairs programme airs an hour earlier on ABC News 24, Sam Walter-Whitney says arriving back at his south-west Betoota apartment before 9 is almost unheard of.

“The first thing I do when I get home is put party pies and tracksuit pants on. Most nights, I do six with a mixed green salad, but only if I didn’t go to the gym in the morning,” said the 25-year-old.

“But yeah, there’s not a lawyer in the office under 30 that goes home before 8 o’clock. We’ve all got three clients at the moment and all it takes is for one of them to ring up at 4 pm and tell you they’ve got a problem. Then you’re basically there until midnight.”

While Sam freely admits that he doesn’t really get much living done at night, explaining that he usually falls asleep on the couch watching Tony Jones argue with someone with half a glass of wine in front of him and crumbs down his plastic non-iron work shirt, he does try to fill his mornings with something more worthwhile.

However, the assiduous Aires admitted that he only has productive mornings when he doesn’t overdo it on the bargain bin Shiraz the night before.

“That’s most nights,” he said.

“So most mornings, I just wake up five minutes before my alarm and stare at the ceiling, wondering if the five years of university was worth it all. It was, but I can’t wait to be a partner.”

Dad Spices Up Text Message With A Few Pointless Commas

TEXT:

According to a study conducted by Australia’s chief scientific body, the CSIRO, close to 8 in 10 Australians under the age of 25 has received an obscure, barely comprehensible text from a parent.

This afternoon, local student Julie Dalhasse became one of those 8.

The 21-year-old event management second-year revealed to The Advocate that her Luddite father is ‘typically pretty good’ at using a mobile phone – but the string of messages she received this afternoon made her question that.

“I know we’ve got dinner with my aunt tonight, I think that’s what he was talking about,” she said.

“But other than that, he’s lost me.”

The Advocate reached out to her father, Max Dalhasse, a semi-retired cattle grazier for comment and managed to get a hold of him after calling three times.

He told our reporters that he was able to manage quite well with his old Nokia before some ‘uppity pantryboy’ at the Daroo Street Mobile Shak convinced him to upgrade to a touch screen.

“You should see me try to use the hoorang bit of shit,” shouted Max.

“Everything is so fuck-ing small and you bump the thing and everything goes away. Took me 40 minutes to write that out. I’ve got half a mind to put the bastard through the shop window next time I’m in town,”

“But yeah, I was trying to get a hold of my youngest, Julie, to tell her that her aunt can’t make it for dinner at Rosewood’s tonight and that she can call me and I’ll come pick her up,”

“On second thought, I should’ve just called her off the landline.”

Local Kindy Teacher Finally Free Of These Little Bastards For Two Weeks

A popular early childhood teacher at East Betoota Primary School can almost feel the sem sauv blanc run down her throat this afternoon as she counts the hours down until she’s on school holidays.

Dahlia Weilson, 24, is just about half way through her first full year as a full-time teacher and agrees that there’s nothing else she’d rather be doing with her life – but in saying that, she’s thankful for the holiday time.

“I love my class, they’re such darlings but Jesus fucking Christ, I need a break once in a while,” she said.

“The incessant nagging and all the tiny voices asking: ‘Ms Weilson, Ms Weilson’. It can get too much by 3pm. If I was older and sufficiently more jaded, I’d be keeping the whole Diamantina wine region afloat. But yeah, only a couple more hours to go.”

“It’s not like I’ve got anything planned for the holidays, though. I’ve just done reports and I’m running on an oily rag. I reckon the first week I’ll just lie around in my Qantas pyjamas drinking wine and eating Thai. Literally heaven to me right now.”

Teachers are often the target of unfounded criticism from other professionals, who say they have great hours and 12 weeks holiday a year.

But Ms Weilson has thrown the gauntlet down to anyone who thinks they can manage a heard of 5-year-olds while trying to teach them a bit about reading and writing.

“Just try it, for one day, just try it. Then tell me I don’t deserve the holidays I get.”

Melbourne-bound flight delayed after pilot loses the keys

TEXT:

A pilot has been reprimanded by his superiors this afternoon after it’s alleged the 27-year-old left the keys to the airline’s late model Boeing at home.

Stephen Morris, a Connellan Airways employee, was said to have misplaced the keys on the way to the airport and only noticed once he tried to unlock the Boeing 717.

He joined Connellan in 2009 as a cadet at their Remienko International Airport training base in South Betoota.

However, it’s understood that this is the first time he’s been reprimanded for misconduct.

“We can confirm that a Betoota to Melbourne service was delayed this afternoon,” said Connellan CEO Sam Cruikshank.

“It was delayed because one of our pilots left the keys to the aircraft in the Uber he took to the airport. He was able to contact the driver and organise them to be returned to the airport,”

“The delay to passengers was minimal as one of the stewardesses was able to unlock the cabin door with a coat hanger, allowing customers to get comfortable before the keys arrived. Alls well that ends well.”

The Advocate spoke to a number of passengers at the departure gate about the delays.

One passenger remarked that the co-pilot said that they could just get another plane to help them clutch-start the aircraft, but had ‘no way’ or turning on the ignition without the keys.

Another onlooker said the pilot first tried to open the aircraft by throwing a rock through the cabin door window, explaining that he wouldn’t take it over 500 feet the whole way as to not asphyxiate the passengers. It also alleged Morris said he could ‘hot-wire’ the Boeing, but was quickly talked out of that.

Hospo Worker Seeks Revenge For Lost Penalty Wages By Compiling Most Fraudulent Tax Return Yet

TEXT:

An underemployed graduate of the exclusive South Betoota TAFE College has compiled his most fraudulent and dishonest tax return to date this afternoon.

Fergus Blister, a qualified horticulturist, works as a sandwich maker at a nearby cafe during the day and occasionally runs cockfights in his backyard to supplement his meagre income.

However, he failed to declare the income he generates from the latter to the Australian Tax Office.

“The cash I make from cockfights goes undeclared,” said the 27-year-old.

“That money is for me and I use it to buy roosters when the fellas can’t get the fight card put together in time. But yeah, that and the ‘$700 of laundry’ I do and my ‘work phone’ are also a bit how ya going.”

“I’m just getting my own back after the government allowed Penalty Rates to be axed because they never had to work a hospo job in their life and their kids might only need to work in one to ‘learn the value of money,’ not because they need to pay bills”

“So fuck em.”

Mr Blister’s attitude isn’t dissimilar to a number of other young people around town.

The Advocate spoke to a few whining Millennials, who said the cost of living and real estate prices are keeping them from keeping honest.

“You can’t expect a red-blooded Australian to file a perfectly above-board tax return,” said one local hairdressing apprentice.

“It’s unAustralian. The only thing people hate more than the tax man is the bouncer at the Crazy Horse in Adelaide.”

Man Who Chased Dreams Of Playing Professional Football Until 28 Now A Real Estate Agent

A former rugby sensation is starting a new chapter in his life this morning after finally finding his true passion in life.

Michael Priestly, a graduate of East Betoota’s exclusive Cartwright College for Boys, passed his real estate exams last week. The 29-year-old was immediately offered a place at Coleman & Sons Real Estate of Mulholland Avenue.

“I’m just really excited to get started,” he said.

“This is a dream come true. I love working with people and in a rewarding environment. Watch this space!”

The one-time-fly-half of the Cartwright 1st XV is the newest leasing agent on the Coleman team and will take up a challenging post handling the volatile student housing market in the trendy Old City district.

But it’s admittedly not all fun and games for the former high school deity.

He’s had to swallow more than his fair share of humble pie in order to get this job, but he’s committed to making it work.

“It would be an accurate statement to say that I peaked in high school,” he said.

“Since we won the premiership and everything, I haven’t really done much. I went to college in Brisbane on scholarship and did an Arts degree. Then I went surfing for a bit, then tried to start my own surfboard wax business. But I was playing footy the whole time. Ewen McGregor used to come watch me play”

“But I didn’t know the first thing about business so next thing I knew, I was in the hole for $70k – so I had to come home to Betoota and start again. So I sacked up and bought a pot of hair gel and got a BMW on novated lease. Next thing I know, I’m chasing up late rent all morning and avoiding my boss all afternoon. This job is literally perfect for someone like me.”

Local father returns home from Dark Mofo with more questions than answers

After being roped in by his wife and eldest daughter, a West Betoota agronomist ventured down to Tasmania for the ‘Dark Mofo’ festival for a much-needed break.

However, Dennis Beckmann explained to The Advocate this afternoon that he didn’t really feel like he had a break and that he didn’t get much of an opportunity to relax while down in the island state.

“It was actually quite stressful,” said the 63-year-old.

“There were a lot of things I saw down there that I wished I hadn’t. I’m a relatively simple man, I enjoy watching the football and cricket. But I’m not that closed-minded. I’ve voted for the Labor Party before. But yeah, that Dark Mofo is something else,”

“You could say I won’t be going back next year. Too many facial piercings and outstanding HECS loans for my liking.”

But daughter, Meredith, is under the impression that her father enjoyed himself more than he’s letting on.

As too is Dennis’ wife Michelle, who said he actually liked some parts of the show.

“He typically goes on and complains about all these ‘dumb lefties’ wasting time on the arts, but I think he actually kind of likes it a bit,” said Michelle.

“But he’s been really quiet since he got back, maybe watching those people rip a bull apart was a bit too much for his little Sky News mind to take in.”

Local Townie Says He’ll Wrap His Razor Scooter Around Your Head If You Keep Talking Shit

TEXT:

A young townie has taken time out of his busy Saturday afternoon of spitting in public and dropping in down the Watson Road Skate Park to speak to The Advocate about dealing with haters and shit talkers.

“I will wrap this razor scooter around your fucking head if you talk smack,” revealed Lewis Matthews, son of local magistrate Gary Matthews.

“The last fuckhead I beat with my scooter dropped and flopped around at the bottom of the skate bowl like a carp on a river bank while he did his best to unconsciously swallow his tongue,”

“That’s what you get.”

However, Acting Superintendent Michael Rust from Betoota Police said that’s not only the wrong thing to do, it’s also illegal.

Rust is acutely aware of young Mr Matthews and knows his father personally – but that doesn’t detract from the fact that causing bodily harm to another person simply because they’re ‘pissing you off’ is not on.

“I know that young men especially get angry and frustrated from time to time,” said the Acting Superintendent.

“But to hurt someone like Lewis did last month is dangerous and illegal. I don’t understand why townies feel the need to get so violent and nasty. You don’t get this type of horseplay from the farm boys. We just ping them for drink-driving from time to time.”

But Lewis did offer some explanation as to why townies like to beat each other with scooters, trolley poles, wallet chains and skateboards.

The 13-year-old said West Betoota is a dog-eat-dog part of the world and you need to defend yourself and your honour at all times.

“If the police did their job, I wouldn’t have to lash gronks about the head with my wallet chain when they talk shit. Same goes for my scooter. It’s not good for it, but I’m not about to back down as dishonour myself. It’s all about staying loyal to yourself.”

Local Mum still not sure if blast suit is enough to protect her from the Thermomix

An East Betoota mother of three received her branded Thermomix bomb suit in the post earlier this week, but still isn’t game to try making dinner tonight with the Thermomix.

Jenny Cockburn, a former portfolio manager at Macquarie Private Wealth’s Jundah office, spoke to The Advocate a short time ago about her apprehensions about using her trendy all-in-one food maker.

“You see all the negative press about these things. About them popping open and burning people,” said the 49-year-old homemaker.

“I don’t want to be whipping up a curry one minute, then wake up in the hospital a week later looking like a dropped lasagne. Thermomix sent me out a blast suit to wear when I’m cooking, but I still don’t think that’d be enough if it all went pear-shaped,”

“Maybe I’m over-reacting. It’s a fine product and I know they like to sue people who put shit on the Thermomix, so yeah. Food tastes great and all. But you know what they say, big rewards come from big risk.”

The Advocate reached out to Thermomix for comment, but have yet to receive a reply.

However, we did send a journalist undercover to a Thermomix party, where prospective buyers meet with brand consultants and learn how to use the product.

Matthew Mitcham’s Olympic Diving Record Shattered By Local Murri Kid Off The 10 Metre

TEXT:

A local Murri kid has broken Matthew Mitcham’s Australian record for the highest single dive score, after pulling off a octuple backflip at the local public pool this week.

13-year-old Peter Uebergang awed people around the country after Youtube footage emerged of the young fella perfectly executing a never-before-seen aerobatic manoeuvre from the ten metre board at Betoota Artesian Aquatic Centre

Gold-medal-winning Olympic posterboy Matthew Mitcham has confirmed himself that Peter’s dive was nothing short of flawless.

“Yep, it was a perfect 10. I have never seen anything like it. It’s absolutely incredible,” he told the Advocate after watching the footage.

“I can totally understand the Diving Association’s decision and am pleased to hand the mantle over, Pete is a deserving recipient,” he said.

As is commonly acknowledged in small country towns, the official initiation to adulthood for both Indigenous and non-Indigenous townie youth is whether or not they can pull off sick gainers from the ten down at the pool.

Uebergang said he was stoked with the title and can’t believe who many people across the country are watching the video.

The young man, who is also a talented footy player, said that while he was flattered by the attention he can’t understand what the fuss is all about.

“Come down the pool on Friday arvo and you will see me and the boys doing shit like that for hours.”

The ABC has taken the story and run with it, citing it as the perfect example of obscure sports alleviating the third world conditions that Australia’s remote Indigenous population are often subjected to.

Uebergang said he is open to the chance of sporting scholarship down in the big smoke, but hopes no one underestimates that he is also quite good at maths.

“Why doesn’t anyone care about my academics?” he asked.

“Is diving seriously the main reason people want me to finish school?”

Accountant Devoid Of Personality Reveals He’s Training For Local Triathlon

TEXT:

Go to school. Go to university. Get a job and within 20 to 30 years you will achieve success. That’s what Sam Edwards has been told all his life.

Unfortunately, he was never told about how dull and commonplace working a 9-5 office job can be.

After a couple of years of going through the motions, 25-year-old Edwards has decided to take his life into his own hands, and find a more immediate purpose.

The private school graduate has decided that committing to a display of physical exertion is exactly the spark he needs.

“Yeah mate, I will be doing a bit of triathlon up the central coast later this year,” he has begun telling family members, friends and colleagues at Ernst & Young’s South Betoota office.

“It will be incredibly tough, but you know what I am actually pretty excited about,” he said.

Rather than join a local sporting team and engage with other humans regularly, the young self-titled go-getter would rather flog his mediocre body for 2-3 hours on an almost daily basis.

“I have started my training this week, and I can tell you I have already learnt more about myself than I thought I ever would.”

Speaking in a similar vein to a young affluent private school girl with wanderlust, Edwards has already begun telling people about the benefits of committing to something like this.

Chris Constance, a long-time friend told The Advocate that whilst the group respects Sam, the whole thing is a bit of a fucking joke; “Holy Moses, he has spent 2 or 3 grand on gear already. The fact that he has bought an $1800 dollar bike is pretty ludicrous. It’s the epitome of strawberries to the pigs.”

“I wish him all the best; I just don’t really understand why you would inflict pain on yourself 5 or 6 times a week to compete in some C grade competition twice a year. If he want’s pain he should pack a scrum for the local fourth-grade team with a crippling hangover,” said Constance.

“I kicked him out so he’d learn a thing or two about life,” said the 66-year-old.

“But all he’s done is find the cheapest possible room to rent in a nice neighbourhood that he can afford to live in while enjoying a workless lifestyle. I don’t even know how he got it? He’s not disabled, he’s just lazy.”

However, Michael Jnr has lashed out at his father for saying he needs to find a job.

He explained to The Advocate just moments ago that there are no writing jobs going at the moment, which is what he studied to be.

“There’s one thing that my father doesn’t understand,” said Michael Jnr.

“I’m not about to let myself be underappreciated. I have a voice and I think it needs to be heard. I can’t work two jobs, writing is a full-time gig. Because we live in a developed country, I should be able to claim benefits while I write! Even if it doesn’t get published!”

While that hasn’t stopped the 24-year-olds from enjoying a wide circle of like-minded friends and acquaintances, it has prevented them from enjoying the Queen’s Birthday long weekend in the past.

“I mean, it’s just such an archaic and ‘colonial’ holiday to have,” said Prattley.

“We should be celebrating something Australian! Like we could commemorate the shelling of Sydney and Newcastle by the Japanese, which happened on June 8? Just a thought.”

Ms Gooch was equally as critical of the current holiday, however, the Virgo was more optimistic about what we should be celebrating as opposed to the birthday of Queen Victoria, a ‘woman responsible for more human suffering than Mother Teresa.’

“I agree with Wal,” she said.

“We need to change this current system, even if it won’t actually change anything, it’ll just cost the taxpayer millions of dollars,” she said.

“But I think we as a nation should celebrate the birth of  Steve Renouf each year. He born on the 8th and he’s a great Australian. Just a thought.”

Dangers Of Co-Sleeping With Infant Waived Until Mum Gets Cute Instagram Shot

TEXT:

New local dad, Brett Broadus has today graced social media with an adorable photo of him napping alongside his two-month-old daughter, Zara.

Despite the fact that his child has essentially not stopped shitting, crying or eating since they left the hospital in mid-May, friends of the Brett and his wife Mandy are under the impression that things are all good in the Broadus household.

While many paediatric safety experts have for centuries warned against co-sleeping with children under the age of five, it seems the grave dangers faced by Zara napping alongside her 90-kilogram father simply do not weigh up against how cute the photo is.

However, other dads in Brett’s social circle can see right through his vain attempt to look worthy of an infant’s trust.

“There is no way he is asleep” says Tim, Mandy’s best friend from work’s husband.

“What a load of shit. That kid can barely open her eyes yet, let alone sleep long enough for him to catch a few zs”

Close mate and second cousin Jack also refuses to accept the commonly held theory that Brett is able to sleep at the same time as Zara.

“What I went over their to drop off some old baby clothes the other day. That kid didn’t stop making noise for a whole two hours”

“If he is asleep then he is a really bad dad. Imagine if he rolled over?”

Bloke Who Just Drove 100m To Shops Walks Half A K To Avoid ATM Fees

TEXT:

Paul Churton was the butt of jokes again last night, after walking over 500 metres to the closest ATM operated by his Bank.
Early on in the night, Churton refused to use the RediSmart ATM at the pub, which would charge him “a stupid bloody fee,” and decided to go for stroll.
Despite confirming that he drives a few hundred metres down to the local shops on an almost daily basis, Churton stands by his decision.
Much to ire of his friends, the young engineer said that there is “no fucking way I will be coughing up my hard earned, to pay a bank for the use of my money.”
“It’s rubbish mate, the only thing in this world I hate more than architects, is ATM fees. And, I can tell you something, I hate fucking architects,”

“They have all these airy fairy idea’s in their heads, and want engineers like me to make it happen,” he said.

The Advocate had to cut his ramble off after about five minutes, at which point Churton had almost given himself a hernia.

A friend Will McRae confirmed that it is “bullshit that they slog you with those fees every time. But, if I am out having a beer I’m not going to walk a few blokes to save a pittance. Time is money eh.”
Churton raised the poignant fact that banks make an outrageous amount of money off interest on loaned monies which they often don’t physically have.
He said that “It’s a principal thing mate. I mean yes, it is also economic, but it just pisses me off to no end that I have to pay to access my money.”

Police confirm they punish officers by making them ride pushbikes

TEXT:

The Queensland Police for has confirmed this afternoon that they make officers they don’t like ride pushbikes.

The controversial admission has been confirmed by the Police Union, who say that troublesome staff are often forced onto bicycles as a form of punishment.

“We can confirm at this time that policemen who ride bikes are being punished,” said a police spokesman.

“The uniform and bike are also designed to be as embarrassing as possible.”

Inspired by police departments in Paris and other European cities which make naughty policemen and women patrol the streets on roller blades and Segways, the cycling crime fighters are a relatively new addition to the Betoota Police Force.

Local Probationary Constable Ellias Walter has only been in the police force for six months, but already he’s found himself riding around on a bike.

“I think it’s because I took out the breathalyser at the pub to see who was the most pissed out of all us boys,” he said.

“Sarge didn’t like that. Or it might’ve been the time I put photos of my missus topless on the Facebook holding my gun and baton. Sarge didn’t like that, either. So he makes me ride around on a bike now. Bloke hates me.”

Man trying his best to understand current situation in the Middle East

TEXT:

A local capital markets project assistant manager at a North Betoota investment bank has spent the overwheliming majority of his afternoon trying to wrap his head around the current situation in the Middle East, in particular, why they’ve all cut diplomatic ties with Qatar.

Michael Annerly understands that the gas-rich peninsula has done something bad, such as supported extremist groups and paid ransoms to Iran, or something like that, but what he can’t grasp why that’s cause for such dramatic action.

Earlier this week, seven Arab nations cut diplomatic ties with Qatar over developments that the country harboured terrorist groups and suggested that they supported Iran, which heavily frowned upon.

“Everyone is talking about how fucked everything is over there,” said the 27-year-old banking journeyman

“I tend to agree but I don’t understand why. They’re all off Qatar for some reason. It’s all over the news and the internet but nobody has done a good job on explaining it to me, you know?”

“Maybe I’m just a bit slow on the uptake. Maybe the Saudis have their tail up in the air after Trump’s visit. Who knows? [shrugs] I just feel a bit dumb.”

The Advocate offered to put Mr Annerly in touch with a Professor of Middle Eastern Studies at the East Betoota TAFE college, but he ultimately turned down the offer saying he didn’t really care that much, he just felt obligated to know what was going on.

Jackhammer Brought In To Remove Dried Porridge Off Bowl

Scientists have calculated that dried porridge has greater indentation strengths than diamond. Source.

Currently, diamond is regarded to be the hardest known material in the world – however, dads across the country have for years claimed that leftover porridge carelessly left in a ceramic bowl is on par with wurtzite boron nitride and lonsdaleite.

Local Betoota dad, Bruce (52) says the only meal he knows how to cook is often the hardest to clean up.

“These kids, mate” he says.

“They just leave it there for the maid”

“The maid is me by the way”

Bruce says aside from steel wool and a gurney, dried porridge can only be removed by a pneumatic or electro-mechanical tool that combines a hammer directly with a chisel.

Woman Marrying Sri Lankan Bloke Not Sure She Can Pull Off 23-Letter Wedding Hashtag

TEXT:

Betoota Hills resident, Samantha Keary has read every single Australian bridal magazine that has been printed in the last 18 months.

As a self-confessed bridezilla, she knows two things. One, her dress is costing more than the venue – and two, she needs a hashtag.

‘Wedding Hashtags’ are a relatively new phenomenon in modern Australian marriage ceremonies. While many newlyweds argue the hashtag is used to help them curate and archive all photos posted to social media by their guests – it is often misinterpreted as a bride’s opportunity to show off how beautiful her wedding was to a greater digital circle than her own

Unfortunately for Samantha, her husband-to-be, Todd, is of Sri Lankan heritage, meaning their hashtag is probably not going to take off.

Officially known as the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, the Island nation that Todd’s family originate from is situated just off south-east India. Sri Lanka has maritime borders with India to the northwest and the Maldives to the south-west – it is well known for its fucking long last names.

While Samantha toyed with #MeetTheWasalamudiyanses – she just isn’t confident that her slow-speaking relatives from Townsville will be able to get their head around the phonetics.

She also thought about placing notes at each table setting with #Todd&SamanthaGetMarried – but that was also too long, and Instagram doesn’t let you use non-numerical and letter characters.

“This is fucked” she says, only eight months out from the final day.

“Everything is ruined. Why couldn’t they just anglicise their fucking name like my family did when they got here”

While Todd is treading very lightly on this seemingly pointless issue, he says there is not a chance in frozen hell that he will be taking Samantha’s last name to avoid this issue.

“That seems like a pretty dramatic resolution” he says.

“I think I might lie and tell her about some spooky Sri Lankan ritual that means the only people who can take photos at Weddings is the fucking stoner I’m paying five grand to do it anyway”

Local 16-Year-Old Confident Parents Don’t Know What Watered Down Vodka Tastes Like

TEXT:

A popular student at the exclusive The  South Betoota Academy for Girls briefly spoke to The Advocate this morning about how she’s been getting away with stealing vodka and other spirits from her parents for weeks.

Emma, who asked to remain anonymous, said she replaces the vodka she takes with water and the brown spirits she’s forced to steal, at times, with tea.

“My parents don’t even drink that much,” she said. “When they do, it’s usually beer or wine. I can get away with this for ages I reckon, until the bottle is pretty much all water.”

“I mean, my Dad roller blades for exercise and goes on eco-holidays with Mum all the time. He’s not exactly a party animal. Same with mum, she just has a glass of Chardonnay with her Xanax in the afternoon and that pretty much does her.”

However, the clever Year 10 student is not as smart as she thinks – according to her father, Nathan.

Mr Cullahan, who asked not to remain anonymous, said that while he’s not the coolest boot in the shoe bin, he was once an affluent 16-year-old who also let wealth and privilege get to his head.

“Yeah look,” he said.

“I didn’t come down in the last shower. I know what she’s doing. At least she’s not stealing it from the shops. But yeah, we’ve all been there. Her Mum doesn’t know, yet. I don’ think she’d mind, then again she doesn’t really care about anything anymore,”

“Don’t ever get married, that’s the best advice I can give you. You know, I used to surf back in the day.”

Scientists Confirm Loudmouth 18-Year-Old On First Night Out Actually Is Bulletproof

A cocky young bloke who’s been walking around the pub like he’s bulletproof, actually is bulletproof, it has been confirmed by nearby scientists who just happened to be drinking in the same place.

The Lord Kidman Hotel’s local crowd in South Betoota just sit and watch on, as the near-invincible young fella keeps carrying on like a galah.

After jeering at a group of girls, yelling ‘taxi’ when an old codger dropped a glass and putting his hand over the bar to turn a tap on – 18-year-old Alistair Woodburn has been informed by the publican that he’s very lucky he actually is bulletproof.

“Mate! If you weren’t wearing military issue interceptor body armour complete with a deltoid and axillary protection system, side plate carrier, back extender and tier 2 Pelvic Protection – you’d be getting a hiding right now” roared the bartender.

The loudmouth youngster responded by saying “oooooh!” before putting his tongue through his forked fingers, mimicking the sexual act of cunnilingus.

Regulars say they are completely at odds about what to do, mainly because physical violence doesn’t look like it would be an effective way of dealing with the newcomer’s behaviour.

“Mate, if that kid wasn’t in close to 40 kilos of juggernaut body armour, I’d have lifted him hours ago” says Rod, a 55-year-old sparky.

“He’s a real smartarse, but for once in my life, violence isn’t going to solve anything”

Pet Casts Judgemental Stare At Owner During Kick-Ons

TEXT:

One thing led to another last Saturday night, forcing a group of South Betoota youths to head back to a Cordillo Road sharehouse with a big bag of cans and a burning desire to get legless.

Stacey Porterhouse put his hand up to host the kick-ons after a short discussion among the group outside the Betoota Dolphins Leagues Club.

“Oi go back in a get a big box of tins for the fellas, I’ve got wine coming out my ears but so the girls are sorted, aye?” yelled Stacey as two close friends, Will and Fred, lightly jogged around the west side of the complex and into the drive-through bottle-o.

The foursome then headed down Wilson Road to avoid the housing commission, before cutting back through Lafayette Park on their way to Cordillo.

“You’d be made walking through Kihee Estate with a whole bunch of piss and smokes,” explained Fred.  “They’d be scooping you up off the street and throwing you in a hole come morning time if you did.”

Though the mood was already good, Porterhouse’s 6-year-old Bearded Collie, Lucy, was there to greet them when they got home.

From there, the kick-on descended into something that neither person present wanted to remember – until somebody put Lucy on the table.

“That was pretty much it from there, we all lost our minds.”

“Haha it was so loose”

However, Lucy didn’t find it loose. In fact, for the slightly more sober house guests – it became very clear that Lucy was more than let down by the degenerate behaviour.

The malting pupper, who was happily asleep minutes ago, gives her owners a stare that would make anyone reassess their behaviour.

“What is wrong with you?” says those judgemental eyes.

“Take a look at yourselves”

Kids Toys On Floor Adds Plot Twist To One-Night-Stand

Study: Best Part About Being A Drama Teacher Is Bragging About Who You Studied With At NIDA

TEXT:

After a big day teaching improv to the stockbrokers, barristers and Liberal politicians of tomorrow, Mr Jensen throws on The Whitlams and puts away a couple bottles of red.

Despite a relatively healthy pay packet to be working in the field he loves, he knows the ‘art’ of theatre is lost on the boys of Saint Magnums College in East Betoota.

“I just didn’t see myself working here when I was at NIDA”

“I was at NIDA with Russel Crowe by the way”

“And David Wenham. My ex girlfriend ended up hooking up with him”

“Who else…. ummmmm… Oh yeah. Ian Roberts was there”

“Oh and Noni Hazelhurst”

Not only is his lifelong love of acting, lighting, stage design, singing and dancing trivialised and ridiculed on a daily basis by his students and their parents – but he is also being forced to coach a rugby team by the school’s executive staff.

“I don’t know a thing about Aussie Rules” he says.

“Why the fuck am I teaching contact sport after school hours?”

He says his inner-leftie is tested every day by the prestigious private school’s curriculum.

“I’m being made to teach these kids a revamped version of Secret River – where the white people are being oppressed by black cannibals”

“Not to mention the Eureka Stockade play, where the workforce are portrayed as HIV-suffering rapists and the cops are the good guys”

It’s days like this where Mr Jensen wonders if the screenplay he got three-quarters through in 1989 is still has enough momentum to turn into a fully-fledged stage production.

“I’m not sure if a dramatic thriller about a community radio announcer under Sir Joh’s government would really be that relevant anymore”

“Do people even get arrested for protesting these days?”

Mr Jensen says his life has come along way since he was knocked unconscious  for throwing marbles underneath a police horse during the Commonwealth Games, but he’s not going to die wondering.

“I’ve booked a cabin at Mount Tamborine. It’ll just me, my vape and the bellbirds for the next six months”

Local Meth Cook Says He Won’t Let The Robots Take His Job Without A Fight

TEXT:

A prominent East Betoota meth cook has lashed out at lesser media outlets for scaring the population by saying robots and automation will take their jobs in the coming years.

Bradley Dennis Kinkman explained to The Advocate this afternoon that online blogs such as The Courier-Mail and The Northern Times are ‘sensationalising a non-issue for clicks to appease their overlord Ronald Murdoch.’

He’s been cooking methamphetamine in the wider Diamantina area for nearly a decade.

“I’d like to see a robot take my job,” said the 28-year-old.

“Even if a robot could take my job, I’d like to see him try. I’ve got a Glock 23 down the back of my track pants. I’d be like the time I lost at SimCity and took to my laptop with a dog chain. Ganjaville was ready for a second airport, I don’t care what any cunt said,”

“But yeah, some robots are getting shot if they try anything. I’ve run over a cat before and I didn’t stop, I’ll do it again.”

A number of jobs, however, have already been lost to automation in Betoota.

Wendy Chamberlain lost her receptionist role here at The Advocate last year after she was replaced by an answering machine and a cigarette vending machine. She’s just one of many who tell a similar story.

“I used to answer the phones and run to the shops to buy smokes for the staff. I’ve been replaced by a heartless bitch who doesn’t even know to get Peter Stuyvesants when the times are good and Horizon 50s when they are bad.”

Man revvs the guts out of his XR8 to celebrate axing of Yassmin Abdel-Magied

A throaty chorus of eight cylinder motors rang out across West Betoota this morning as news of controversial Sudanese-Australian media personality Yassmin Abdel-Magied having her ABC television show cancelled filtered through town.

A month after attracting criticism for a tasteless ANZAC Day social media post, the ABC announced earlier this week that Australia Wide, a show presented by the 26-year-old, would not be renewed.

“It’s got nothing to do with that, you know, what happened earlier about ANZAC Day,” said one senior ABC executive.

“More or less, it’s about having our funding slashed. It’s also got nothing to do with the far-right lobby expressing their interest in planting explosives in our studios at the Ultimo Kremlin. We wish Ms Abdel-Magied the best in her future endeavours.”

That news was met with unbridled joy by many living on West Betoota’s exclusive Barrythorne Circuit, one of the wealthiest streets in the Diamantina Shire.

Lewis Pikeman, owner of the largest motorbike parts shop in the greater Betoota area, woke to the news this morning.

“Firs thing I did was grab the keys off the counter and head out onto the front lawn, where ‘the beast’ was parked,” he said.

“I didn’t even warm the cunt up. I just turned her over and put me foot to the floor, mate. Then all of a sudden, some of me neighbours did the same,”

Man’s own war against Islam began today with racial tirade on public transport

Retiree Peter Jenkins didn’t ask for any of the attention he’s currently receiving now, but he couldn’t sit idly by and watch his community decay any longer.

The 71-year-old former prison guard, still fresh from an afternoon sherry at the Betoota Dolphins Leagues Club, decided to do the right thing and get the bus home with his wife as even he agreed he was too intoxicated to drink.

That was when he became face-to-face with Nathan Ghafoor.

Mr Ghafoor is a seventh-generation Australian, whose forefathers arrived in the Diamantina in the early 1850s to drive camel trains. Not that it meant anything to Jenkins, who recently has been pushed to the limits regarding is anti-Islamic sentiments.

“What are you looking at? You [removed]?!” said Mr Jenkins, adding a generic racial slur as an afterthought.

And with that, every smartphone on the X45 to the Daroo Street Mall was unholstered and pointed at Jenkins.

“Mate, what’s the problem?” asked Nathan, who was just as taken back as the rest of the bus.

“You heard me, you fucking [removed] cunt, yeah but what?” replied Jenkins.

Moments after completing his last word, wife Beryl attempted to cover his mouth with her hand. Seconds later, he bit the top off her middle finger.

“I’m not finished with you, you bastard!” spitting the digit out into the aisle.

Mr Jenkins was later detained by constables from the South Betoota Police Station and questioned over a string of offences ranging from grievous bodily harm and offensive language.

He told detectives that he’s been under pressure at work, despite being retired, while also explaining that a number of family problems may have also contributed to the racial tirade.

Report: Happiest, healthiest countries still have smoking in pubs

TEXT:

A report commissioned by the World Health Organisation [WHO] has found that nearly all of the happiest, healthiest nations on the planet still allow smoking inside licensed pubs and clubs.

Denmark, recently named the happiest country in the world, still allows people to enjoy a cigarette with a cold beer inside. Patrons can even eat, smoke and consume alcohol at the same time if they wish.

Neighbouring Germany also has lax smoking laws and one of the highest rates of smoking globally. Yet somehow they enjoy a life expectancy on par with Australia.

“This will blow your mind,” said a WHO official.

“Japan, the nation with the highest life expectancy, has almost no restrictions on when and where you can get to work tarring the only road to your lungs,”

“You can sit down and enjoy a chilled bottle of wooded Chardonnay on the train to work in the morning and enjoy a smoke, too. Simply mind blowing.”

However, there’s more than one spot where the average Australian punter can enjoy some lung candy away from the harsh elements.

The Betoota Hotel does not enforce the leftist rhetoric of Roma Street and fails to bow to any chinless bureaucrat who tries to stick their beak where it does belong, according to manager Jock Campbell.

“You can smoke in my pub, I don’t give a fuck,” said Jock.

“Aiding to our isolation, we don’t really get in trouble for doing. Christ, the local copper in town comes in at the end of a long day and lights up,”

“Just let the boys and girls play, it is what it is then you die.”

16-year-old’s world rocked after being forced to read Catcher in the Rye for English class

TEXT:

A Year 10 student at a prestigious South Betoota secondary school has had his world turned upside down after being required to read Catcher in the Rye for English class.

Though he admits it’s the first book he’s read cover-to-cover, Alistair Momms-Boltons said the book’s protagonist Holden Caufield speaks to him on a personal level – that somebody else his age feels the same way he does about the world and all the ‘phoney bullshit’ that comes with being alive.

“I thought I was the only one going through this type of shit,” said the Queens College pupil.

“But after reading Catcher, it became my favourite book because it spoke to me, spoke to me on such a level that I thought nobody could. I’m basically the Holden Caufield of my wide friendship circle. I’m the outsider.”

Alistair’s English teacher has echoed the misunderstood youth’s sentiments, saying that this type of thing happens every year – but young Ali’s period of introspection after reading the book is lasting much longer than usual.

Teacher Brett Conway explained to The Advocate that though the 1951 J.D. Salinger classic is still taught in classrooms around the world for that very reason.

“I didn’t know it affected Mr Momms-Boltons so much,” said Conway.

“He’s even tried talking to me about the unofficial prequel to the book, The Ocean Full of Bowling Balls, which I didn’t even know existed. Apparently, it was leaked onto the internet some years ago, I might have to look it up,”

“But yeah, back to what I was saying. He’s a good kid, but what he’s going through isn’t exactly unique.”

Local father ring barks the family avocado tree to spite his stay-at-home son

TEXT:

A grown man living at home with his parents has had his easy and free access to avocados cut off my his father, who ring-barked the family avocado tree to spite him.

Citing the aggressive and expensive rental market in Betoota’s trendy Old City District, Stephen Poltergeist a local youngtrepreneur, said he wouldn’t be able to afford to move out of home and enjoy the same standard of living he does with his parents.

But that comes at a cost to his parents, who say they’re sick to death of having the 26-year-old living under their roof.

“You should see the cunt,” said father Miles Poltergeist.

“He gets out of bed at 10, picks an avocado off the tree in the back yard and fucks around on his phone until lunch then maybe, maybe he might think about doing something. I’ve had enough. So I ringbarked the avocado tree to spite the layabout prick,”

“I love him, that’s why I had to kill the tree. So he’d have to buy his own and move out. I’ve tried charging him for rent but his mother ups me for being too hard on him. He was fucking two years old when I was his age!”

Hitting back at his father, Stephen said that killing the avocado tree was a bit drastic and childish.

“Dad’s been reading The Australian again I see,” he said.

“They said the youth’s penchant for avocados is keeping them out of the property market, so I guess he put two and two together,”

“He’s got quite a large property portfolio as it is, perhaps I should encourage him to keep smoking?”

“I don’t regret it”: Local man lies and says he doesn’t regret getting spacers

TEXT:

Swanning around the sales department of The Advocate in his $99 off-the-rack suit, account coordinator Gavin Mole-Turner lets his stretched ear lobes jiggle and jangle with each flick of his head.

The 29-year-old was a latchkey kid from the start, who quickly grew up misunderstood and angry.

“I found solace in music,” said Gavin, who started here at The Advocate late last year.

“Part of the subculture, part of the nu-metal crowd I found myself in as a high schooler, was to get spacer earrings. That was then. Now people ask me if I regret getting them done, which I say I don’t. I don’t regret it.”

However, a pal of Gavin’s spoke with our reporters this afternoon. She painted a very different picture of his headspace back when he decided enough was enough and he pulled the spacers out for the last time.

The moment happened at a local music festival.

“It was at The Betoota Small Farm Field Days. Sneaky Sound System was playing at the night time disco after all the olds had gone home. I remember it clear as day,” she said.

“There we were just having a boogie, minding our own business, when some punk kids came up and locked a big heavy padlock through Gavin’s right earring. Then they ran off like cowards into the crowd. But poor Gav had this lump of metal locked to his head for hours – until we got home and his old man cut it off with a hacksaw,”

“It was pretty funny, though.”

When asked whether Gavin regrets getting the spacers, his pal said yes – and if he says he didn’t, he’s a liar.

He did so because a waiter asked him to, so she wouldn’t have to walk another lap around the E. H. Pearson Function Centre with two rapidly chilling finger foods on her platter.

“Go on Stagecoach,” said Caroline, the waiter mentioned above.

“Be a darl and hoover up these for me, will ya?”

The 34-year-old Volkswagen salesmen paused and looked at his fiance of 7-years Maybelle, who rolled her eyes and said yes.

“Don’t mind if I do, Caro,” said Mr Lawrence as he picked up the party pie and chicken rice paper roll with the dexterity of Charlie Teo.

However, that’s where his act of good faith and plan for a quick stomach liner came to an end.

Popping the pie into his gob first, he mashed it against the roof of his mouth with his tongue – expelling the molten contents all through his mouth.

“Fuck me cunt!” he yelled as he let the hot mince drip out of his agape pie hole and onto the floor.

“Christ all mighty! Fuck that was hot!”

Bloke Living With Parents Cautiously Divides Attention Between Laptop And Bedroom Door

TEXT:

A local idiot who has found himself back at his parent’s house has rediscovered the extremely stressful predicament of having a family member burst into his room at any given moment.

The fact that his mum could come rolling in with the laundry basket as late as 10:00pm has made life very difficult for the 28-year-old named Jack, who has been living out of home since his first year of uni in 2006.

“It’s multitasking 101” he says, with a smirk that shows he’s not sure if he’s proud or hilariously disappointed in himself.

“You never know what you’re going to be interrupted doing”

Jack is what modern anthropologists refer to as a Boomerang Child. Meaning, he had a crack at the real world and has now come crawling back. Maybe it’s because he spends more time trying to find the right time to rub one out then he does looking for a high paying job.

Boomerang children and those who never leave — so-called “failure to launch” children — are fast becoming “normal” in Australia and the Western world, according to researchers.

“This is not just an Australian phenomenon. In fact, across the entire Western world we are finding young adult children living with their parents much later than they were 20, 50 years ago,” said associate professor Walter Langer of the University of Western Queensland

“What we have found is these young people develop very observant skillsets, as well as the ability to quickly hide under a doona”

Apprentice Builder Sent Home For Hooking Into Quiche At Smoko

TEXT:

A prominent local master builder has sent his 17-year-old apprentice home early today after watching him eat a cold quiche for smoko.

Visibly shaken by the ordeal, McCarthur Projects owner Miles Hanford said he couldn’t believe his eyes when offsider Jason Moulin hooked into the eggy treat.

“I mean, he already drives an automatic Falcon ute. That I was prepared to overlook, but the quiche? No way,” said the 48-year-old builder.

“He was lucky nobody else saw him do it. He’d be laughed off the site and my reputation would be completely ruined. He doesn’t even come to the pub on Thursdays and Fridays to sink cold ones with the boys and watch the league,”

“He goes home and drinks cordial while he watches fucking soccer. But he’s a good young builder, but fuck me.”

Hitting back at his boss, Jason said he politely declines each invitation to come drink with the boys at the pub after work because he’s 17.

He’s also a vegetarian, meaning that hoeing into a Four’n’Twenty rat coffin at 10am isn’t going to happen.

“Mate, I know it’s a bad look, but I’m a vego so I eat quiche,” he said.

“I also don’t like league. My Mum’s from Perth and my old man is French. Cunt, how much rugby league do you think gets played in my household. The answer is none,”

“Anyway, Miles gave me the day off for eating a quiche. I bet the old fuck head is having fun carrying all his gear around today the fucking idiot.”

Man Tries But Fails To Have A Bad Time At The Zoo

TEXT:

A year-long study conducted by The Royal Zoological Society of Betoota has concluded that it’s basically impossible to have a bad time at a zoo.

Staff and customers at The Betoota Zoo were surveyed over the past 12 months to gauge their satisfaction levels and overall pleasure while visiting the landmark establishment on the South Betoota city limits.

“Out of the seven thousand people interviewed about their time at the park, only four said they didn’t have fun,” said Zoological Society chairwoman Louise Frost.

“And those four people only had a bad time after a peacock found its way into the bonobo enclosure, where they witnessed the bird being violently dismembered by the apes. We understand that could’ve been distressing, so we offered them a free return visit,”

“That and the time a deranged gunman shot our last Galapagos tortoise, but those who witnessed that event ultimately found it hilarious. One patron said it’s not everyday you see a giant tortoise being shot with a snub-nose .38 by a man still wearing his pyjamas.”

The news has ushered in a new era for the Betoota Zoological Park, who revealed to The Advocate this morning that the study’s findings have buoyed visitor numbers in recent weeks.

“It seems the secret is out!” said Ms Frost.

“If you come to the zoo and have a bad time, then you should go home and look at yourself in the mirror and ask yourself if anything in this world actually makes you happy.”

“I drink Tooheys Extra Dry because I enjoy disrespecting myself and bringing great shame upon my entire family”

TEXT:

The Advocate spoke to the last Tooheys Extra Dry drinker in town this morning to ask him why he does what he does, despite the limp-handshake-lager falling out of vogue some ten years ago.

“It’s not that I like the taste or the reasonable price,” said Damien, a local bank person.

“I drink Tooheys Extra Dry [TED] because I get a real kick out of disrespecting myself and embarrassing my family. Don’t ask me why, but I get all giddy and funny in the head whenever I order one down the pub. The barmaid even looks me up and down and recoils a bit,”

“I get off on that. Don’t kink-shame me, bro.” he explained, unfortunately.

Betoota Hotel manager Jack Conwell said he still orders a case of it atop the first pallet of the month that comes up from Dan Murphy’s in Toowoomba just for Damien, who asked to remain somewhat anonymous.

However, he refused to speak on the matter any further, saying he’s already an enabler and he’s not exactly proud of that either.

“He grunts and ‘shimonas’ like Michael Jackson each time he takes a sip. It’s pretty full on, but his money is as plastic as everybody else’s,” he said.

“But yeah, sometimes he spits it on himself and writhes around in his chair. Fucking TED drinkers, man. Strange fish.”

High-Pitch Giggles Coming From Footy Shed Suggests Islander Players Are Dancing Again

TEXT:

Coaches and other spectators are puzzled by what could have triggered the high-pitched giggling fit currently taking place in the home-side changerooms at the Betoota Dolphins clubhouse this morning.

After a close win against the Boulia Breakers, most first-grade players have since dispersed into the crowd to talk to their parents and girlfriends ahead of presentations, however, it seems the Polynesian players, as well as the assistant manager and the front rowers, are still fucking around in the sheds.

Team captain, Ryan Carton (33) says he can almost bet what is happening in the sheds right now.

“I guarantee you Serevi has taken control of the BOSE speakers and is blaring UB40 or Frank Ocean” said Carton.

It is believed that several of the clubs stockier whitefellas have uncovered a deep-seated lover for slow jamz, after being introduced to the music by the Islander teammates.

“Greg (run-on prop) had never heard r’n’b music until our bus trip to Windorah last month”

“He’s probably in there moving his hips and singing for the boys as we speak”

With the words “Sing soleh!” echoing out of the changerooms as well as “Oh Oh Oh!” following by near-hysterical giggling – spectators are left to assume that the entire showers are now looking like something out of a Chris Brown video clip – as both the Polynesian and Caucasian forwards bond over their love of hip hop dancing.

Student Hopes His Presence At Christmas Lunch Will Count As A Present

TEXT:

The youngest-of-four, Morgan Stapleman says he’s long been the source of ridicule from his older siblings and parents.

He’s preparing for that to continue come Christmas Day as the broke 20-year-old gaming attendant doesn’t have enough money to buy his family presents for Christmas.

“I still have a prepaid phone,” he said. “I can’t even trust myself to hop on a plan.”

So to put his mind at ease, the Ceramic Art student is hoping that his mere presence at his brother’s four-bedder in a leafy North Betoota cul-de-sac will be a present in itself.

“My mother doesn’t really expect much of me this time of year, she knows I’d rather spend my money drinking myself I shit the bed than buy her a nice pan or Dad a new pair of secateurs,” he said.

“She’s good like that. I think she was doing the same thing when she was my age.”

The delinquent Virgo’s sentiments were echoed by his mother Gwendolyn, who said she knows her young fucks up all the time, but it’d be nice to see him.

“Just as long as he brushes his teeth,” she said.

“Last year, we could hear him vomiting in the front yard before he came in with a used hot water bottle wrapped in newspaper, which he then gave gifted. I gave it back to him at the end of the day, because I know he needs it more than me,”

“The thought was nice, though.”

Local high schooler tentatively googles Pink Floyd tour dates after buying shirt

It arrived this morning before school.

The British prog-rock group’s most successful line disbanded in 1985, with three original members electing to carry on throughout the 90’s to meet mixed critical and commercial acclaim.

However, the band’s music isn’t what inspired Matthew Coolidge to buy a tee shirt sporting one of their album covers, he just saw a celebrity wearing one and thought it was the cat’s pyjamas.

“I saw Harry Styles wearing one and I thought, ‘Hey that’s cool,’ so I got one, then I started listening to the actual music and it wasn’t half bad. It goes for fucken ages and you have to skip ahead to the cool parts, but yeah, I liked it,” said the 16-year-old.

“I googled them but it said they broke up ages ago but got back together. They released an album like three years ago or something, so I was just wondering if they were still touring with it,”

“Yeah turns out they’re not. One of the dudes is full on dead. Worth a try, but.”

Local Coward Takes A Slash In Cubicle Even Though There’s Space At The Trough

Timid local man, Dave Edmund’s insecurities were on show for all yesterday afternoon, when he opted against joining a couple of complete strangers at the urinal of the Lord Kidman hotel is South Betoota.

The 19-year-old data entry expert was seen walking into the men’s bathrooms for a piss, only two be confronted by two other blokes standing on the steel grate at the urinal.

With both men looking at him, Dave briefly hesitated with the idea of finding a spot between the two of them, before ultimately deciding to use one of the empty cubicles.

Even though Dave left the door open, his actions have been widely condemned by the regulars.

“It was very disappointing. I don’t know what it is with these young fellas” said one of the blokes at the trough, a 65-year-old postie named Reg, who was left feeling snubbed by Dave.

“Don’t know if I can trust any of ’em”

After returning to a table of his mates, Dave’s lack of bathroom etiquette was briefly forgotten, until the publican was made aware of his behaviour by some of the regulars.

“Mate, that’s not how we do things around here” roared the pub-owner, Bruce Brachetta.

“The toilet is for shitting, or other equally hard to talk about bodily functions. Stand-up-pissing is completely unacceptable”

Opposing fourth grade teams agree not to tackle anybody on the cricket pitch

TEXT:

The Betoota Dolphins fourth-grade side are scheduled to play the Adavale Pigeons tomorrow morning on Leonard Oval 4, the football field with the cricket pitch right on half way.

Notorious for causing horrific rash injuries should a player be unlucky enough to be tackled in the middle of the ground, this time around the two captains of the opposing teams have made a gentleman’s agreement to not tackle anybody on it.

“This isn’t the first day of the Somme,” said Dolphins captain Keith Du Santos.

“There’s no room for heroics in a fourth-grade clash, we’re here for the fun of it – and maybe some glory. But there’s never an excuse to be picked up and dropped on a cricket pitch. It’s simply inhumane.”

Du Santos’ sentiments were echoed by the Pigeons’ captain, who explained that “it’s a long way home if you’ve been repeatedly spear tackled on something like a sharp, abrasive cricket pitch.”

“I think it’s common sense,” said captain Emmet Marlow.

“We’re all farmers, ringers, fencers, labourers and so on. We can’t really afford to leave a third of our leg skin on a cricket pitch in Betoota. It’s just not worth it. So we made this agreement so we can all have a good time.”

The Betoota Dolphins are a dual-code rugby team and are locked in to play the Windorah Goblins on Sunday afternoon in Windorah.

Local Man Opens Can Of Beer With His Head

A local ringer has impressed hundreds of racegoers at the annual Quilpie Digger’s Cup by opening a can of Betoota Bitter with his forehead.

Witnesses says they were initially under the impression that Paul Holsen (19) did not know how to open a beer the normal way, until it became clear that it was just a run-of-the-mill party trick that he occasionally pulls out if he’s got a cigarette in his other hand.

“It was amazing” said one fashions of the field winner, Shayleigh Tully.

“I had no idea that you could open a beer by smashing the can into your head with that much force”

It is believed the plain-looking agricultural professional from Betoota was instantly met with the interest of several ladies.

Recent substitute teacher, Andrew Smith (23) has today blown away his temporary Grade 7 class at South Betoota Primary School by his ability to correctly pronounce one of the more complicated student surnames.

During the 9am roll call, Mr Smith showed his worldliness by successfully pronouncing 13-year-old Sarah Remienko’s ‘exotic’ family name.

The newly certified educator paused briefly before tackling the gruelling task of a four-syllable word of Polish background.

“… Sarah… Rem-ee-yenk-oh? Is Sarah here?” he asked.

The entire class sat still in awe before a noticeably cheerful Sarah responded with a timid “here”.

By little lunch, the entire school was talking about the new substitute’s amazing way with words.

SBPS Principal, Mrs Lawson says it’s a refreshing change to host a teacher who knows how to pronounce names that aren’t Smith or Jones.

“It’s a shame we’ll be kicking this young bloke out on his arse the moment Mrs Duignan gets back from maternity leave”

Teamates rejoiced as they proudly declared to the referee that they were going to be able to run an entire team, but if anyone gets injured – its off.

Local Publican Under Impression Patrons Enjoy Playing Pool On A Hexagonal Table

TEXT:

Many East Betoota punters were left scratching their heads earlier this week after a prominent local publican made the decision to put a hexagonal pool table in his popular establishment.

The Royal Commerical Hotel has been an East Betootanese drinking institution for nearly two hundred years and despite undergoing a number of facelifts and renovations, the pub remains as popular as ever.

But that unabridged popularity has been put to the test by new licensee Brett Nathanson, who took over the running of the hotel earlier this year.

Replacing the jukebox with a pinball machine was the first controversial decision made by the Toowoomba native, the second being the hexagonal pool table.

“We’re heading in a new direction with the Royal Commie,” said the 34-year-old publican.

“We play good music here now. The P.O.D and Limp Bizkit CDs inside the old jukebox were almost worn down to the label they were played so much. Yuck! Anyway, we got rid of the old pool table because it was too big. The hexagonal one is fun and different. This is just the start of the changes I want to make.”

Suburban Motorist Shows Working Class Solidarity By Giving Two-Finger-Wave To Stop Go Man

Local motorist, Josh Croucher (34) is high on life after today’s interaction with a traffic controller, who was directing cars around a new road sealing project in the back streets behind his Betoota Heights office.

After roughly four to five minutes of uncomfortable eye contact, the traffic controller received radio confirmation that motorists were now allowed to cross the intersection. His signal was met with a very blokey two finger wave from the local printing salesman.

Josh was seen to be transitioning very slowly into a lighter gear, while waiting for the lollipop man to acknowledge the wave that he had given in response to the initial signal to drive past.

“Yeah. It’s just what we do around here” he says.

“Just give ’em a wave. They are out here all day”

The traffic controller in question says it’s not uncommon to get the old two-finger, or even three-finger wave from dorky suits driving around the suburb.

“I get like 386 two-finger waves a day. These people don’t even know me”

“I don’t wave at them when they sign off on a sale of 500 menus for the local pizza joint, why do they wave at me?”

“I’m just doing my job”

“I’ve tried to not even make eye contact and just signal to the car as a whole – instead of the person in it, but they usually slow down until they are looking at me out the driver window”

Josh says seeing these blokes out here working the roadside reminds him of his two month stint as a labourer before he attended uni 15 years ago.

Local Creep Saves Mint Leaves Lollies Until Last

A local weirdo has spent the last couple of days subconsciously navigating around the Homebrand spearmint lollies on the kitchen bench.

The reason? Because he likes them the most and wants to save the best until last.

30-year-old IKEA floor manager, Bevan Cochrane says the missus doesn’t often let him tear open a 400 gram of Allens lolly rip-off, but when she does he meticulously starts from the pineapples, then the red frogs, onto the strawberry drops.

“I save the best ’til last ha ha ha” he says, through green-tinted teeth.

Bevan’s wife of 5 years, Fliss, says her husband is starting to develop some really weird “dad-tastes”.

“When we were driving out the Warwick the other day for a family wedding… He pulled into the servo and bought everyone a bottle of sarsaparilla…”

When asked on where it is you’re supposed to look, Vacante revealed the key areas one should focus if you want the photo to look as natural or “accidental” as possible.

“Definitely down towards the ground is where you want to be looking. Unless you’re standing with a friend, then you can tilt the angle down gently towards your friend’s person, be it their feet, cleavage, whatever.

“Whatever you do, just don’t look directly at the camera man. Sure you had to ask him for the snap, but as soon as he agrees to it – look straight down!”

Vacante also says to not be shy when it comes to checking with the photographer that the shot came out okay, and not be afraid to do re-shoots if it’s not quite right.

“Eventually the photographer will just give in and let you do as many shots as you want til you really nail that, ‘I really don’t care how I look in this photo’ vibe.”

A top-rating Betoota FM radio station has been forced to apologise after failing to warn listeners that there’d be a 20-min gap between Ed Sheeran songs, which led to an unprecedented 600 complaints made to the broadcast ombudsman.

Ex-Steiner School Kid Struggles To Count Past Ten Without Her Bongo Drum

TEXT:

A recent graduate of the Betoota Heights Steiner School has exceeded her own expectations by mastering basic arithmetic in the face of overwhelming odds.

Dennise Carp, 19, finished her Queensland Certificate of Education (QCE) last year with an OP 22, which even she finds hard to believe.

Going on to endure the shame of counting with her fingers in public, the creative Scorpio set about remedying her complete lack of mathematical knowledge.

“At my Steiner high school, they taught us to embrace who we are. To look deep within one’s self to find out our place in the world,” she said.

“Unfortunately, that didn’t involve learning anything vaguely useful. My teachers tried to teach us our times tables with slam poetry and tambourines, but that wasn’t going to work out, was it? So I set about fixing that myself.”

“The school still stands by teaching us basic maths through whip cracking and bongo drum exercises”

Ordering a small variety of primary school math textbooks online, Carp said she had problems at first – but slowly overcame them with a little patience and determination.

“How crazy is division? It’s like numbers inside of numbers, like people in a car or fish in a pond,” she said.

“I can add up in my head like a grown up. Until ten. But I keep a mini bongo drum in my purse if I need to go higher”

Bloke With Large Melon Not Allowed To Try On Mate’s Sunnies

TEXT:

A local bloke is very well aware that he has a melon much bigger than most of his mates.

Since young adulthood, Sam Perrington hasn’t been able to engage in friendly banter with anyone without the size of his noggin’ being brought up.

Because of this, the 32-year-old boilermaker from West Betoota, has not been able to engage in either a light-hearted or serious argument with his mates for as long as he can remember. He also isn’t allowed to wear other people’s new sunnies.

He says anytime it looks like he has the upper-hand in a battle of the minds – the size of his scone is brought up.

Recently Sam found himself in a heated debate surrounding rugby league stats.

“I’m telling you morons. Scotty Prince was the first footballer to play for all three Queensland clubs. Look it up” yelled Sam.

“Yeah whatever dickhead. You’re full of shit” says his mate, Brodie, while pulling out his phone to google the subject.

Silences takes ahold of the room as Brodie realises he is actually wrong.

“Yeah righto you big-headed cunt. Maybe that’s why you’ve got that basketball sitting on your shoulders. To keep useless shit like this inside it”

The entire room erupts as everyone forgets that Sam was actually correct and the attention turns to how big his head is.

The boys start chanting “Melon, melon, melon”

New Study Confirms: Enjoying A Dart In The Pool Is The Height Of Luxury

TEXT:

Australia’s peak scientific body revealed the findings of a new study this afternoon that set out to discover what the height of luxury is – causing some controversy in the process.

The CSIRO came to the conclusion that the must enjoyable, luxurious activity a human being can do is to enjoy a ‘premium’ cigarette such as a Peter Stuyvesant Filter or a Benson & Hedges Smooth and enjoy it while relaxing in a pool.

“Surprising, to say the least,” said one researcher.

“The telephone survey canvased over two-thousand Australians from various backgrounds and heritages and they all said they loved smoking durries in the pool more than anything else. Shocking, but telling.”

The news is music to the ears of tobacco growers and cigarette manufacturers, who’ve long championed having a smoke while swimming.

Stopping short of saying it’s vindicated his entire industry, a spokesman from British American Tobacco explained to The Advocate that Australians have been enjoying lung candy in the pool for generations – and this new study proves that point.

“We agree, smoking in the pool is the height of luxury,” she said.

“When accompanied by an ice cold beer or glass of rosé, the feeling of pleasure knows no bounds.”

Old Codger At The Pub Wants To Know Who Opened Up A Can Of Good Sorts

“Who opened up a can of good sorts? You pretty things don’t want to be in a place like this. These young fellas are no-hopers”

“Look at the pins old the one in the silk” he says while looking directly at the smiling female patron who thinks he’s too old and cute to be held accountable for his sleazy comments.

“I tell you what a figure like that would have kept me awake at night when I was a young fella”

First-year politics student becomes expert in French politics overnight

A 19-year-old politics student at South Betoota Technical College is the talk of the town this afternoon after becoming an expert in the ins and outs of the French political system overnight.

Close to a dozen of his classmates swooned over Gregor Liston, who now sports a gleaming hickey, as he regaled them with humorous and insightful anecdotes and explanations of what people can expect in the ongoing French election.

“Yeah [laughs] last night was wild,” said Liston as he pulled his hood off his neck, exposing the hickey.

“And I’m not talking about Le Pen! Crazy, huh? Anyway, I’ve been following the French election for quite some times now. In fact, I’ve been enamoured with the entire political system of the Fifth Republic since forever. But yeah, I’m basically the go-to guy on campus when it comes to anything politique française.”

Man’s faith in world tested as Gogglebox wins Best Factual Programme Logie

TEXT:

A South Betoota shopkeeper had his faith in humanity tested last night as he watched the TV Week Logie Awards from behind the counter of his local mixed business.

Walter Kowalczyk often watches a number of commercial television programs of an evening while he works, giving the 65-year-old an all-encompassing knowledge of what’s hot and what’s not.

“Honestly, my entire left side went numb for a second and I thought I was having a stroke when they gave Gogglebox, which is the cold sore on the face of Australian television, a Logie for being the best factual program,” he said.

“The only thing factual about it is its honest deposition of the bottom drawer of society. The type of sucked mango seed that eats dinner curled up on the couch watching television. It’s enough to make me want to go back to Poland where we savour our food and make it an event.”

Hitting back at Walter was a local spinster, Angela Cottle, who told The Advocate that she rushes home from her job at the Davidson Abattoirs to enjoy programs such as Gogglebox, Naked News and The Footy Show.

The 38-year-old day-shift meat lumper said that while she understood why some people think they’re above programs such as the ones mentioned earlier, she’s not.

“I used to like smart person things like the ABC and rugby union, but I had a near-drowning experience when I was 25 and my brain was starved of oxygen for like 6 minutes,” she said.

“When I woke up in the hospital, I discovered that I didn’t like those things anymore. I liked shows like The Biggest Loser and My Kitchen Rules, but Gogglebox is my all time favourite. Sometimes I’m glad that part of my brain died that day out on the waterhole. But I’d also like to have the ability to tie my shoes and play with my yo-yo sometimes.”

Student says she’d shave her head for wine money before doing it for charity

A struggling South Betootan TAFE student has revealed to The Advocate this afternoon that she’d be open to raising money by shaving her head – but only if it was in support of her own rampant alcoholism.

Citing that most charities are just rip off merchants that play on the heart strings of the naive and weak, Samantha Taylors-Ross explained that five grand would change her life for the better and if all that stood between her and a pile of cold hard Claude Monet was her hair, it’d be gone in a flash.

“You see, people like Sinead O’Connor and Peter Garrett didn’t shave their heads to get Instagram likes or money for some wok-eyed do-gooder group that pretends to feed or clothe the poor,” she said.

“They did it for money and attention, which is exactly what I’d do. I’d turn that into wine and anxiety before I knew what day it was.”

Attending the GumNutterz Festival out on the Betoota city limits last weekend, Greg Portman was eager to shed the Tarocash uniform he’s forced to wear to work each day for something a little bit more befitting of his left-leaning politics.

Wearing cut-off jean shorts and a handsome, joyful and charming vest complete with oilskin gaiters – the immoral ensemble none the less offended his 68-year-old father who happened to stumble across images on his wife’s social media accounts.

“Stone the fucking crows, get a load of this shit,” said his cleft-palated Dragons diehard father, Gus.

“Look at what Greg wore to that fucking bush doof. He looks like he’s there to lift shirts and loiter around the toilets. Christ all-mighty. You know, you do all the right things as a father.

High School Acquaintance At Hometown Pub Drops His Fourth ‘So How Ya Been, Mate?’

Punctuating each sentence with the ‘Oi, but seriously,’ prefix, a local Dorper stud manager asked the same bloke how his was last night down at The Betoota Hotel a record for times – in the same conversation.

Nathan Decanter often speaks highly of the sheep business, telling the cattlemen who also frequent the bottom pub in town just how lazy they are for giving up on sheep.

But one thing he’s become locally known for is his love of standing in circles with the boys and getting a good buzz on and asking blokes how they are all night. Especially the old school mates visiting home for the long weekend.

“Yeah but, somebody has to do it, you know, but?” said Decanter.

“Christ, I know I can harp on a bit, let the jibber get the better of me sometimes, but I’m just trying to maintain a healthy dialogue, you know? It’s better than half those town rats running around out in the beer garden high on that ice, trying to keep out of the lights and whatnot. Not for me,”

“Asking blokes how they are gives you a minute or two to organise your thoughts when you’ve had a couple and you get to that point where you’re like, ‘fuck me dead, I’m fucken blind. Not even Fred Hollows can get me out a this one. Yeehaw!’ You know what I mean, joog?”

Moree man performs ancient courtship display of spitting rum on potential mate

TEXT:

You’d be mistaken for thinking ‘Moree Man’ was the next comic book hero to be brought to the silver screen, but you wouldn’t be too far wrong.

Left on the cutting room floor of the BBC’s groundbreaking nature documentary Planet Earth II, was a rare courtship display filmed by the British crew which showed a husky, but handsomely svelt young man spitting rum and coke on potential mate – a local custom.

“It was incredible,” said BBC producer Alan Rochford.

“We’d read about it, the rum spitting courtship. On a whim, we travelled to Moree to try to capture this moment – and we did. It’s unfortunate that it didn’t make the final cut, but it should appear as a DVD extra.”

Depicted in the lost footage was Josh Watson, son of a local diesel mechanic and high school teacher.

His large frame and towering height to his advantage, the retired 29-year-old hooker consumed the last of his seventh tankard of Bundy and coke and spat it across the public bar – showing scores of young ladies in the sticky pheromone.

“Fuck he’s a pig,” said Sally Watkins, a local solicitor.

“If my brother was here and he saw that, Josh’d fitting on the floorboard while the barman called for the air ambulance. I’m talking some serious brain bruising here, my brother’s been in the pen. He wouldn’t be the same bloke when he woke up, that’d be for sure.”

Despite this, Watson dismissed the obvious disgust people have with being spat on as a joke.

“My grandfather spat rum people, my father spat rum on people, now I spit rum on people,” he said.

“Grow up fuck ya.”

Sydney’s Coogee Beach receives Irish Gaelic street signs to aid local residents

A campaign by Coogee residents, in Sydney’s eastern provinces, to erect Irish Gaeilge street signs has won over local council this week, heralding a new era of acceptance in the region.

Donagh Moloney, originally of Letterkenny in the Irish Republic, emigrated to Australia in the early 1990s and has called Coogee home since then.

However, he noticed that a number of his countrymen had also made the antipodal jump Down Under – but hadn’t the English skills to navigate around County Coogee without having to stop and ask for directions.

“While we’ll always consider ourselves to be Irish, we love it here in Sydney,” explained the 39-year-old builder.

“But not all of us had the same opportunities to learn English as youngsters. While folk like me did have the chance, there were plenty of young Irish my age who know more about making pipebombs than they do about speaking the Queens,”

“So this is why I started the campaign for the Gaeilge street signs. To help the fresh arrivals. To help my people feel more at home.”

Discovery Of Oil Reserves In Betoota Drives Petrol Prices Back Down To 70 Cents A Litre

TEXT:

After the recent discovery of oil in the Diamantina Shire, the Betoota BP fuel and diner has today announced that the prices for unleaded are the cheapest they have ever been since Petero Civoniceva first started played for the Brisbane Broncos.

The service station has paid homage to this by plastering a photo of Petero’s head on the priceboard out the front, instead of the actual numerical value of petrol per litre.

After 39 reserve grade games, the Redclifee Dolphins product began his NRL career as a centre with the Brisbane Broncos. He won the club’s Rookie of the Year award in 1998 and went on to play from the bench in Brisbane’s 1998 NRL grand final win at the end of the season.

It was during this stellar debut season that Petero Civoneca earned his lifelong nickname, initially annointed to him by Roy & HG – “Petrol 70-cents-a-litre” – due to his engine-like ability to keep moving forward – that and the fact that petrol was actually 70 cents a litre in 1998.

However, with the prices back to the same cost as they were 19 years ago, Petero’s face will remain on the sign out front – until the international oil and gas corporates begin selling majority of the resources overseas and drive the prices back up.

TEXT:

The licensee of the Betoota Sailing Club has noticed business has been on the rise in recent weeks, however, the clientele has shifted away from being a more family orientated venue to an almost university-sports-club type vibe.

“It was a mystery to the staff until I had a barback ask if he could work on these very specific evenings,” said publican Ralph Marcescence.

“He said he wanted to work on these nights because his missus would force him to curl up sober on the couch and watch The Real Housewives of Sydney, something that he obviously didn’t enjoy doing,”

“Then it hit me, blokes were coming here to get out of watching that programme. Christ, one night the only sport on was college ice hockey, but the blokes were in here screaming at the television, getting behind Kansas State in their battle to become conference champions against some other fucking team, I don’t remember.”

After making the discovery, Marcescence said he put together a few and drink deals with word spreading like a grass fire up a steep hill.

Ten dollars will get you a bowl of potato gems and a pony of Betoota Bitter. Gravy is an extra dollar and you can super-size it up to a jug and a gem bucket for $20.

Refugee who keeps leaving doors open confirms he was born in a tent

An insensitive South Betootanese primary teacher has come under fire this afternoon for asking a new arrival to the region if he was born in a tent.

Speaking to The Advocate just moments ago, Hazim Al-Kannada, 8, said he was asked a fairly straightforward question and he simply gave a straightforward answer.

The year two student at St Benedicts Primary was asked why he keeps leaving doors open whenever he leaves or enters the classroom by his teacher Paul McConnor, who jokingly asked if he was born in a tent – how the popular saying goes.

“Yeah, I know I leave doors open,” said Hazim. “I don’t know why, it’s just something I do. But Mr McConnor asked if I was born in a tent because I always leave doors open, so I guess that’s got something to do with it.”

Just as the teacher made the remarks, school principal Gwendolyn Musgrove walked past in earshot.

Horrified, she asked to speak to Mr McConnor briefly out in the corridor.

“She asked me, ‘Do you have rocks in your fucking head, cunt? Of course, he was born in a tent. Not many Iraqis are born on Nauru by choice, are they?’ and then the penny dropped,” he said.

“So I went in and apologised to Hazim and all is well again in the world. Again, for anyone offended, I’m sorry for being insensitive enough to offend you, a perfect stranger. Anyway, go Broncs.”

Local CEO dragged kicking and screaming onto Tiger flight

A senior executive at an bespoke South Betoota private asset management firm has confirmed that he was left bloodied and beaten after being dragged onto a Tiger Airlines flight this afternoon.

Walter Huntington-Donoghue, a group CEO at Jocelyn & Connor, planned on departing Remienko Regional Airport this afternoon aboard a Qantas flight to Brisbane but was bumped from his domestic business class seat at the last minute due to a ticketing error.

The 55-year-old happily relinquished his seat to a visiting Qantas board member, with the impression that he’d be on the next flying kangaroo due to leave two hours later.

However, that flight was cancelled, leaving him no other option than to fly Tiger, which was the last plane due to leave Betoota. The meeting he was due to attend this afternoon in Brisbane was “make or break” for the firm, according to industry insiders.

“I outright refused,” he said.

“I’m not about to ride on this glorified bogan missile all the way to Brisbane, I simply refused. But my bosses forced me, physically.”

Captured on mobile phone cameras, Walter was placed in a headlock in the Tiger terminal and punched a number of times by a team of junior portfolio managers from Jocelyn & Connor as he was dragged against his will onto the Airbus.

The flight ultimately left without him, as he was rushed to Betoota Base Hospital after suffering a suspected cardiac episode.

A local stand-up comedian has taken time out of his hectic morning routine to visit his Belvwah Road solicitor to write his last will and testament ahead of his show tonight at Betoota Workies.

Former Instagram sensation turned actual comic Brett Powell revealed to The Advocate that he’s debuting a controversial new bit tonight on [REMOVED] – a traditionally dangerous topic for white, middle-class comedians to lampoon where even mentioning it by name can get you into trouble.

“I’m just going the responsible thing,” he said.

“Though my estate isn’t as impressive as other entertainers such as Peter Stefanovic and Jimoen, I have a number of assets that I don’t want my family and friends to squabble over should I be [REMOVED] in the street by some [REMOVED] after doing this bit tonight.”

The comic revealed a number of details about his estate to the media in an effort to set the document in concrete.

To his mother Daphne, he’s leaving the keys to his 1998 Hyundai Excel GLX and all its contents – which include a cricket kit and half a bottle of Coca-Cola.

His brother is set to receive Mr Powell’s vast collection of off-the-rack suits and slip on shoes. Most of those were controversially sourced during his tenure as an undertaker’s assistant at the South Betoota Crematorium. He was caught undressing corpses and taking the burial suits home with him.

“He was getting a bit big for his boots,” said fellow WhatsApp group member, Sam Peterman.

While the punishment for insolence isn’t as bad as being dragged out of bed in the middle of the night and shot with a Soviet-era 30mm anti-aircraft cannon, the manner in which Dollarhyde runs the group chat has been compared to North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un.

However, Mark dismissed those claims, explaining that he’s always been democratic and fair when punishing group members for their trespasses.

A local woman wearing a Julia Stone-style floppy felt hat, is ready to ‘do Melbourne’ – it has been confirmed.

After spending two months in Europe just over eighteen months ago, Dana Ringelstein (22) says she can’t bare the thought of spending another year in her ‘small little hometown’ of one million people.

However, despite her outspoken love of ‘Melbourne culture’ and Courtney Barnett – it appears that Dana is not 100% committed to the move, just yet.

The 22-year-old media graduate says that she’s just ‘applying for jobs down there at the moment’ – from the comfort of her childhood bedroom in her parent’s home – over 1000 kilometres away from her dream terrace house in Fitzroy.

Dana’s dad, Roy says he’s very supportive of his daughter’s decision to move down south and soak in some culture, however, he doesn’t think applying for mid-to-high level marketing jobs online is the first step to changing cities.

“She’s probably going to have to save a bit of money and work cash jobs in bars before she really finds a proper gig” says Roy.

“She just seems to think everyone in Melbourne is on 100k a year for doing nothing but hang out in graffiti-covered alleyways drinking coffee all day”

“She’d probably have been able to buy a bus fare down there if she didn’t buy that fucking hat for $350 dollars”

Dana says her dad doesn’t understand how it works these days.

“I just need to get a job first. The whole moving and finding a house thing can come later”

“Melbourne is way more chilled like that”

“It’s a bit like Berlin… Which is why I’m moving there. It was either Melbourne or Berlin”

Following his dreams into tax accountancy, a fresh university graduate from East Betoota started his first job this morning at J & R Sons Chartered Accountants on Darro Street.

Blake Condell was shown to his cubical by the office manager, who said the boss would be along shortly to greet and welcome him personally.

“I’m happy as a pig in shit,” said the 23-year-old.

“Can’t wait to get a start, really crunch some numbers and save our clients from the jaws of the Taxation Office. It will be a serious pissa.”

However, Mr Condell is yet to realise that as a rural tax specialist, this is as good as it’s going to get – in terms of a workspace.

Unbeknown to the hapless Libra, he will be sitting in a cubical with a computer in front of him until he’s hospitalised at age 69 with chest pains in the year 2063, where he will die a short time later.

“That’s an accurate assessment of what he can expect from life,” said J & R Sons senior partner Mike Wolsoley.

“While he’ll probably marry up in the next ten years, squeeze a few kids out between stints and night school and what not. Then he’ll just enjoy three to four decades of the same thing every day.

Baby Boomer hoping war with North Korea might toughen the Millennials up a bit

TEXT:

Speaking candidly to The Advocate this morning from the front verandah of his South Betoota Queenslander, local septuagenarian Keelan Butterick said that he welcomes a possible nuclear war with the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea as he hopes it’ll toughen the kids up a bit.

Just like the war the Vietnam did for his generation, an armed conflict with re-introduced conscription and national service would see the youth of the nation harden up and develop the courage to face the world and all its challenges.

“No, I didn’t go to Vietnam. But that’s beside the point,” said the 71-year-old retired property investor.

“The point is that with all the Poke-e-mans and premarital intercourse these kids are having these days, they’ve gone soft. They whinge all the time and complain about things. Well, I reckon sending them up to grease a few Korean teenagers might do the trick. Put a bit of fire in their gluten-free bellies!”

However, Keelan’s son Rex, 21, has other ideas.

Explaining to The Advocate that while he didn’t really have the desire to pop the heads of impoverished Korean rock farmers this year, he does agree that the United States needs to be tougher on the rogue state.

“I mean, can’t we just put embargoes on them or something? All-out nuclear war is a bit full on, don’t you think?” asked Rex.

“But you know, if I had to, I wouldn’t mind plugging a few. It’d make for some pissa yarns when we got back. But yeah, avoiding war would be good. However, if I did get atomised by a nuclear explosion, I’d remove a lot of stresses from my life, such as home ownership and my HECS debt.”

Jeff From The Wiggles Falls Asleep Behind The Wheel Of Big Red Car

The incident took place in the affluent Sydney suburb of Mosman earlier today, as the red four-wheeled-drive vehicle ran off the road and into a keep left sign.

Emergency respondents were heard yelling ‘Wake Up Jeff!’ when arriving to find the billionaire children’s entertainer still asleep with the motor running.

The 63-year-old founding member of the most successful Australian music group of all time has been urged by family and friends to finally do something about his well-known narcolepsy diagnosis.

Narcolepsy, a long-term neurological disorder that involves a decreased ability to regulate sleep-wake cycles, includes symptoms of excessive daytime sleepiness that usually last from seconds to minutes and may occur at any time – it is believed that Jeff Fatt has been criticised for showing negligence towards his treatment of debilitating illness since retiring from the stage.

Throughout the late 1980s through to 2000s, the condition gave way to Mr. Fatt’s iconic Wiggles schtick of sleeping at odd times, which led to a Wiggles’ catch-phrase and the title of one of their songs, “Wake Up, Jeff!”.

With the brand new Range Rover left on the scene, Mr Fatt made everyone promise not to tell his family that he’d dozed off again

“I’m all okay!” he told media on the scene, while stepping into the backseat of a limousine.

“I guess this kind of stuff just happens”

Best Man Knows Where The Line Is But Crosses It Anyway During Speech

TEXT:

After being asked repeatedly not to say anything too raucous, a South Betoota tiler has brought the house down at the Daroo Street Function Centre last night after roasting the groom and best friend with hilarious, but completely inappropriate anecdotes and stories.

Sam Pietersen agreed to be John Millers’ best man immediately, but was warned then and there that he had to be on his best behaviour.

“He [John] said I could speak about things that even his grandmother wouldn’t find offensive. That was the brief I got,” said Pietersen.

“But fuck that. I roasted them both and it was a serious pissa. Every cunt in the place had tears rolling down their face. Everybody except for the bride and her family, well except her brother, he’s a fucking mad man.”

Taking the microphone from the MC, the 29-year-old could barely wipe the smile off his face as he started to warm the reception up with a few choice stories from their days in high school.

“I told them the yarn about him and Sally Atwood, from the fourth form blue light at the PCYC. That’s pretty PG,” he said.

“He basically threw up on ol’ Sal when they retired out the fire escape and found themselves in the bushes. That was a funny night, hey Johnny.”

However, things took a turn for the worst when he revealed that during a football trip to the Gold Coast in 20011, just weeks before he met the woman he married yesterday, he contracted chlamydia and ended up giving it to his now wife.

“Fuck, so get this right. John gave her the clam accidently, like he didn’t cheat or anything, but rather than tell her, he just spiked her Milo with the antibiotics. Fuck we laughed about it.”

Mr Pietersen was then asked to sit down by the bridal party and the father of the bride said that the day he gets told he’s terminal, he’s taking Sam with him.

Local Girl Locks New Fling In For Winter With Arguably Premature Couple Shot

TEXT:

Local woman, Anna Pirie (27) has taken a huge gamble in uploading a captionless selfie with the new bloke she’s been seeing, well before anyone knows if this is going to be a sure thing.

The bloke in question, who is commonly known as ‘Donger’ to his close mates, says the Instagram post was a huge call from Anna.

“Mate, it’s either her being too eager or it’s some sort of hectic power play” said the 30-year-old former pantsman.

“My phone’s been running hot with mutual friends wondering if it’s as serious as the photo would suggest”

“Too be honest, I was kind of getting a bit bored of this thing, but it looks like I’m locked in for winter now”

Anna’s close friend Bridgette says she’s not sure what’s going on.

“Anna would be the first to fire off screenshots in the group chat if someone else had done something this reckless” she said.

“I guess she just wants to lock him in. The photo in itself was quite vague, like they were in a car park or something… Which makes it look even more serious”

“She’d wanna hope he doesn’t do a runner… That’d be a reallllly bad look”

Anna says it’s nothing and they are just friends and oh my God what do you think she meant by posting this.

Local grazier suitably unimpressed with Melbourne during his first visit

TEXT:

Thinking that he’d had enough to toil with since his last holiday over Christmas, Jennean Pallister though her husband Michael would enjoy a short 8-day retreat to Melbourne.

However, Mrs Pallister was wrong.

While Micheal is the devoted South Park fan in all of Lightning Ridge, he told The Advocate this afternoon that he’d like to see The Book of Mormon at some point – but he’d draw the line at travelling to Melbourne.

“Yeah look, when Jen said she’d booked us to go to Melbourne, I was a bit apprehensive,” he said.

“I’d never been there before and I didn’t really have any desire to go, you know? Not my place, Melbourne. Anyway, we’ve had about 550 points this year, bit below average but the place’ll take about a week or two the dry out after this last lot, so I thought ‘fuck it,’ might as well go before I end up in the ground.”

And go he did.

Making the short drive from the Ridge to Brisbane, the 59-year-old and his ageless partner flew down to the Yarra capital in the front of a Qantas Boeing, enjoying an executive smorgasbord of tired cheeses and sparkling white.

Arriving in Melbourne on Monday, the pair took in some of the sights Melbourne has to offer.

“You should’ve seen the cunts down there,” said Michael.

“The first morning, we had some gender-bender bloke covered in jewellery and facial piercings make us coffee. Charged us $9 for two long blacks, I mean come the fuck on, Bridget. I know I’m old and dumb, but fuck-me-roan. The Book or Morman, was an absolute pissa, though Bruce.”

“I could’ve waited until it got to Brisbane, but. These Victorians have some odd accent that makes it difficult to understand at times. Also, be sure to put some coins on the tram tracks and squash them. They’re my favourite souvenirs from my time in Victoria. Never again, but.”

Bloke forgot to close whatever website he was looking at before bed

TEXT:

Rocking up ten minutes late to his first lecture, a Betoota TAFE student has totally embarrassed himself by opening his laptop, revealing that he forget to close a pornographic website he was looking at last night before bed.

Khi Westmacott, 21, punked himself this morning during his horticulture theory class and scrambled to close the inappropriate window before anybody noticed.

However, many classmates seated behind the simple legend quickly recognised the infamous black, white and burnt orange colour scheme of US pornographic website, PornHub.

“Ohhhh nooooo!” said Kai.

“I bet everybody saw what I was looking at! God this is soo embarrassing. I’m glad it was quite vanilla, sometimes I can get a bit full-on in my porn tastes. Nothing illegal, just like a bit of MMF or some uncensored Japanese stuff. You guys know what I’m talking about, right?”

Speaking candidly to The Advocate about what she saw when Westmacott opened his computer this morning, classmate Sylvia Pearson said her opinion of Kai changed instantly.

While Kai seems to think the content of his last video he watched last night was quite innocent, Ms Pearson has another opinion.

“Yeah, so it was basically what you’d call a Turkish Drill Press, but in the back of a London Black Cab. It was quite confronting to see that at 8 o’clock in the morning,” she said.

“I didn’t think Kai was into that type of thing.”

Rollie Smoker Can’t Believe He’s Being Taxed The Same As Filthy Pre-Rolled Smokers

TEXT:

Caught between a credit card and a hard place, a West Betootan road worker spent much of the afternoon fishing through his ashtray looking for something vaguely smokable – all the while wondering if he’s above smoking dumpers.

Today’s announcement of an increase in taxes on both pre-rolled and roll-your-own cigarettes has made this decision a lot easier.

“Fucking great”

Greg Pellet turned 39 in January, but strangers often mistake him for being much older

“It’s because of my love the durry. I am a slave to the durry,” he said, speaking to The Advocate while he inspected each one of his housemate’s discarded cigarette butts.

“I don’t need this stress. I’m not one of those gross pre-rolled smokers”

“But you see, I don’t get paid until next Thursday and I’ve gone and pissed all my money up against the wall. I’m already getting by on half a meat pie each day, you’d be fucked if I can make room for some smicks in my budget, especially at the price they are now.”

While Pellet confided in The Advocate that personally, he knew he wasn’t above smoking dumpers, he didn’t want anyone else to know that he’d stoop that low as a grown man with a full-time job.

However, we can report that rather than wrap his lips around some sickly old ciggie butt, he collected about a dozen smoked durries, peeled the virgin tobacco out of each one and rolled himself a racehorse with bible paper.

Waiter shoves customer’s leftovers into mouth before reaching the kitchen

TEXT:

As the cost of living in leafy East Betoota continues to grow, some of the town’s most vulnerable workers are beginning to feel the pinch.

After signing an enterprise agreement with his employer, local waiter Jackson Stumpman said his regular hourly and penalty rates were replaced by a flat, above award rate.

However, his hours were cut back dramatically at Le Pisse Dans Ma Poche in Betoota’s Old City French Quarter after signing the document, meaning he’s no longer taking home a livable wage – his story is not dissimilar to other Betootanese people living slightly above the poverty line.

But a silver lining has emerged through the storms of financial peril.

The 24-year-old revealed to The Advocate that now that he can barely afford to feed himself these days, he takes pleasure devoid of guilt in devouring food left on the plate between the table and the kitchen.

“Yeah, guilty,” he said.

“In the corridor between the dining room and the kitchen, I take whatever is on the plate and shove it into my mouth. The chefs hate it and blow up at us if they catch us hoovering up a bit of half-chewed filet mignon. But you’ve gotta do what you’ve gotta do, I guess.”

The Advocate approached Le Pisse Dans Ma Poche for comment but have yet to receive a reply.

New Balance Sneakers Add Modern Flair To Indian Grandmother’s Traditional Saree

TEXT:

A Parramatta grandmother’s bold choice of sports shoe footwear is contrasting wonderfully with her traditional Indian saree, it has been confirmed by her grandchildren this afternoon.

While many of Indria Kumar’s grandchildren are secretly amused by her decision to seek flexible arch support that provide greater balance and comfort in the shoe – the 88-year-old matriarch is yet to acknowledge her revolutionary fusion of cultures.

A saree (also known as a sari, or shari)  is a female garment from the Indian subcontinent that consists of a drape varying from five to nine yards (4.5 metres to 8 metres) in length – and two to four feet (60 cm to 1.20 m) in breadth. It is typically wrapped around the waist, with one end draped over the shoulder, baring the midriff.

However, after several generations down under, the Indian-Australian’s take on the saree has been given a stylish new flair.

Rocking the New Balance sneaker under the saree has become increasingly popular for Indian-Australian aunties and grandmother’s in recent years, as the ageing population of first wave migrants turn to modern Australian techniques of dealing with lino floors and heavily concreted urban areas.

The New Balance/ Saree combo is also believed to help with performance in the kitchen as the maternal Indian-Australians refuse to stop cooking for an array of family members who could be visiting at any time.

Mrs Kumar’s grandson, Ravi, says she’s lived a long and challenging life, and if treating herself to the luxury of blended gel inserts, heel counters and a comfortable range of widths is something she feels up to, then good on her.

“I don’t think it’s nearly as bad as some of the outfits I see getting around University” he says.

“I’m worried if some of these art students saw my grandmother rocking the saree and sneaker combo they’d be wearing the same thing next week”

Local leftie wants to #bringthemhere only if ‘here’ isn’t his gentrified suburb

TEXT:

Sighing loudly enough for half the wine bar to hear, a local Greens voter took a moment to reflect on the government’s unjust immigration policy as he stared out the window, fighting back tears.

“It’s disgusting,” said Urshela Leaf, 36, of South Betoota’s famed Greenpoint Artists’ Commune.

“They’re imprisoning children, they’re committing crimes against humanity. Peter Dutton should be locked up at The Hague with the likes of Slobodan Milosevic and Ratko Mladic. We need to bring those people in offshore detention here. Right now.”

Mr Leaf took time today out of his busy schedule to talk to The Advocate at the trendy wine bar, The Angry Cassowary, in the leafy yet socially exclusive suburb of Greenpoint, South Betoota.

The taxpayer-subsidised performance artist was quite upset throughout the interview, often taking his time to pause and pensively answer each question as if it were being asked by Michael Usher on national television.

However, Leaf’s tune changed when the suggestion that perhaps some of the refugees and asylum seekers could find a home in his neighbourhood.

“Two things are wrong with that idea,” he said.

“We don’t have many ethnic minorities in Betoota, it would be cruel to send, for example, a family of Muslim Bangladeshis out here when there’s a perfectly good existing community for them on the fringes of capital cities around the country,”

“I’m not saying that they shouldn’t come here, that would be something my Dad, who I hate, would say. I’m saying that they’d like it better if they lived around their own type. I mean people. Don’t print that. I mean they should go where they’re happiest, which is obviously around their family and friends. That sounds better.”

Local African Bloke Wearing A Shirt That Could Blind Ya

TEXT:

The typical Australian grandfather’s Christmas Day outfit has nothing on a local African bloke’s flash new button up, it has been confirmed.

The South-Betoota man by the name of Lou has received praise from the local community today for bringing back the loud button up. A style once made popular by drovers visiting town for the rodeo.

The father-of-three says this particular lime green number is one of his favourites, and he’s surprised that locals think he needs a reason to wear a such a lively shirt.

This isn’t the first time the cheerful Kenyan-born kitchenhand has drawn attention for his vibrant fashion sense, just last month he was seen rocking an off-pink business shirt with a Cadbury-purple double windsor necktie during a family get together at the Lord Kidman hotel.

Retired local farmer, Ken Pearson (80) says that he loves seeing a bloke bold enough “to rock a shirt that could blind ya”.

“We need more of it.” he says.

“Back in my day, you’d measure a man by how loud his shirt was… All my grandkids are getting around town in basketball jerseys… Lou’s the only one that knows what a real lid looks like”

All three of Lou’s children were also seen wearing Australian sporting merchandise, while his wife was rocking the high-waisted stretch jeans and mid-drift, with bright blue lipstick.

Make-A-Wish Foundation grant dying cabbie last wish to run over a cyclist

TEXT:

If there’s one thing Mark McLaughlin enjoys less than somebody vomiting in the back seat of his taxi cab, it’s cyclists.

The 77-year-old was the first taxi license recipient in the greater Betoota district in 1965, where he was able to grow his business from just one car to ten in a matter of months.

He’s seen it all.

Retiring in 2011, McLaughlin cites the changing culture in town that’s drifting away from drinking a few beers after work to something much more sinister.

“The young men and women in town are spending much less time at the pub I’ve noticed,” he said.

“It’s my understanding that they do other things such as smoke rock or ride bicycles in order to keep fit between cricket and football season. Regardless, the cyclists have been a scourge on Betoota for countless years. It’s always been my dream to bounce one off the Ford badge and watch him disappear under the bumper.”

Next week, the former Betoota Sailing Club Commodore will get his wish.

After being diagnosed with an undisclosed terminal illness, Mark has been granted his final wish by the Make-A-Wish Foundation, who plan to source a pack of cyclists from the local prison.

“We will put crims on pushbikes and send them off down the road in a big pack,” said Make-A-Wish spokesman, Geoff Morrison.

“Then we’ll put Mark on the beaded seat of his old cab and let him hoon off after them. He’s a local treasure and deserves this.”

Local Lo-Fi band sells out and goes Hi-Fi

TEXT:

The third-most prolific shoegaze band in Betoota has shunned their lo-fi sound ahead of the release of their first album next month, citing that they actually have some “pretty good lyrics” and people deserve to hear them.

Quran Quran Renault Megane burst onto the East Betoota music scene in 1993, with local chart topping singles such as Kaleidoscope Colonoscopy and Bucket Bong Time Machine – that latter of which garnered personal acclaim from Molly Meldrum.

However, for the long-awaited debut album, the vaporwave-cum-shoegaze quartet has revealed they’ve recorded their new songs in Hi-Fi down in Brisbane.

“I just think it was time,” said drummer Leeroy Bathplug, 34, known locally for changing his name to Leeroy Bathplug at age 18. “Connor’s writing has been next level. Our listeners deserve to hear it.”

Bathplug’s sentiments were echoed by bassist and occasional keyboardist Graham Nerada, 57, who said that Connor’s lyrics have entered another dimension.

“Yeah man,” he said. “He went on this backpacker slash fruit-picking odyssey through regional Victoria and really found himself. The proof is in the pudding man, it’s some real etch, but tight shit. Fuck Pitchfork!”

However, lead singer and songwriter Connor Duskcrunch said he doesn’t really remember what happened in regional Victoria, but whatever happened was magical.

“Our manager, Reggie Maddan, really helped us out on this one,” said Connor. “He got us through it all, helped put the record together and got us dinner with the drummer from Powderfinger. It was him who said that lo-fi is out and that I sing like Bernie and the punter should hear it.”

Quran Quran Renault Megane’s first album entitled Emergency Brake Heartache will be made available on Spotify on May 6 with physical copies hitting shelves a week after.

Baby Boomer still thinks it was better in his day despite recent heart-lung transplant

As a part of his ongoing rehabilitation, recent double-transplant recipient Dennis Sparklemein had told everybody from his medical team to his young adult children that he still thinks life as better in his heyday.

The 69-year-old revealed to The Advocate that he his generation had real things to worry about such as communism, AIDS and Catholic people – ‘poisonous’ aspects of society that today’s generation doesn’t have to worry about thanks to the sacrifices made by the Baby Boomers.

However, thanks to the advancements in medical science and an unlucky motor cyclist, the South Betoota property investor has a new lease on life after treating his old organs to a daily pack of Peter Stuyvesants and a wheel of double brie.

“I know that if I needed the operation back in the 70s, they would’ve just laughed and told the crematorium to warm the oven up, but life was just so much better back then,” he said.

“Now that I’m old and fucked, my hand and fingers crack when I open a jar even. But yeah, I’m thankful and all for the organs but that won’t change my mind of when life was better in the country.”

However, some of his children his agree with their old man.

“I could literally smell home ownership,” said son Tom, 28, a local advertising executive. “When the doctors said they needed a miracle, I figured he’d be dead within a week. The old bastard’s worth like 10 or 20 big ones.”

“House prices in Betoota are only going one-way. This desalination plant has fucked the town up with their high salaries and unskilled workforce. Life sucks for young people right now.”

“Not to mention the googs!”

CSIRO launches study into why men spit in the urinal

TEXT:

Men are often criticized for not being able to do two things at once, however, most men are able to urinate and spit at the same time – which has become an area of interest for Australia’s peak scientific body.

Launching a $455m study into why men spit in the urinal before they start pissing has been a passion project for CSIRO researcher Sarah Turner for over a decade.

“I’m excited to finally get to the bottom of this phenomenon,” she said.

“Look, it’s always been an area of interest for me. Men are often labeled as being oafish and simple, but after learning that boys all around the country are able to spit and piss at the same time, I knew I had to find out why.”

In addition to the original study, Turner has been allotted a further $65m to investigate why men enjoying pissing on urinal pucks – when when they know it’ll splash back onto them and whoever else is standing at the trough.

Remote Murri Kid Not Good Enough At Footy To Go To Secondary School

TEXT:

Despite his love of learning, local Murri kid, Jason Ridley (7) has today come to terms with the fact that he probably won’t be finishing year twelve.

As a young Aboriginal male with a fair bit of pace, everything was looking good for Jason, until he became old enough to play full contact football.

“I just don’t have the ball skills to keep moving forward and avoid getting tackled at the same time” he said, disappointedly.

“I thought I was going to be one of the kids who get to go to a private school and make a bunch of old stockbrokers proud to see their sons winning schoolboy premierships”

“But I’m just not good enough for a scholarship”

Unfortunately for Jason, this means his schooling will likely end upon the conclusion of grade ten, as the closest public high school is over 100km away. That’s providing he doesn’t enter the prison system before that.

“Look, he’s no Kurtley” says one private school scout.

“Put it this way. Parents wouldn’t be happy with this kid getting a call up over the son of a third-generation fee-payer”

Jason, who doesn’t even really like football, knows for a fact the only way out of poverty is to be really good at sport.

“I thought, even if I’m not the best player in my family, at least I’d be better than most of the white kids in the city”

“But it turns out I’m really bad” he says.

“Like, worse than the white boys”

With his local footy team already drafting team lists that don’t have his name on it, Jason has resigned to the fact that he’ll probably end up going to juvie for a petty crime born out of severe boredom and removed sense of self-agency.

“Oh well… I hear some of these juvies have school in them” he says, trying to remain positive.

“Maybe I’ll be finally able to learn about history”

“I’d love to read more about my peoples history in the schoolbooks”

Young Sikh Man Looking Forward To Another Year Of Being Racially Profiled At Airports And Other Public Buildings

Despite putting a Union Jack filter over his Facebook display picture, a local Sikh man has no grand illusions about how he’s going to be treated at airports and other public buildings in the wake of yet another terrorist attack linked to Islam.

Ranjit Bahadur has been the head of the Betoota Chamber of Commerce since 2008 and often travels interstate and overseas on business – taking the wider produce and riches of the wider Diamantina region to the world.

However, he’s noted that each time the globe descends into chaos, his travel plans often find a spanner in their works.

“Yeah look, mate. Last time I went to the US to spruik our Betoota Busy-Bee Honey, they woo-ed me up at LAX and put the hard word on me,” he said.

“I don’t blame them, I guess to the untrained eye I look a bit like an Afghani peasant farmer in a $7000 Hugo Boss suit. But yeah, even though I know I’m cool and I’ll get through eventually, I know that they’re going to pull me aside and go through me with a nit comb.”

The 34-year-old former South Betoota High opening batsman then revealed that he’s due to leave on a two-week business trip to Europe tomorrow, selling Brahman hump to the curious.

“We’ll see how this one goes,” he said.

Rural Bachelor Throws On The Seductive Ankle-Flappers For A Night Out In The Big Smoke

TEXT:

Ruining yet another pair of stonewash boot cut jeans, a quiet but equally endearing Eromanga man makes no apologies for the fashion faux pas – saying, “it is what it is, then you die.”

Speaking to The Advocate this morning from the heart, Gregor Norfolk said that his mother often forgets that he’s not as tall has his father or his brothers when she buys him jeans, resulting in him walking on the heel of the jean.

“Call them what you want. Scalloped shin swingers, heel chewers, heel flappers. I don’t really care. A jean is a jean, mate. Most of the jeans I get are hand-me-downs, anyway,” he said.

“I’ll walk the heels out of the lot of ’em. Does it look like I give a fuck? I can still lay pipe like Bob the Builder, I can go all fucking night mate.”

The 29-year-old part-time pastoralist explained slowly to our reporters that only sissy men and perverts cared about what people wore out, going to outline that his 70 000-acre often trumps any fashion faux pas he might entertain.

However, Mr Norfolk is just one man in a growing movement among young country men to walk the heel out of a nice pair of jeans.

In 2015, a Walgett man was denied entry to an exclusive Sydney nightspot for attempting to enter wearing filthy pleather loafers and a pair of heel chewers.

A local dual citizen threw his British passport in the rubbish this morning after all hope that ‘Brexit’ wasn’t actually going to go ahead was extinguished as UK Prime Minister Theresa May plans to officially notify the European Union next Wednesday that the kingdom is leaving.

Cameron Rollandson spoke to The Advocate a short time ago, saying that he took advantage of his ability to receive a British passport after leaving high school – using it to holiday and work through Europe as a young man.

However, after the UK explained that they actually were leaving the EU, the 29-year-old said his burgundy passport isn’t even worth the paper it’s printed on.

“I enjoyed being British for 11 years, but yeah, not really interested in going back there to be honest,” said the semi-retired beekeeper.

“The only Australians who move to the UK to work are either dual citizens, people who get sent there for work at gunpoint and directionless, often broken-hearted 20-somethings from Brisbane looking for meaning and validation in life. I am not one of them, I sold my honey business to Capilano – now all I do it crush tins and travel the world hunting large game,”

“Last year, I went to Canada and shot a grizzly bear just so I could look at it up close without the danger of being slashed to death.”

The Betoota Dolphins season ticket holder then went on to say that he wasn’t alone – that many other Betootanese British citizens holders were also disposing of their passports irresponsibly.

“Mike from the pub, who’s actually a stinky pom, said he wasn’t going home [laughs] chucked his passport in the bin. That sucked mango seed Peter Dutton probably won’t let him, but.”

Local Italian Asks Real Estate Agent If He’ll Take Cash And Leave The ATO Out Of It

TEXT:

65 year old Italian immigrant Chris Marchese was left seething at the local real estate agent yesterday afternoon, after the salesman “refused to come to the party.”

The Betoota Real estate agent Ben Hunt, 30, looked flabbergasted when the prospective home buyer asked for 10 percent off the price of a home if he paid in cash.

“Ahhhh mate, that’s not really how it works. I can’t just chop 10 percent off the price, and you can’t buy this place with cash,” he explained to Marchese.

“Yes you can. I pay kessh (cash),” said Marchese standing out the front of one of the homes in the new Betoota estate.

Marchese said that he tried to explain to this young “bloody idiot” that it works better for everyone if he pays cash.

“Brother, if I pay kessh, you save money, I save money, everyone saves money. Otherwise we are just donating our hard earned to the government, you understand huh?” he said to Hunt.

The builder from Sydney told the Advocate that the whole economy is “fucked” now, and that he had to reluctantly sign up for a bank account a few years ago.

“They tell ya we abolished slavery a hundred or so years ago, well nowadays we are enslaved to these bloody banks!” he said.

Marchese’s son Louis said that his dad tries to negotiate the 10 percent cash discount everywhere he goes.

“The local green grocer, the hardware shop, fuck me, he actually loves the Good Guys,” he said.

Hunt, who was too busy to speak to the Advocate in detail said “As the great Darryl Kerrigan from the Castle says “What is it with you wogs and Cash,” fuck me that’s a good movie actually.

“Anyway I’ve gotta go fellas, I’m flat out.”

Local bloke under fire for bringing a longneck of red wine to Sunday BBQ

TEXT:

Moving to the harsh Queensland interior just last year, a local retiree has revealed that his ‘sand-change’ was going swimmingly up until yesterday when he arrived at a mate’s Sunday BBQ with a longneck of red wine.

Red wine and other communist beverages were banned from the wider Betoota district after the 1954 Petrov Affair triggered hysteria throughout the Diamantina Shire.

That quirky by-law obviously wasn’t at the forefront of Michael Broadmoor’s mind when he arrived at Mayor Keith Carton’s bi-fortnightly Sunday BBQ with a bottle of Cockfighter’s Ghost Shiraz tucked under his arm.

“What’s that you’ve got there?” asked the Mayor.

“Oh, it’s just a bit of the good stuff, you know. Not Grange, but a nice Sunday wine. Cockfighter’s I think.” he replied.

“Fuck me dead, Mickey. You would be doing a lot of cock-fighting if you put that shit in your body. Here, having a fucking Betoota Bitter you big poof and let me introduce you to my nephew,” replied the Mayor.

Later in the day, Councillor Carton confident in The Advocate, saying that he was quite shocked and appalled by what Broadmoor did yesterday.

Wondering how in Christ’s name he was able to smuggle red wine into the desert is one thing, but the biggest worry that the Mayor had over the whole affair is just how flippant and wreckless the sand-changer was in bringing red wine over to his house.

“You know, just when you think you know somebody, they go and pull something like this,” he said.

“Just goes to show that the threat of communism is coming back.”

Bloke’s life unravels after being caught with pants around ankles at the urinal

TEXT:

A local alpaca farmer has confided in The Advocate this morning, explaining that his long road to ruin began after he was snapped in the men’s restroom of The Betoota Hotel using the urinal with his Wranglers wrapped around his ankles.

Caught with his pants down in the midst of a midsummer night’s drinking session with many of the other alpaca meat producers in the wider Betoota district, Graham ‘Goanna’ Gregory said that the images of him at the urinal have since gone viral – ruining his life.

“In my opinion, there’s nothing wrong with how I go to the bathroom,” he said.

“It’s not like it’s a big secret around town, either. It’s just what I do. But that tourist who snapped me in the john certainly got what was coming to him.”

After spending a week gallivanting around the Simpson Desert, the German national responsible for taking and distributing the images of the 34-year-old online was passing back through town on his way back to the soft country further east.

“We thought we’d never see him again,” said Gregory.

“Anyway, when he came into the pub that night, everybody looked at me as if to say, ‘What are you going to do Goanna? You just going to let him go?’ and I thought fuck him, so I went out to my Cruiser and came back with my 410 and put a spread up his back.”

Scenes inside then turned chaotic, on the count of somebody getting shot, which resulted in Gregory being arrested for trying to kill Lars Von Boulia, a 23-year-old backpacker from Stuttgart.

“Long story short, this German bloke dropped like bushel of bananas cut from a tree. Before I could reload and turn his head inside out, the copper tackled me and said I’d fucked up bad this time,” he said.

“Turns out we just had to wait until all the heat blew over. They let me go in the end, the cop didn’t even file the paperwork. Let that be a lesson to al of you.”

Sensible, smart and confident woman often told she must be fun at parties

TEXT:

Speaking candidly to The Advocate this afternoon, a resident student at Betoota Base Hospital has spoken about how she’s often told that she’d be fun at parties by men – for simply voicing an informed, but opposing opinion.

Rather than retreat into her shell, UQ graduate student Emma O’Donoghue says she was told from an early age that sticking up for what you believe in shouldn’t be met with ridicule.

“Honestly, the amount of times men have said that I’d be fun at parties… For nothing, for sanding slightly against the patriarchal grain of society,” said the 26-year-old.

“If being ‘fun’ at parties involves strawpedo-ing a carton of watermelon Cruisers and letting some footy boy ram his tongue down my throat then I don’t want to be ‘fun’ – sorry if that sounds blunt, but you know, it’s a fine line.”

However, Ms O’Donoghue isn’t the first young woman in town to face accusations of being a frigid fun0sucker.

Just last year, our local trainee librarian and CWA branch treasurer, Kate McGreentree, revealed that she was chastised for choosing not to take part in the Betoota Dolphins end-of-season celebrations after being leered at from the balcony of a local hotel.

“I was on the other side of the road and one of those goons asked me to come in for a drink… at 10am the morning after, they were still at it,” she told The Advocate in October.

“When I said I had to go to the library, go to work, they said I must me fun at parties while they gave me the forks. Ahhh yeah, thanks but no thanks.”

Oakleigh Almost Confused For Athens After Papou Installs Decorative Fibreglass Balustrades

TEXT:

After thirty years of renovating, local papou, Conrad Gerbouris (72) is finally content with his front porch.

The post-war migrant made a vow to his wife in 1986 that there would not be a blade of grass within the boundaries of their entire workers cottage by the time grandkids came along. Today he can proudly say that the job is done.

“These pillars, moit” he says.

“I picked them up from a bloke down the road with a garden shop. It’s not real concrete but it lasts longer anyway”

After installing 18 x 50 cm miniature Athenian-style fiberglass pillars along the front of his porch, Conrad says his place is looking arguably better than the real thing.

The ‘real thing’ he is talking about is ancient Greece.

The weathered grandfather of twenty-seven smiles as he blasts a high-powered garden hose onto his ‘front lawn’ – when asked why he dedicates so much time and water to this task, Mr Gerbouris simply responds “It’s the weekend, moit”.

Often referred to as ‘the Greek broom’ – the Southern-European practice of hosing down driveways has been a hot topic for local politicians for many years now, Conrad says you need to keep the place wet if you want it too look decent.

He says these pillars are bloody beautiful.

“Mate, it’s just like back home but better. This things don’t require the same upkeep”

“Back in the day I would have gone for all-concrete, but my backs getting weary and these bluddy kids of mine are too busy to help”

“They keep telling me to sell this shit and move to the suburbs. They reckon I could pull in over two million for a place like this”

“I can tell you it’ll be worth a lot fucking more now with these pillars’

Chemist Just Flat Out Selling Lollies

TEXT:

The South Betoota Pharmacy is blatantly selling lollies and chocolates, it has been confirmed.

Aside from the vaguely justifiable glucose jelly beans aimed at helping diabetics stabilize, local pharmacist Sparky Kennedy has also placed ‘low sugar’ licorice, caramels and chocolates and gummie treats at the check-out.

“It’s all either sugar-free or low-sugar” he says.

“Sometimes a big smile is the best medicine. And the best way to bring about a smile in young children is giving into their tantrums during a visit to the chemist”

This marketing ploy has resulted in waves of stressed parents, with fluey children hanging off their hips, being pressured into purchasing the furthest thing from medicine during a visit.

Local mum, Anna Berry (34), says she doesn’t know how she managed to get talked into buying a packet of chocolate bullets and another bag of fruity chews, but it seemed like it couldn’t have been that irresponsible because it was sold to her by a trained medical professional.

Local Creep Reads A Book At The Pub

TEXT:

Taking advantage of a rare Sunday afternoon off work, a local creep grabbed a paperback Michael Crichton and headed on down to the Betoota Hotel for some one-on-one time with himself.

Colin Denuto told The Advocate this afternoon that it’s one of his favourite things to do – to go to the pub by himself and read.

“My house can get a bit noisy so I enjoy coming down here for a bit of peace,” said the 36-year-old.

“People often look at me like I’m crazy, you know. Coming down to the pub by yourself is kind of weird as it is. But to come here and read, that’s what freaks people out.”

Echoing the local creep’s sentiments was bar manager Jock Campbell, who agrees that statement that whenever he see’s Denuto coming down the footpath with a book under his arm on the way to the pub, he dies a little bit inside.

“Mate, it’s a bit antisocial, don’t you think?” said Jock.

“People typically come down here to have a bit of fun, shoot some pool or spin a couple wild ringing yarns, that’s about it. But Col just reads? Why can’t he just be like everyone else?”

Mildly Popular High School Kid Claims To Have Lost Virginity To A Girl From The Coast

TEXT:

With a new batch of potentially cool kids coming through the ranks in his year nine cohort, run-of-the-mill high school student, Haydon Comino (15) has relaunched himself back into the fray, with a vague story about losing his virginity to a girl who goes to another school in another town.

The fact that the girl that Haydon allegedly ‘did it with’ is not known to any of his schoolmates has raised a few questions amongst his female peers

However, his graphic description of ‘how it went down’ has excited his male classmates to the point where no one wants to believe it isn’t true.

“You guys wouldn’t know her. She’s from the coast” he says nonchalantly.

“I met her when I was down there last weekend with my family. She had a house to herself”

“It was no big deal. Apparently chicks on the coast always do that kind of thing”

Haydon’s confidence in relaying this story has resulted in further exaggeration throughout the school halls. Something that he is not too concerned about.

Jeremy, a less-popular male student, says Haydon is nothing short of a legend – after learning about his 45 minute blowjob which turned into full on sex, with a 69 as well.

“The girls at our school are so frigid. I definitely want to go to the coast for New Years”

Taking his news from a wide variety of sources, the 41-year-old North Betoota diesel fitter quickly comes to an informed conclusion, which he promptly shares with his 117 Facebook friends.

Highlights from this year include a status swollen with 17 likes, which explained the correlation between the spike in Islamic terrorism in the country and the spike in Islamic immigrants.

“Man Monis, and that other dog who shot that poor bloke in Parramatta? Yeah, tell me that would’ve happened in 1996. No way, mate. Australian’s [sic] need to band together in order to survive this onslaught. This is only the beginning.” he wrote.

Another ominous note the spicy Sagittarius left for his followers made it clear how much influence Israel has over the world economy and what steps the nation can take to remove it.

While admitting that his statements are provocative and raw, Nicols makes no apologies.

“Yeah what, I don’t have a filter. Deal with it,” he said.

“I speak my mind and I speak truth. The best person to lead you through the dark times is a blindman, the best person to lead you through the mad times is a madman.”

After 60 Years In Australia, Nonno Is Finally Confident Enough To Say Fuck Off We’re Full

TEXT:

Elderly Italian-Australian, Dominic Ambrosini (72) is completely fine with securing the country’s borders from anymore immigrants, it has been confirmed.

The retired barbershop owner from Betoota’s recently gentrified East End has many reasons for his seemingly irrational xenophobia, most of which are which are a result of long-held prejudices that have followed him from his home country.

“The Syrians. No good” he says.

“You can’t trust a Syrian”

“Australia should say no. No more”

After being pressed on his anti-Syrian sentiments, it seems Mr Ambrosini is talking about the fact that Syria was an early Roman province, annexed to the Roman Republic in 64 BC by Pompey in the Third Mithridatic War, following the defeat of Armenian King Tigranes the Great.

With his Greens-voting barista grandson Anthony attempting to challenge his hypocritical attitude towards immigration policy, Mr Ambrosini says he knows nothing.

“You know nothing” he says.

“We built this country. You never work an honest day in your life”

While initially a staunch Labor-voter after his time working on the Snowy Mountains Scheme, Mr Ambrosini says he started to steer towards the Liberal party after starting his own business and making some money.

“I like Tony Abbot more. He’s tough on the boat people” he says, ignoring the fact that he was considered a boat person when he arrived here with no documents in the 1950s.

WIKILEAKS: Man With Tape Over His Laptop Webcam Not Looking So Crazy Anymore

TEXT:

After news broke earlier today regarding the extent that the Central Intelligence Agency [CIA] was surveilling ordinary people, a local man formerly chastised for taping up his webcam has now been vindicated.

Activist agency WikiLeaks released a swathe of leaked documents this morning which detailed just how much control government spy agencies have over the population, with many voicing their outrage.

Local IT business owner Graham Doherty put a strip of opaque tape over the webcam of his late model Macintosh laptop to protect his privacy.

“Seeing me naked should be punishment enough for breaching my privacy,” laughed the 34-year-old.

“But in all seriousness, everybody thought I was crazy. I don’t have anything to hide, but then why a house have blinds? For privacy. But yeah, the government probably knows everything from my taste in porn to my weekly meeting schedule. I don’t care, but they shouldn’t know that much about me.”

In response to the leaks, which explained that the CIA can hack everything from your phone to your car, the spy agency has remained characteristically silent.

However, one insider has said that the keyword in this whole fiasco is ‘can’.

Speaking to the media via WikiLeaks, the insider said that just because the government can spy on you if you’re using popular messaging services and devices such as iPhones and WhatsApp – doesn’t mean they are.

“They only care about you if you’re being naughty. If you’re a tax accountant who sometimes likes to spend a night watching trap porn and shitposting, then you’ve only let down your parents, not your government.”

Local bloke still gets off by sticking his Hubba Bubba under tables

TEXT:

If you’ve run your hand under any restaurant, pub or club table around town and felt a small crop chewing gums stuck to the underside, chances are it was put there by Elliot ‘Stagecoach’ Cunningham.

For the past 20 years, the Dolphins hooker has terrorised publicans and restaurateurs with his discarded bubble gum wrappers and chewed goblets scattered and stuck under their tables.

Earlier today, the confirmed omnivore spoke candidly to The Advocate about how he gets off by being the sole Hubba Bubba aficionado left in Betoota.

“Most of the chewing and bubble gum you see in the big smoke is stuck on the footpath,” he said.

“I don’t do that, that’s disgusting. Sticking it under tables is the environmental option. That way, somebody has to take a paint scraper to the underside and put all the chewed gum into the rubbish. That’s how I get my bean strum, by helping the environment.”

However, not everybody around town has the same amount of praise Stagecoach Cunningham has for himself.

One quiet evening in April of last year, ambulance crews attended the Wu-Fuk Chinese All-You-Can -Eat on Morrison Street after reports emerged that a 26-year-old man had been booted across the head.

A Wu-Fuk manager had just witnessed Elliot take a sickly blob of watermelon flavoured bubble gum out of his mouth and stick it under the table.

“He kicked me so hard across the face, the stitching in the ugg boot he was wearing left a bruise up the side of my head,” he said. “I took him to court and won.”

In the ensuing ambulance ride, Stagecoach’s heart stopped twice and his retinas detached. The kick also perforated one of his ear drums.

“Had I known Jackie fucking Chan was working there, I would’ve been more discreet!”

James Nerada was able to convince himself moments before asking to be handed the child that if he did share some candid pics of him with the bub that his female followers, who currently don’t think much of him romantically, might begin to look at him in a different light.

“I’m not getting any younger,” said the 20-year-old. “I need to start thinking about my future. What I want to do with my life, who I want to do it with and where I want to be. It’s scary, but I’m ready to put my party boy reputation to bed!”

“I think that if I post some cute pics of me with a baby, I’ll get a stack of likes for starters and all the girls who follow me might think of me differently. I’m ready.”

However, not everybody is convinced.

A close pal of James’ reckons that the platonic females friends he’s trying to impress will see straight through his charade.

“Mate, he had his stomach pumped last week. Does he think we’re dumb? A few happy snaps of him and some fatherless bastard won’t change that,” he said.

“Perhaps if he took the time to properly launder his clothes, clean up his appearance and stop saying like the most racist things you’d hear this side of the Warrego – then maybe thing would improve for him.”

Woman with standing desk enjoys looking down on the seated peasants

TEXT:

Taking the moral high-ground by throwing her chair in a creek, a local public relations account director has taken to standing at her North Betoota desk – putting her wellbeing first before comfort.

The healthy choice has allowed Julianne Busbey to look down at those who still sit down and work like neanderthals, judging them silently as they slouch and hunch over their keyboards.

“Look at these cucks,” she said.

“Oprah said that sitting is the new smoking. I’ve heard Ellen is replacing her interview seats with interview standing decks. Don’t laugh at me, I’m on the right side of history. These peasants will be dead by the time they’re 70.”

While the vegan said she’s ‘eternally thankful’ for the boutique firm for supplying the standing desk, she was concerned with the tone that a male partner used when she first enquired about it.

“Paul [senior partner] just kinda laughed and rolled his eyes when I asked him for the standing desk, which was disgusting,” she said.

“Then he just said, ‘Yeah, no problem. I’ll have to order it up from IKEA down in Logan. Might take a while!’ then he just cackled and walked off. Unacceptable.”

Though The Advocate has an obligation to follow this developing story, the editorial department has expressed their disinterest in both the story and Ms Busbey.

Indian Cricket Board request another drop-in pitch from the back of Betoota

TEXT:

In an effort to maintain a level of consistency this Test series, the Indian Cricket Board (ICB) has made a formal request to the Diamantina Shire Council for another drop-in pitch from the back blocks of South West Betoota.

Late last year, the controlling entity of Indian cricket purchased two pitches from the E.H. Pearson Cattle Company for use in the upcoming Test series with Australia, with an option to buy another should the situation call for it.

Speaking to the media today Bengaluru, ICB chairman Vinod Rai explained that the pitches in both Pune and Bengaluru needed to be replicated again in Ranchi in the “best interests of sportsmanship.”

“This morning, we made a formal request for another ‘gibber stone flat’ drop-in pitch from a regional shire council in South West Queensland,” he said.

“The pitch comes almost completely devoid of life, save for a few small tufts of spinifex and Mitchell grass. However, we expect those to be dead by day two of the Test in Ranchi. The curators there have since assured my that it will crumble at the same rate as the Pune pitch. We felt this is the best course of action given what’s happened so far.”

The Indian deal has fanned the flames of interest in the bustling drop-in pitch industry that’s taken the South West Betoota Business Park by storm.

Already, a number of Caribbean stadiums and cricket government bodies have expressed interest in purchasing pitches from Betoota, as the action and theatre produced by them in India has been a relative ratings bonanza for Fox Sports – owner of the exclusive broadcast rights.

Local sociopath pours disgusting dollop of milk into his tea each morning

There is a man who works for a local IT business who is normal in every other way, save for the fact that he enjoys drinking his tea with milk.

As his disgusted co-workers look on, Johnathon Tabernacle often leaves his desk around 11 each morning to fix himself a cuppa. For the most part, he fishes his mug out from the cupboard and drops a Dilmah in with some boiling water.

He doesn’t even let it sit.

With the rest of his office dry retching has the 37-year-old doesn’t skip a beat as he retrieves his full-cream milk from the fridge, the sociopath introduces the cold milk to his boiling tea – leaving a thin curd film on top that often gets stuck between his teeth.

“If you put milk in your tea, you have rocks in your head,” said a coworker.

“But he takes it to a whole other level. He’s good at his job and he’s not a bad bloke, but fuck me. When he has those curds stuck in his teeth and he’s carrying on, it creates a real gun-in-mouth type scenario. He’s fucked in the head.”

In 2011, the Fair Work Commission and a local court concluded that an employee of a Longreach service centre was not guilty of an alleged violent assault that stemmed from an argument over putting milk in tea.

An apprentice of the service centre had 24-inch breaker bar wrapped around his head after trying to explain to a fellow mechanic that putting milk in your tea is disgusting and unAustralian.

The tribunal decided that he was totally within his rights to use force after the man tried to force him to drink the tainted tea.

He even came straight from work with his laptop bag slung over his right shoulder, with all intention to head home to the misso and go to dinner, as planned.

“If I know I’m going to get sideways, like old-fashioned 18-year-old blind, I’d leave my computer at home and put on a pair of fucked jeans and a drinking shirt,” he said.

“A drinking shirt is a shirt you’ve fucked on the turps. A step up from something you’d toss in the rag bin. Anyway, needless to say I was wearing my best kit last night when we got on the rums.”

Last night, around an hour or two before The Betoota Hotel called last drinks, the 28-year-old’s mate came back from the bar with a big grin and a tray of rums.

“We bought for about £900 I think, back in 1951. That was two years’ wage for me back then. The bank we very sceptical of us, being immigrants. But we made it.”

Selling their 1950 sqm block for nearly $7m, Cenzo and his Australian wife, Doomadgee, are well placed to help their boy into the Sydney property market.

Marchello Farrugia found work in the financial services not long after graduating, but has found difficulty achieving the same things his parents did when they lived down in the Harbour Republic.

“Mate, Dad has been giving me an absolute pizzling about not wanting to get a million dollar loan out when interest rates can only go one way. He’s got rocks in his head, the jibbering old cunt. He still thinks it’s the 60s,” said the 28-year-old.

“If I did get a mortgage and really stretched my arse to pay it, like a lot of my mates are doing at 1.5%, if the rates go up, you’re fucked. First of all, the asset is worth less, your repayments go up and you’re probably going to get bent over in stamp duty. You’d be fucking mad.”

In response to his father’s requests to buy property, Marchello tried to explain that he’s amassed a share and commodities portfolio worth in excess of half a million dollars.

“Nope, the old fuck wants it in bricks and mortar. Love him, but fuck me rone. He’s got fucking rocks in his head.”

The Big Fella Still Hasn’t Encountered A Big Brekkie He Couldn’t Put Away

TEXT:

When it comes to bragging, local bloke Lewis Gurr (26) has got a few different yarns he can trot out.

For one, he was listed as in the possible and probables for the under 16’s state Aussie rules side in 2006.

That, and the fact that he once met Ryan Moloney (Toadie from Neighbours) at the Carindale Westfield Boost Juice kiosk.

He also had a great uncle play for the Rabbitohs.

But there’s one bragging right that stands above the rest. Lewie has never once encountered a cafe breakfast that he couldn’t finish.

“It’s almost a ritual now. I don’t care how much it costs, if there’s a big brekkie listed on the menu. I have to have it” he says.

“Sometimes I order extra beans”

Lewie admits that when it comes to eating $34 dollars worth of red meat and carbohydrates, he does tend to perform better if he’s familiar with the venue, and nursing a hangover.

But he’s still undefeated.

“I’m not saying its been easy. I almost always get the meat sweats”

“My best day is usually Sundays. Not only is it a good way of recharging yourself for the week ahead, but it’s a great way to impress a lady friend… If I’ve been lucky enought to have a sleepover the night before”

Local woman, Jahleighya (22) says she was astounded to see Lewis’ performance with the knife and fork, after a one-night-stand last weekend.

“He blew me away. The way he inhaled those caramelised mushrooms. He’s such a dark horse”

“He was just gulping down at least 500g of fried bacon like a pelican… It was quite impressive”

With a new cafe opening up down the road, Lewy says he wishes good luck to any small business trying to make a crust in his local area, but he’ll be the judge of whether or not their brekkie is really that big.

Local Polo Player Comes Out To Teammates As A Publicly-Educated, Catholic, NRL Fan

TEXT:

After being inspired by countless publicly-educated, working-class and Catholic rugby union players, a local polo star has decided to own up to himself and his teammates by coming out to them in a touching ceremony at the Betoota Racecourse this afternoon.

Calling a team meeting late last week, Connor Sampson asked for privacy and understand after telling his fellow teammates that he was born into a working-class family.

“Not only that, fellas. Not one, but both of my parents are Catholics. We even owned a burgundy Commodore when I was a kid,” said the 29-year-old.

“And I haven’t really told you where I went to school. My high school had no boarding facilities and nearly half of the pupils were born overseas and pretty much 90% had one parent born overseas. It was a real melting pot. Real rugby league type set up. I’m sorry guys.”

However, coach John Hargrave-Combrell said he had his suspicions from the start.

“He says the letter ‘H’ like a rock-chopper,” he said.

“That and he holds his cutlery like they’re pencils. Fuck me that’s common, by the way. Makes my skin crawl. Revolting. Anyway, he’s not a bad bloke, he’s just no a P.L.U. [Person Like Us] You know what I mean? He’s good for a beer and a yarn, but you wouldn’t let him pollute your bloodline.”

The Betoota Polo Association declined to comment on the matter, but an internal investigation has been launched.

Bloke named Sam can’t understand why local barista can’t spell his name right

TEXT:

It’s enough to drive even the most blasé bloke up the wall and make him wonder if the person he’s interacting with has rocks in their head.

An intern at Betoota Base Hospital has been getting a large strong flat white every morning since getting the prize posting to the desert capital late last year.

Sam Madden has made his way through the doors of Cafe Pisse Dans Ma Poche in the Old City district for the last twelve weeks, ordered his coffee and croissant then told the barista his name in a clear and dulcet voice when asked for it.

“And the dip stick still manages to fuck it up,” said the 27-year-old medicine graduate.

“Some days it’s Pam, others it’s San or Son. The bearded fuck simply cannot wrap his head around the three-letter-spelling of my name. People who speak Engish as a seventeenth language could work it out. I’m beginning to think it might be personal.”

Madden revealed to The Advocate during an interview this morning that if the barista misspells his name again tomorrow, he’s going to jump the counter and knock him out where he stands.

“Then I’ll put him back together at the hospital after I’ve calmed down a bit. But fuck me, it’s enough to drive you mad.”

However, upon speaking to Mitchell Brown, the barista at the centre of the storm, it seems that the whole thing is a simple misunderstanding.

“Pam is one of our best customers, I love him! [laughs] Large double shot flat white, no sugar! [laughs] Yeah, I know Pam. He’s a legend,” said Brown.

“Yeah, but nah, know what you mean, aye? Bit weird for a bloke to be called Pam. At first, I thought he was a she. But you know, these days you can’t really make that judgement without looking like a Mel Gibson-type social goblin. It is what it is, then you die [laughs].”

First-Year Uni Students Still Feverishly Taking Down Notes In Their Lectures

TEXT:

Despite studying a wishy-washy journalism degree, a number of first-year students have tried to get their tertiary education experience off on the right foot by taking down comprehensive, colour-coded and detailed lecture notes in each lecture they attend.

The same number of students also still haven’t discovered that lecture attendance isn’t compulsory for many of their first semester subjects.

Walking out of her 10am COM111 Professional Writing lecture for the first time this morning, Bathurst broadcast journalism student Lauren Collidin said that even though the content of the lecture was quite elementary, it was interesting none-the-less.

“Look, I didn’t miss anything,” said the 18-year-old as she flicked through her brand new notepad.

“I took four pages of notes. But I kinda knew most of the stuff the lecturer was talking about, but I didn’t want to miss anything, you know.”

After being told that her Professional Writing subject doesn’t require compulsory attendance and that a Monday morning sleep in until noon is more than theoretically possible, the studious Sagittarius said that she wasn’t going to screw her education up by falling into bad habits early.

“There’s no chance I’ll ever end up at summer school,” she said. “Could you imagine spending your whole summer in Bathurst? I’d rather put a shotgun in my mouth and blow my brains onto the ceiling.”

“Ergh! Having a bunch of townies try to stick their tongue down your throat at Club Medusa every night, Jesus wept! No thank you! By thinking it’s OK to skip lectures, you set yourself up for failure. No thanks.”

White Male Who Grew Up In Violent Foster Home Still Blind To His Privilege

TEXT:

Bouncing between foster homes until his 18th birthday, one local man once considered himself to be underprivileged.

Never really knowing his parents but knowing the sound of a belt being taken off all too well, John Petersburg of South Betoota explained to The Advocate for all his shortcomings and internal crises, he still should feel privileged because of how he looks.

“There are still times when I just feel like crying for no reason,” he said. “And my fear of abandonment and trust issues prevent me from connecting with another human being on anything more than a superficial level, but I also thank my lucky stars I was born a boy and whiter than Ascot bedsheet.”

While the 29-year-old insurance broker stops short of describing his early life as privileged, he does concede that other people his age had it worse.

“Look, the other day I got grilled by this chick at a party who said I didn’t understand how lucky I was to be born the way I was, which confused me a bit but, you know, I tend to avoid confrontation so I just back away,” he said.

“But yeah, nah. If I was a disabled transgender woman of colour, then yeah, I guess I got it better than she did. But fuck me, you can’t just make these types of assumptions on people. She reckoned I was blind to my privilege as a white male, which is pretty much true. But I got kicked out of every home I’ve ever lived in and had to fight for everything I’ve had. If it was easier because I was a white male, I’m fucking sorry.”

Mr Petersburg then spoke about how if he was still blind to his privilege, he’d rather stay blind forever.

Conservative Woman Only Triggered By Vodka And A Good Time

“I’m here for a good time, not a long time,” said Emile Davenport as she down the last of her vodka sunrise and raised her eyebrows at the barman for another.

The 29-year-old mergers and acquisitions specialist joined the team at Bell Potter’s Betoota office half way through last year and her bosses have said she’s taken to the multinational like a Frenchman to a stick of butter.

Speaking to The Advocate on Friday, the saucy Scorpio said she sees the pitfalls in each side of politics and has elected to ‘just move on with her life’ than get bogged down getting triggered all the time.

“I don’t know how they do it, you know,” she said.

“I mean, they’d be so tired all the time getting worked up over nothing. Like nothing. Boom, seeing a bloke with his legs apart on the bus, ‘Oooohh you manspreading prick!’ Yeah, well maybe he’s just trying to get comfortable. And all that other shit, I just can’t deal with it.”

Ms Davenport also revealed her secret to career success, explaining that you don’t get anywhere by trying to stick it to the man.

“Fuck me, I’m so wasted, but fuck. Listen. You don’t get ahead by trying to beat the game. You win by being the best at playing the game. Just live in the moment and work hard. Oooh fuuuuck… I’m going to vomit.”

The UQ alumnus’ sentiments were echoed by her managing partner and local philanthropist Gavin R. Pearson AM.

“We don’t employ people here with a political agenda here at Bell Potter Betoota. We employ people who enjoy smoking inside and the odd drink. Mixed touch is compulsory. It just works. No Catholics, either.”

Just Like Google: Sociopathic Millennial CEO Ups The Perks With $48 Ping Pong Table

TEXT:

The employees of Betoota’s third-fastest-growing mezzanine boutique marketing firms smile and give their boss a double thumbs up whenever they see him.

Not because of his ability to steer the company from strength to strength, not because he smashes quarterly profit predictions and makes the investors happy.

They love him because he made sure that one of the first assets the company had, well before they even had any clients – was a ping pong table. Even though their jobs could disappear at any moment and he doesn’t seem to show any form of human empathy.

“I know how much start-up employees value having the ability to play table tennis whenever they want,” said Orifice Director/CEO Liam Conch..

“Taking five minutes to relax and switch off can really help productivity. That and the coffee machine! [laughs] That really helps! But the location, in my opinion, is most important. Finding this little hole in the wall in the Betoota Old City was so rare – I knew we had to have it.”

“It make them totally forget that there is no HR department in this place, and that I haven’t been paying Super”

However, not everybody in town is a fan of Orifice’s ping pong table.

Late last year, local pastoralist Jack Pearson visited the marketing firm to see what they could do to help him launch a new product.

The 71-year-old is set to become one of the biggest exporters of Brahman hump to China and simply wanted some advice on how to market it there.

“You should’ve seen it, mate. This smooth-hands chino-wearing fuck head was spinning some serious bullshit my way about China and whatnot. Then, fucking then, he asked if I wanted to verse him in a game of ping pong?” said Pearson.

“You wanna know what I told him? I said, ‘of course I don’t, you stupid cunt. I’m here to talk business and you’re trying to get me to play table tennis? The fuck is wrong with you? Did you get shaken as a baby or something?’ Jesus fucking wept, mate. You wouldn’t read about it.”

Jack Pearson refused to comment whether he’s doing business with the boutique firm.

Cabinet Files: ASIO Approaches Local C.W.A Branch For Tips On How To Keep Secrets Secure

TEXT:

The local chapter of the Australian Country Women’s Association is being observed by several government agencies, it has today been confirmed.

It is believed that the ATO, ASIO and The Australian Bureau Of Statistics have been keeping a close eye on the Betoota CWA branch, in an effort to learn better investigative skills and improve their practices of securing intelligence – following the embarrassing ‘cabinet files’ saga that saw top secret documents detailing in the internal operations of 5 Australian governments.

Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull says after learning about the artillery of secrets held by the Betoota CWA, he has instructed cabinet members to look towards the branch as a case study into word of mouth metadata.

“These women are quite in the know. They can tell you everything about anyone. If they trust you”

“We need to look the CWA as a whole. They are a very organised intelligence agency”

Executive members from the local branch of hit back at the accusations of gossiping.

“Well, some of us like to gossip. But not all of us!” says a the defensive branch president, Celia Grayndler.

“It’s just that, some people tell us things. If someone has something to say, you need to lend an ear”

“That’s what a community is all about”

However, scorned ex-CWA member, Wendy Darmer believes that a culture of gossip does, well and truly run deep behind the cakes stalls and in the community halls around Australian.

She says she walked out on the Association when she found out that the girls had been spreading rumours about her daughter Janelle, who left town suddenly last year.

“Janelle had a job in the big smoke and had a falling out with Celia’s daughter. That’s why she left.

“It’s not because she fell pregnant to one of the African men in the travelling tent boxing troupe”

“She didn’t go to jail either”

Well-Liked Teenager With Loving Parents Hasn’t Found A Reason To Hate Immigrants Yet

TEXT:

A South Betoota teenager who has a healthy relationship with both her mum and dad has not yet found a reason to hate people, it has been confirmed.

Despite facing all the same anxieties and pressures that most teenage girls face in senior school, Elyse Peters (17) has not yet had anything happen to her that would be easily blamed on immigrants or Aboriginal people.

Elyse’s dad, Ryan, says he knows there hasn’t always been much money around during Elyse’s childhood, but both he and his wife feel they have made up for it by by being as emotionally available as possible.

“The last thing I wanted to do was be a flakey Dad”

“I turned down a job in the mines for that reason, I guess I just wanted to be around for when she needed me most”

Elyse says that while she realises that there are minorities that access a bit more government assistance than her family, she acknowledges that her family were just very lucky to not have had to experience the heartache of leaving your home because of lack of opportunity or safety.

“I guess I’m lucky to never know what it sounds like to hear a bomb dropping from the sky, or how it feels to lose a loved one to a preventable disease” she says.

“Maybe one day they’ll be able to live a life as blessed as mine was, I hope so”

However, Elyse’s neighbour and childhood crush, Benno (17) says he’s always been a bit more sceptical of immigrants, especially since his dad took off.

“Mate, why should they get to come here with their beautiful families and enjoy days out in the park with their tight knit migrant community who look after one another” he says as his eyes well with tears.

“I’m sick off them. I can’t even find a job and they get to play for Australia in cricket!”

Bored Kid In Pub Denied 2nd Glass Of Lemonade By Dad Who Just Put Away 5th Schooner

TEXT:

South Betoota man, Luke Morris (33) is very wary of his son’s sugar intake.

In fact, every time the family goes out for a feed at the local pub, he has to keep an eye on how many soft drinks the little fella is consuming – because he knows how much he loves the stuff!

“That’s enough, Lote” he says, as his son approaches his mum for a second glass of lemonade.

Luke finishes his fifth schooner of Betoota Bitter and heads towards the bar.

“Yeah, mate. Same again.”

“Listen if this little fella comes up again asking for a soft drink I want you to cut him off [laughter]”

“He’s had too much already!”

Oblivious to the hypocrisy that is on display for all as Luke orders another round of drinks, which cost far more than a glass of lemonade or fanta, and probably aren’t much better for him, Luke decides it might almost be time to have a rum and coke.

With the wives and girlfriends still sitting down at the dinner tables, and the kids running around on the carpeted floor in the play area, Luke makes his way back to his table of mates at the Lord Betoota Hotel.

“Alright, I think the missus is gonna take my kid home. Johnno, does your kid wanna have a sleep over?”

“Let’s tie one on cunts”

Farmer Suddenly Anti-Wind Power After Learning What Show-Pony Neighbour Got Paid For A Turbine

TEXT:

Betoota farmer, Tony Braithwaite has been staunchly opposed to the rise of renewable energy in his local area, after learning what the fuckhead whose property neighbours his southern end is being paid to host two wind turbines.

Chinese-whispers suggest Tony’s neighbour, Johnson is being paid upwards of $110k, per turbine, per year in rent from a Government agency.

“It’s fucking with my cattle” says the diary farmer whose fence line is roughly twenty kilometres from the nearest horizontal axis power generator.

“It’s fucking ridiculous that just because this bloke has a bit of wind, that we should all suffer.”

“Don’t get me started on all the health risks of having a these things [50 kilometres] from the homestead!”

Tony’s neighbour, Johnson says that he didn’t know too much about renewable energy until some bloke came to his place and said he wanted to look at the top of his hill.

“I don’t know mate, I just happened to have the windiest spot in the district. I didn’t mean to piss anyone off”

“But I do think it’s a better option then penetrating the artesian water basin with fracking drills”

“That’s not the money talking, either. I honestly don’t think its a good idea to let the Chinese fuck around with an ancient underground body of water”

However, Tony says Johnson is just being a uppity blueblood chardonnay socialist.

“Mate we’ve lived here for two generations and no one needed any extra wind back then, why do they need it now”

“The money has gone to his head, he’s not thinking straight”

“He’s not even here half the time. Probably lounging around in Noosa or somewhere flash like that”

40 is the new 20, Says Mid-40s-Ultimate-Frisbee-Enthusiast

TEXT:

When Peter Pan was just 20-years-old, he hitched across Australia with two friends for a whole year.

Next year, he plans to do it again.

Speaking to The Advocate this morning, the North Betoota podiatrist explained that turning 40 was a day he was dreading for a number of years – but now he realises that was all silly.

“I’ve never felt better,” explained Pan. “Well, perhaps I did feel a bit better when I was 20, but I was expecting to be a broken down lump of skin and organs by now, so it’s refreshing none the less.”

“I used to laugh when people said that 40 is the new 20. That doesn’t make sense. Is 30 the new 10? Because if it is, I belong in prison! [laughs]”

While Mr Pan says he credits his youthful vitality to a strict diet and exercise regiment, there’s a number of ‘body and soul’ activities he does during the week that also make him feel at peace.

He also roots a lot as well.

On his 33rd birthday, he was gifted a racing bicycle from the local rotary club for his many years of philanthropic service to the community.

He and his fellow Betoota Cycling Club members enjoyed years of fun, competitive racing around town before one of them ended up having a close call LandCruiser after cycling through a red in the Old City district.

“That was when I really started to confront my own mortality,” said Pete.

“I haven’t committed to a woman since then. I’ve got plenty of time. I’m really getting into my frisbee right now, brah”

Cold War Between Housemates Over The Washing Up Enters Seventh Day

TEXT:

Depending on which one you talk to, each member of an infamous sharehouse in Betoota’s Old City district will tell you that they’re not the one to blame for the washing up spiralling out of control.

Beginning life last Saturday night after a small gathering of friends, the washing up from that humdinger was left to soak in the kitchen of the 4-bedroom terrace overnight.

However, that’s the last the five occupants agree on.

“The day after, Julia [front bedroom] decided she needed to bake a cake,” said Tony from the rear, upstairs bedroom.

“The kitchen basically looked like Kosovo after that. But the thing is, Jules cleaned up a bit after she was done. But I don’t think she wiped down the bench. Then when the cake was done, she took it up the coast with her until Tuesday.”

That’s when Hamish from the storage-space-cum-attic-bedroom decided to chime in.

“I don’t think that’s exactly right,” he said. “She cleaned up the bowls but not the food processor.”

The 24-year-old then asked our reporter for a cigarette.

“Jules should know better, her cousin is a chef. Anyway, Tony and Borris think it’s my turn to do the washing up, because today is my rostered day. But fuck that, I barely use the kitchen. Why should I have to do it.”

Borris explained that Hamish needs to do it today because it’s his allotted day – and his own rostered day is tomorrow.

“There’s absolutely no way I”m doing it tomorrow,” said Borris, from the master bedroom.

“If Hamish doesn’t do it today, then why should I do it tomorrow? Why bother even having a washing up roster? I don’t know why I made one in the first place.”

As there’s nothing going on around town at the moment, The Advocate plans to follow this developing story into the coming work week.

Brisbane Girl Lists Full-Time Occupation As ‘Acre-Chaser’ On LinkedIn

Not wanting there to be any confusion as to where she sees her future, a QUT graduate has contentiously listed her full-time occupation as an acre chaser.

Making sure never to miss as Friday at Fridays, the 23-year-old also visits other country haunts such as Johnny Ringo’s and The Vic each weekend looking for the grazier of her dreams.

Taking time out of her important Friday pre-game last night, Dominique Coffey explained to The Advocate that while she enjoys a fulfilling and rewarding career at Queensland Rugby Union, it’s not her calling in life.

“I love these footy boys here, but a three-bedder in Wavell Heights isn’t for me,” she said.

“I’d pretty much go anywhere, to be honest. The sickly river wind that blows off this town is wearing me down, the bush is calling me. The only way I’ll ever get there is by cutting shapes on the d-floor at Johnny Ringo’s to Toby Keith or by tarting myself up and hobbling around Fridays until close.”

The wily Scorpio’s plan almost worked out with a kind-hearted Yaraka man, but after learning that his property has nothing but gibber stones, gidgee and broken dreams, the Thorneside local broke it off.

Emmet Avery’s humble 37 000 ac property on the Retreat Road wasn’t much to look at, but the 29-year-old bushman told The Advocate that it had more than enough carrying capacity to put a few boys through Toowoomba Grammar.

“Yeah, Dom and I would get our chong on every now and then,” explained the Longreach Pastoral College graduate.

“But when she discovered that the block I’m in line for is a bit rough, like the house is a bit how-ya-going, you know, could use a woman’s touch and all that, but yeah, joog. No good.”

Adele probably not the best music to be playing during teen’s first green out experience

TEXT:

A North Betoota high schooler as journeyed through a portal to hell last night after overdosing on cannabis last night during a sleepover at a friends place, The Advocate has discovered.

During a week-long exposé on the rampant use of marijuana among local teens, The Advocate was able to ascertain that 17-year-old Echidna Curlewis shared a cannabis joint with two close friends sometime yesterday evening when proceedings took a turn for the worse.

Detective Superintendent Simon Cottrell was called to 34 Rockaway Crescent at 7:30 pm last night after reports surfaced that yet another North Betootanese high schooler had overdosed on THC.

“There’s a strain of pot going around town called Captain Starlight, which can put nearly any seasoned stoner on their arse quick smart,” he said.

“That’s all good and well if you’ve had sweet Mary Jane over to your house before and it isn’t your first rodeo, but if you’re just experimenting with the drug – the results can just be so, so bad.”

Overdosing on the drug is often referred to as ‘greening out’ and is seen as a rite-of-passage among the sticky dank smoking community.

However, when Mr Curlewis greened out last night, Adele’s Grammy Album-of-the-Year ’25’ was softly playing in the background.

“That was the worst part,” explained Echidna.

“I couldn’t stop the room from spinning. Didn’t care that I was in bed, I knew I was in bed. I just vomited up the party pies we had for dinner and knew that Matt’s mother would just probably feel sorry for me.”

“I’m never smoking pot again. Never.”

Grill’d Employee Says Your Order Is Too Easy And It Won’t Be Long, Buddy

A counter employee at the South Betoota Grill’d burger franchise has broken a personal record this afternoon by saying ‘buddy’ seven times in the space of fifteen minutes.

Abbie Locke (19) blew away her equally chirpy coworkers by just going for it, and rattling out as many buddies as possible.

Grill’d patron, Matt Puccinelli says the first word that Abbie said to him was ‘Buddy’.

“Buddy. How are you today? What’re you chasing, buddy?” she said.

Matt says he was startled.

“I kind always expect a rush of personality when I go to one of these joints” he said.

“But two buddies, back-to-back. I thought she’d at least mix it up and call me champ… or pal… But nah, I copped two of them”

“Fuck me she was a keen bean”

While listing the different sauces and two types of bun available, Matt says he was treated to another three buddies before even handing over his card.

“I honestly thought that was the end of it” he said, clearly traumatised.

“I put away my burger in silence, at the front of the restaurant and tried to creep away in silence, but she caught me”

“How was that buddy? Have a good one buddy” she shouted from the kitchen.

Matt says he picked up a light jog and headed back to his office.

Despite the fact he has been a committed skateboarder since 1999, local plumber Rick Garley (32) still hasn’t done any of the cool tricks that he first got him interested in the hobby, from the award-winning Playstation Game Tony Hawk Pro Skater 1.

After just under two decades of consistent skateboarding, Rick still hasn’t done a Switch Nollie 360 through two random panes of glass attached to the roof of an abandoned warehouse for no reason.

“I haven’t even done a melon grab” he says disappointingly.

“Or a Japan Air”

Rick Garley says that if, by chance, he was able to get free reign on a completely abandoned warehouse with fourteen vert timber ramps built throughout it, he might be able to get enough momentum to smash through the glass box on the roof.

“But I wouldn’t be able to spin through it. It’d have to be a No Comply”

“I still listen to the Dead Kennedys and Goldfinger, so ideally that would be blasting in the background while I fly through levitating secret tapes”

Local high schooler discovers rare artefact from bygone era

TEXT:

In what’s being hailed as a discovery of a lifetime, a 17-year-old local boy has stumbled across an old pre-plain packaged deck of lung busters – something completely out of his world.

St Gregory’s South Betoota student Oisin Breathnach revealed to The Advocate that at first, he didn’t know what he was looking at. But upon asking his father what they were, it immediately became clear that it was something significant.

“Dad said, ‘Where the fuck did you find these?’ and I was all like, ‘They were in a biscuit tin in the pump shed, up in the rafters,’ then he was like, ‘Fuuuuuuuccckkkk I remember!’ I hadn’t seen him that happy for ages,” said the peer support leader.

“Then we went out on the deck and Dad asked me if I wanted to join him in enjoying some pre-Nicola Roxon one-lady-crusade lung candy and of course I said yes. They were a bit stale and red durries give me serious head spins but they were nice.”

Adding to the rarity of the find, the deck uncovered was a soft pack. Something unseen in this country since the introduction of plain packaging legislation in 2012.

Marketed to children and young adults as being their ‘International Passport to Smoking Pleasure’, the Peter Stuyvesant were often reserved for special occasions – such as birthdays, christenings and post-coital cooldowns.

“I used to suck my way through a soft packet of these bastards a day when I was his age,” remarked Oisin’s father, Conor.

“Only the best tar for my lungs! [laughs] [coughs] Yeah but, that was many moons ago and I gave that shit up when I had me boy. Still miss it, though.”

Instant coffee cafe an instant hit with people who just want a fucking coffee

TEXT:

Hitting back at the recent descent into coffee snobbism, a new local cafe is fighting the trend by offering only instant varieties as well as a number of basic breakfast dishes.

Nathan’s Cafe is the latest addition to West Betoota’s famed Cordillo Street dining strip which already has half a dozen cafes and restaurants.

However, owner operator Nathan Decanter reckons his place has what it takes to lure customers away from the “limp-wristed-$4-a-cup” type joints that have come to infest the district.

“While we’re finishing the kitchen, we’re only offering small artisan dishes for breakfast,” he said.

“The Shearer’s Breakfast has been popular, which includes a smoke, an organic piss and a look about. Coffee is extra. You can throw in a shit and a Blend 43 for $2 extra.”

Complete with instant coffee tins from around the world, the 28-year-old entrepreneur insists they all taste the same and customers shouldn’t worry about getting a nasty shock when sipping on his java.

Instead of baristas and waitstaff, Decanter has installed an endless hot water tap that the customers can help themselves to.

“You can come in and get an International Roast in a styrofoam cup for $1. If you promise to chuck your empty cup in the gutter, we’ll only charge you 50 cents. Also, nothing says ‘cowboy’ like a long black. So if you want milk or sugar, keep walking. There’s plenty of blokes you can kiss down the Fat Blue Duck, or whatever that wanker magnet is called down the street.”

Smoking is also compulsory at Nathan’s – unless you’re pregnant. A collection of dusk masks are available for those who are.

“We might be simple desert folk, but pulling a Chrissie Swan is heavily frowned upon at Nathan’s,” said Nathan.

“If you come in, put a mask on and protect your bub. Look forward to seeing you down here.”

Aboriginal Aunty At NAIDOC Knows More Family Names Than The White Pages

TEXT:

Aunty Jess knows more people than Facebook does, it has been confirmed today.

With a large extended family, and a talent for remembering names, there is very little that happens without Aunty Jess knowing about it. Not that she’s a gossip, she just knows everything.

When asked by her children, or nieces and nephews, what the go is with someone, Aunty Jess usually has an answer.

Her sister, Mandy says sometimes it sounds like she’s making shit up.

“I was working with a blackfella from Perth the other day. I told Jess about him and she knew his whole family. That’s about 3000 kilometres away”

“She asked me how his Pop was doing? in Broome!?”

With NAIDOC in full swing, Aunty Jess has said hello to 400 people this morning.

Jonathan Thurston says he can’t remember where he first met Aunty Jess but she’s always looked after him.

Wendell Sailor swears he’s related to her, through his mum’s side.

Adam Goodes even wrote her initials on his sweatband before the Swans 2012 Premiership-winning Grand Final match.

Aunty Jess refused to make comment about how she knows every one fuck ya.

Nation’s Florists Just Pulling Prices Out Their Arse For These Morons

Local bloke, Ed Moore (27) is of the understanding that an individual rose always costs $65 per stem.

“Jesus, I don’t why we are going to war over oil when there’s fields of this shit somewhere” he says in front of the 19-year-old assistant florist who has guided him to the last remaining Valentines Day Roses at 11am.

“This is fucking criminal”

While often surprising his girlfriend with a one off bouquet of hydrangeas – or whatever looks like it is about to be thrown out – each February 14th, Ed has to shell out a good amount of money for roses, because the media tells his girlfriend that she should expect roses around that time of the year.

“Mate it’s daylight robbery. How the fuck can these things cost so much. Even with the cost of Australian labor I’d expect there to be blokes who could make plastic replicas for less”

With a three course meal booked at a restaurant that he won’t like, and tickets to film he will also not like, Ed says he’s just lucky he has her birthday, anniversary and Valentines Day staggered across different quarters of the year.

“For fucks sake, I’d be a broken man If I had to take all three hits in the same month. I’m stretching it as it is I had to sit back and watch Winx win by three horse lengths yesterday without putting a cent on it”

Student Lies To Herself And Says She’ll Wake Up Early And Finish Assignment

Rather than putting the finishing touches on her last essay of the semester, Daniella Sawkins elected to head out with friends and enjoy the last Sunday evening of term at the local.

Enjoying a miscooked $10 rump with the sauce she didn’t ask for, one sem-sav-sunrise quickly turned into seven and before she knew it, the 20-year-old architecture student was back in her dorm room, trying to stop the world from spinning.

Now facing a 9 am deadline tomorrow and a hangover that only people over 30 should feel, Ms Sawkins revealed to The Advocate this morning that it wasn’t the voice of reason in her head last night – it was the devil.

“It’s just 4 000 words on how Walter Burley-Griffin was largely under-appreciated during his time in Australia, but since his death, there has been a growing recognition of his work,” she said.

“It shouldn’t be that hard. I just wish I didn’t go out last night. But honestly, this is one of the worst hangovers I’ve ever had in my short life. I feel like I’m having an aneurysm. I thought I was giving myself a break, but I guess this is how I ended up in this mess in the first place! [laughs] I can see myself in summer school already,”

Legend Pulling Cones In Middle Of Vibrant House Party Definitely Running From Something

TEXT:

Despite the fact that his friend’s house party is well and truly pumping, Brad Miller (20) has decided to find a table in the courtyard and smoke marijuana non-stop through a ceramic bong.

The fact that he has brought his own novelty bong with him to a party where most people are drinking cocktails is not lost on the hosts or other the other partygoers, it has been confirmed.

One witness, Sarah, says his behaviour is flat out anti-social.

“There’s a few people here smoking joints. That’s pretty standard behaviour but to sit down and just rip billies is pretty full on”

“He’s even doing that thing that stoners do where they tap the cone piece with the lighter to make sure it all goes through”

Brad’s close mate, Tyler, says its not rare for the boys to smoke bongs, but in front of heaps of people, most of who are standing up, is pretty weird.

“I hope everything is alright at home”

“There’s heaps of chicks here. The ratio is good, all the booze has been put on… Not sure why the big fella is sitting there playing the gatorade sax”

When asked for comment Brad said something about the amount of people wearing lame collared shirts and pointed out that the music was shit.

Local Dad Makes Quick Dash To Get The Car Ready After Watching ‘Lion’ With The Family

68-year-old fibreglass swimming pool builder, Glenn Hardman has left his two adult children and wife in the lobby of his local cinema to quickly go and get the car ready, it has been confirmed.

Without saying anything about the film they just watched, Glenn whispers ‘I’ll meet you in the car park, I think your mother wants to go shopping’ – before making a dash for the exit.

With the whole family getting together for a family day, Mr Hardman was dragged against his will to see the 2016 award-winning drama ‘Lion’.

This film, which tells the emotional story of an Indian-Australian man’s homecoming to his family village in the subcontinent, was ‘not a bad flick’ – according to Glenn – who refuses to say anything about how the film made affected him emotionally.

Glenn’s family find him half an hour later, his eyes appear bloodshot and moist, he says this heat gives him hay fever.

“The air con in the cinema dries my eyes out and makes them react in a funny way” he says to his family as he turns on the car

“How’d you lot like the film? I thought it was alright… (hiccup)”

Touching! This small town came together to murder ‘unpopular’ local resident

TEXT:

On the first of August last year, the body of a retired teacher and former scoutmaster was found in bushland on the edge of Betoota.

Dennis Coolidge was discovered in a shallow grave with his hands tied behind his back, covered in multiple burns and contusions and two small calibre bullet wounds to the back of his head.

Local police initially suspected foul play, but after a number of local residents came forward with information regarding the 68-year-old’s untimely demise, detectives and investigators ultimately ruled the death ‘a tragic suicide.’

However, the big city Roma Street prosecutors smelled a rat and immediately challenged the findings of the South Betoota coroners office.

The appeal proceedings lasted until today, with local magistrate Ellen Ferguson upholding the findings of the initial investigation conducted by detectives from the South Betoota Local Area Command.

“In relation to the death of Mr Coolidge in late July last year, the initial findings and conclusions made by the local police are upheld,” said Justice Ferguson.

“The suggestion that Mr Coolidge was executed by some sort of vigilante mob and buried out in the gidgee is detrimental to the reputation of this town and the rumour surrounding a police coverup is extremely harmful to the reputation of the Queensland Police.”

According to local folklore, Dennis Coolidge was dragged out of bed in the middle of the night and tortured for a number of hours by both local police and residents.

As the sun began to rise, Coolidge was driven to the edge of town, just past the last light post – and shot twice in the back of the head with a sawn-off .22 rifle.

A half-hearted investigation was launched before his remains were injected with 1080 and left out on the claypan for the dogs.

Crown prosecutors and independent investigators were unable to properly conduct an investigation because by the time they arrived, Mr Coolidge’s remains had been eaten by dingos and nobody in town would talk to them.

“They got away with it – and there’s nothing we can do about it,” said prosecutor Miles Woolson.

“The people of Betoota are all somewhat guilty of premeditated murder, by some degree.”

Bloke Who Arrived At Pub After Kitchen Closed Now Eyeing Off Free Lamingtons In Pokie Room

TEXT:

Arriving at the pub at 8:45 was not a good move for Sydney man, Charlie McCarthy (29).

After a late client meeting, he rushed to meet his remaining unmarried mates at the local Bag ‘n’ Famish Hotel, only to learn that he had just missed the opening hours of the kitchen.

“I should have known better. Of course you can’t get a feed in Sydney after quarter past eight”

“The kebab stores have even been told to shut down at sunset”

With his mates now jovially enjoying ice cold schooners of Betoota Bitter with hearty chicken shnitzels swishing inside them, Charlie has no option but to keep moving forward on an empty stomach.

“I think I’ve got some ramen at home. But, the bottom line is, the missus thinks I’ll be with clients till midnight, so I’ve got to last until at least then”

With his stomach rumbling loud enough to tell him that he’s going to be much more hungover for choosing to not eat, Charlie is now eyeing off the complimentary lamingtons placed next to the coin machine in the air-conditioned smokie pokies.

“Oooh I do love a bit of coconut” he says, while taking a handful.

“They look fresh enough. They’ve been under this sneeze guard”

Charlie says if he needs anymore after this he might have a crack at the Monte Carlos or the Minties.

“A bit of dessert wouldn’t be too bad”

Bloke’s handwriting is so appalling he gave up trying to spell correctly years ago

TEXT:

There was a time in Sam Grotley’s life when he used to care about his handwriting, but that part of him died shortly after Peter Brock miscalculated a downhill sweeping left-hander.

Not long after, the predictive text and spell check on his mobile and laptop left his desire to spell words correctly slowly peter out also.

Now at 23, the Brisbane-native has been thrust back into the handwriting realm as the Hutchinson Builders project manager is required to handwrite run sheets, order forms and other official documents.

“It’s fucked,” he said. “I can’t use a pen anymore, I just scribble and hope it comes out legible enough for other people to read it. All I can manage now is to get the up and down letters in the right spot and just make a few marks where the vowels would be.”

However, Mr Grotley isn’t alone in his shame.

Thousands of other young professions who cast their handwriting skills to the wind are now finding themselves back in the shackles of pen and paper.

Another Brisbane 23-year-old spoke to The Advocate just a short time ago, who not only has had to learn how to write again – he’s had to learn a whole other language.

“You’d think at journalism school they’d teach you something useful, like desktop publishing or how to edit videos,” said James Grogan, of New Farm.

“Nope, they taught us fucking shorthand. My handwriting already looked like fucking Arabic. Now I had to get my penmanship back up to scratch, plus learn this pigeon English script that nobody ever uses anymore.”

Unfiltered White Ox Rollie Confirms Dodgy Landscaper Has Spent Some Time In The Pen

TEXT:

A group of Betoota roadside council workers have today concluded that the older bloke who has been put in charge of one of the utes has probably spent a bit of time in the nick.

Their assumptions come from the fact that he smokes roughly one unfiltered, roll-your-own White Ox branded cigarettes every 15 minutes, also the spiderweb tattoo on his elbow, and the fact that he doesn’t seem to have a problem with being so blatantly lazy.

18-year-old landscaper, Rylie, says even though it’s his first job, he knows better than to get the older bloke offside.

“Man. I’m only doing this for a couple months until I take off on a surfing trip with my mates. The last thing I want to do is get on the wrong side of some bikies”

“Fuck me. All he does is move the ute 20 or so metres every half hour. Sometimes he doesn’t even do that and we have to walk the snippers back to rewire them”

“If I knew a bit more about the bloke I’d get fair up him. But I don’t. And I think he’s probably killed a bloke before”

The foreman of this particular group, Ted, says he shares Rylie’s anxieties.

“I don’t know who hired this bloke but he’s fucking dodgy”

“I’m supposed to be his boss and he’s the one telling me what to do”

“I’m stuck because if I give him the sack I’m gonna spend the rest of my life jolting into the bushes every time I heard a motorbike engine”

With smoko around the corner, the older bloke who smokes White Ox has told the boys he’ll meet them at the pie shop 350 metres down the road. He’s taking the ute.

Grown man still thinks it’s appropriate to have that t.A.t.U poster above his bed

TEXT:

When leasing agent Lisa Ackorn found herself stumbling into Kevin Foster’s bedroom early on Saturday morning, she knew she’d made a serious error in judgement.

“If I knew he had a poster of those t.A.t.U girls pashing on his wall, I probably wouldn’t have got in the cab,” she said. “That and the picture of a Lamborghini Countach that’d obviously been ripped out of a magazine stuck on the inside of the toilet door. My brother did that when he was 15.”

“Honestly, you don’t expect a grown man to have soft porn sticky-taped to his bedroom wall.”

Ms Ackorn spoke to The Advocate this morning and explained that it’s not the first time she’s ended up in a 30-something’s den only to find something mildly childish or downright inappropriate stuck to the wall.

The 29-year-old South Betootanese Gemini stated categorically for the record that when she was courting The Advocate‘s editor, Clancy Overell, he had a picture of him and then girlfriend Kerri-Anne Wesser with a dolphin they’d shot during a fishing holiday to Port Douglas in 1999.

“That was back in 2009. Clancy had a 10-year-old picture of him and a topless Kerri-Anne with a gut-shot dolphin on his bedside table. I almost fainted, it was so graphic. I’d looked like he’d started butchering it.”

“It’s not very appropreate to have HUNTING photos on your bedside table as a single-and-mingling man. I can only image how June felt down at Betoota 1hr Photo felt when she saw those pictures come out of the machine. They’re simply revolting.”

Insurance Analyst, (40), Ready To Get Fucked Up After Listening To Old DMX Playlist

TEXT:

Local insurance analyst, Luke Maestri, has spent the morning remembering the good old days when he and his mates would drink 660ml cans of Woodstock Bourbon and fight cunts.

Despite living a sterile, white collar existence – Luke is having warm feelings in his loins as he thinks about when he was ‘about that life’.

These feelings, he says, come from the nostalgia associated with US rapper DMX. After playing an old playlist titled ‘GanGstA’ on his way to work this morning, Luke says he’s definitely still got love for the dog.

“Fuck. I feel like getting turnt up” he says.

“Where the hood, where the hood, where the hood at?!” he raps along to the lyrics of the the lead single from DMX’s fifth studio album Grand Champ.

“Really gets the blood pumping”

With his wife visiting her parents at the coast this weekend, with both kids, Luke is currently firing off a large amount of text messages to the boys – who also work in brain-numbing white collar jobs.

“Do you know anyone selling beans?” he asks on of our reporters.

“I wouldn’t have had a goog in ten years”

When asked if there is any chance that he will be involved in alcohol-related violence this evening, Luke says it all depends on where they go.

“We could go down and float around the RSL skate park like we used to. Bound to find a biff there”

“Either that or we’ll sit on the deck at Richie’s beachfront A-Frame. It’s very quaint”

Cyclist Forced To Overtake Inconsiderate Driver From The Inside During Peak Hour

TEXT:

Local cyclist, Anthony Loveridge (45) says inconsiderate drivers are plaguing his people.

“We feel unsafe all the time. They never let us in, they drive too slow”

While weaving through peak hour traffic on the way to his office, that doesn’t have shower facilities, Anthony says he gets irritated by these obnoxious cars who sit just under the speed limit. He says it’s not like Europe at all.

“Australian drivers don’t even understand what a peloton is. In Germany, white collar workers ride in packs of 48. Australians will barely even let eight of us past at once”

After 18 months of lycra, Loveridge says there’s only one way to get past the cars that are plaguing his mid-life crisis: Undertaking.

Overtaking on the inside or undertaking refers to the practice of overtaking a slower vehicle on a road using the lane that is curb side of the vehicle being passed. The practice of passing on the inside, usually only occurs on a motorway or other road where there is more than one lane in the same direction or when the width of the roads makes this possible.

Anthony doesn’t need a lane.

“I’m usually going a lot faster than them. They seem so concerned about hogging the middle of the road, so I just zip down the curb”

“It’s the only way to do it. They are so unsafe. They make me feel unsafe”

Charity Pest Ignored By His Own Mum At Train Station

TEXT:

Imagine being ignored by your own mother. The person who brought you into this world. Imagine her looking at you, pretending like she had never seen you before in her entire life.

That was the nightmare scenario that Marty Wilson, a 23 year old university student faced this week.

Whilst studying an Arts degree at the University of Western Queensland, Marty picked up some casual work over summer spruiking donation plans for an international charity cartel.

And while he admits “chugging” (charity mugging) isn’t the greatest job, and has had some pretty tough encounters, Wilson said that “My mother coldly stone walling me was about as tough as it gets.”

“I know she saw me. She literally looked at me from like 15 metres away and just stared at the ground. I walked up to her and was like “Hey Mu,” and she just pretended to be on her phone and kept walking.”

Wilson says she walked alongside his mother for about five metres before giving up, and standing on the footpath completely flabbergasted.

“I’m so used to getting brushed by all the “busy people,” but Jesus, that was tough” Wilson exclaimed.

Wilson’s mum Natalie refused to comment on the matter, saying “I have no idea what you or Marty are talking about.”

Wilson told the Advocate that he already hated his job and the whole experience has pushed him closer towards quitting and re-taking a job at Woolies.

As Another Male Approaches On Darkened Road, Local Man Puffs Himself Up To Appear Larger

TEXT:

Striding home with a gut full of piss sloshing around in his tummy, West Betootanese apprentice carpenter Ellis Liston spotted another suitably intoxicated punter stumbling back to his flat on the other side of Bjelkemander Park.

In 2016 alone, there was nearly 40 muggings and seven stabbings in Bjelkemander Park in the space of six months – something that has the 18-year-old on edge.

“Yeah look, I don’t usually cut through the park this late at night and I typically wouldn’t do it alone. But last night I was just shit-faced, like walk into the pisser at the pub and bumble up to the urinal and just wet your pants type drunk,” he said.

“That and my feet hurt and I just wanted to get home. Anyway, I had to walk past this bloke in the park, which was fucked. Worst case scenario. So I puffed myself up a bit and made a lil’ eye contact on the way past,”

“Not too much, but just enough to let him know that I’d fuck him up if he tried anything. Know what I mean?” he said.

Much to the relief of Betoota’s only triage neurologist, the two were able to pass each other on that darkened path without incident.

Dr Campbell Dearden has seen too many of the town’s youth come through his operating theatre in the past few years and he wants to extend his congratulations to the pair for acting like adults.

“The only time violence is justified is if you come across somebody with absolutely no spatial awareness who walks slower than Kim Beazley,” said Dr Dearden.

“By all means, deliver a swift judo chop to the brain stem, at the top of the neck and just watch them fold like a private school boy in handcuffs,”

“Other than that, keep your bloody hands to yourselves! Stop punching each other!”

According to the financial services industry, the more a young creative professional spends on a South American holiday, the more they save.

That bit of sage advice is not what spurred Morgan Hatton to tackle the world’s second-most dangerous continent – he looked his friends and family in the eye and said with a straight face: “I want to go sight-seeing and relax.”

Thinking he’d fooled them all, Morgan’s parents laughed and shrugged before explaining to friends that they were young, cashed-up and child-free during the 1980’s – and they know exactly why the 24-year-old has selected Colombia as his first port of call.

“Does he think we’re dumb?” said mother Gwendolyn. “We were young once. Young and wild. He’s just trying to live like his father and I did in the 80’s. Everything that he wants to do here is much, much cheaper over there. I just hope he keeps his head screwed on.”

Impressive Wheelies On The Rise Amongst Aboriginal Youth In Remote Communities

Australia’s beleaguered Aboriginal communities are particularly vulnerable to an array of social issues, however, nothing compares to the rise of flawless and very impressive wheelies, which seem to also have firm grip on the Indigenous youth.

“They’re deadly” says local jarjum, Braith Bridley (12).

“My cousin, Jai did two whole laps of our block the other day”

“It’s fun as”

However, many of the local police view impressive, 30 metre-long wheelies as a gateway to other anti-social activities, like being loud and telling people to fuck off.

Sergeant Nate Fromere from the South Betoota Command, says the kids could be getting up to worse things, but it’s still something he keeps an eye on.

“I suppose it’s not that bad. But what does it lead to?

“It leads to other stuff that kids find fun because they are desperately under-stimulated in a town plagued by alcohol and drug abuse and are looking for boundaries. That’s what”

“I mean, the last thing I want to do is take in a local kid to the cop shop for something petty, like not wearing a helmet, or fucking around in front of traffic. But if they cause a stir, then I guess I only have one option…”

Wedding Now In Doubt After Bride-To-Be Fails To Notch Triple Digits On Engagement Pic

In what can only be described as a complete an utter embarrassment to both family names, recently-engaged South Betoota forensic accountant, Molly Tuxworth (29), has failed to bring in over 100 Facebook likes on her seemingly staged engagement photo.

Uploaded with the caption: “So this happened…”   Molly believes she was not treated kindly by the Facebook newsfeed algorithm.

“I don’t know if I post it at the wrong time of the day or what” she says with a ferociously competitive tone.

“Some of the girls I went to school with have gotten over the one-k mark with just a photo of the ring on their hands – and some of them weren’t even that popular during school”

The underwhelming social media upload, which shows Molly’s boyfriend Mark proposing to her one one knee, just fell short of the ‘saving face’ mark of one hundred Facebook likes.

Mark says he didn’t even know she had uploaded it and was kind of waiting to tell her parents first.

“Yeah. We’ve called off the wedding” he says.

“Not because she informed everyone about the engagement over social media, but because she’s disappointed with the feedback. She says it’s setting a bad tone”

“In my personal opinion, the caption could have used a bit of work and maybe she could have rattled off a few emojis. I don’t know.”

“I’m moving to my brothers house for a couple months”

Bar Staff Rush To Help Man Whose Hands Are Obviously Too Tiny To Carry Four Schooners At Once

TEXT:

When Bob Hawke explained to parliament in 1988 that the most emasculating thing a bloke could do is ask for a drinks tray, he meant it.

Since then, carrying four schooners of full-carb beer from the bar back to the boys has been a life skill passed down from father to son, mate to mate. But for one effeminate Sydneysider, the task of ferrying the four piss jars back to the long table has always been impossible.

“I have tiny hands,” said Patrice Everesté, a private wealth manager from Sydney’s Upper East Side. “The boys always hang shit on me when I come back from the bar with a tray, like some sort of girl.”

Not being able to carry four schooners has taken a significant toll on the 29-year-old’s self-esteem, as his friends simply will not let up on the insults and personal criticisms.

“They ask me if my boyfriend likes my little hands,” he said. “I’m not gay, by the way. But you know, it’s 2016 and there’s nothing wrong with being a petite-handed boy-kisser. Plus, I hate beer. I’d rather just settle in with a nice bottle of Mudgee pink and people watch.”

However, just when things were beginning to look up for the soft-handed nice guy, one of his mates noticed that he also had comically small feet.

Explaining to The Advocate that he doesn’t really care that Patrice has size-seven feet, drinking friend Joe McCombmac stated categorically for the record that he thinks Everesté has “cute, but petite feet” and “weak little hands that couldn’t even open a tin of soup.”

“Yeah look, mate,” said McCombmac. “I know we always rouse on Pat about being a little gay boy who can’t carry four schooners and having the feet of a child, but he’s a pretty good bloke and tells ripper yarns. I understand he’s pretty good at his job,”

“They must have a tiny keyboard for him to use [laughs].”

Bloke Who Started Selling Sourdough In Country Town Thinks He’s Jamie Fucking Oliver

TEXT:

Basic foods with a pretentious twist are being offered at extortionate prices on Betoota’s main street as a fast talking blow-in from South Brisbane opens the town’s first hipster cafe.

Justin Hampel, a 37-year-old wastrel with a trust fund and a bullish belief in his entrepreneurial skills, said he had “curated a menu which pays homage to traditional Betoota fare”.

Experts have branded the move “an expensive wank” – Deconstructed surf and turf and a legume-based alternative to chicken parmigiana are among the options on the menu, sources close to the venture told the Advocate.

In an exclusive sit-down interview, Mr Hampel said the menu is “subject to seasonal variation” and most items are “gluten, nut, egg, dairy and sugar-free” because “most people have an allergy, even if they have no medical evidence to support it”.

“I just want to be fully transparent with the supply chain. It’s gotta be organic.”

Lifetime Betoota resident Rusty Fitzsimons said: “It is an expensive wank.” – But the Betoota Chamber of Commerce said it welcomed any attempt to prise cash from passing trade.

“In today’s globalised world, dickheads with food fetishes are more mobile than ever and you never know when a busload of latte-sippers will roll into town,” a spokeswoman who asked not to be named said.

Local Dad Talks About His Childhood In The Bush Like It Was In War-Torn Syria

TEXT:

Despite the fact that he grew up in very similar socio-economic circumstances to the ones he provided his own children with, local dad Peter Stretton (58) talks about his upbringing as though his area was a failed state.

“In my day we had to walk 20 miles barefoot just to get to school” he said.

“In the snow!”

His children decide against asking him why there was snow in regional Queensland when he was younger, only to hear about the perils of communism and how their dad nearly got sent to fight in Vietnam at 9-years-old.

Mr Stretton makes a point of telling his children how lucky they have it.

“You lot don’t understand, this area was fucking rough I tell you”

His oldest son, Angus, intervenes.

“Dad didn’t you spend your holidays at Thredbo as a kid”

Dad bites back.

“Thredbo wasn’t what it is now. It was a rough old town back then. We used to have to fight every day, just to survive”

His son continues his line of questioning.

“Why the hell did you parents drive 400 kilometres to take you to a skiing town where you had to fight people?”

“Because it was good for us! You lot wouldn’t understand. You’ve had it too easy.

Office Morale Lifts After 2nd-Hand Sandwich Press Appears In Lunch Room

TEXT:

Terry Cranston was ready to quit his soul-destroying job as a customer service officer when a seemingly second-hand sandwich press arrived in the lunchroom at his South Betoota office.

The 46-year-old opted against hitting send on a terse letter of resignation and instead took his multigrain cheese and tomato sandwich from the insulated pouch in his work satchel.

“I had given the old sandwich press a wide berth because my coworkers refused to clean it and it was caked with coagulated cheese,” Mr Cranston told The Betoota Advocate.

Mr Cranston said he was the first to road-test the slick Teflon plates of the new unit, which was so generous in proportion that an entire loaf of Turkish bread could be clamped inside.

“As I removed my piping hot sandwich from the press, all thoughts of giving my job the arse and studying documentary filmmaking by correspondence slipped from my mind,” Mr Cranston said.

The middle-aged public servant is one of thousands of Australians who stay in jobs they hate because their employers offered a small perk when they were about to throw in the towel.

Katie Portmanteau, a 27-year-old solicitor from Revesby, said she was poised to quit on Monday by flipping the bird at her supervising partner but was placated by the arrival of the weekly fruit box.

“I can’t imagine working in an office where I have to buy my own mandarins,” Ms Portmanteau said in an email sent at 2am as she was leaving the office in a taxi.

Powering Through A Medium-Rare Chicken Parmigiana Last Night Comes Back To Haunt Local Man

TEXT:

He was already annoyed at having to work on a Saturday, but things were about to get a whole lot worse for one North Betoota courier.

As he hugs his Caroma Sovereign Trident toilet this afternoon, 39-year-old Bert Liston can feel the hand of Satan slithering through his insides – looking for a way out.

Pressed for time, the Scorpio ducked into his local tavern at around 8pm last night for a spot of tea and a couple of pints of bitter before choosing to have an early one.

“They do a good feed down at the Dolphins Club,” said Liston. “Reasonably priced and tasty. Can’t complain.”

Ordering his one of his favourite dishes, the chicken parmigiana, Bert hoped to be in an hour in about an hour, but time simply got away from him.

“The food came out late, took those fricken backpackers in the kitchen almost an hour to get me breaded bird from the freezer into my gullet,” he explained.

“It was a bit pink when it came out but I was just so hungry, I didn’t care. I just powered through the pink parts and washed it all down with a double Turkey lemonade and got back in my van feeling refreshed and impaired.”

However, in the early hours of this morning, Bert started feeling a bit crook. Driving back home towards the Old City District, Mr Liston began slipping in and out of consciousness.

Arriving home after sideswiping 37 cars, he collapsed on the floor of his Betoota Heights duplex and almost Hendrix-ed himself on the rug. Dragging his way to the powder room as he described it, Bert spoke to The Advocate via telephone.

“Yeah mate, I shouldn’t have eaten that medium-rare chicken. I suspect I may have blood poisoning or something to that description. I feel crook, mate.” he said.

STAFF XMAS PARTY: Local Man About 3 Craft Beers Away From Alluding To Cocaine

Even though it’s Monday, the Brightley Lawyers Christmas Party is as boozy as an awkward staff event can be.

Booking out a local rooftop bar with river views, they have an endless bar tab and permission to really let their hair down.

Local para-legal, Richie (27), doesn’t know if any of his work-obsessed colleagues are into this kind of thing, but he can get his hands on some $200 bags.

That’s if they’re keen.

Richie approaches the subject with a known marijuana user, Fiona, but her initial response appears to be one of confusion, almost disgust, as she steers the topic directly back to their previous conversation about the recently pregnant chick in HR.

Richie reckons after about three more craft beers, he’s going to throw the idea to the floor on a public setting.

“We’re here all night” he said.

“There’s an open bar and not much food getting around. Personally, I’d prefer to not be the drunkest bloke here”

“If any of these dorks want in, I’m gonna make the call”

Verbally Abusing Bar Staff Best Way To Convince Them That You Aren’t Too Drunk

TEXT:

ROCKING UP TO A pub he’s never been to before, Dale Edridge joined four other mates as they ventured into the city for a hard-earned drink-a-thon at one of Brisbane’s most recognisable destination hotels.

Hopping on the train at Trinder Park station in Brisbane’s cosmopolitan Gold Coast corridor, the 23-year-old and his four companions shotgunned their first Jim Beam tin as the 9:20am express to the heart of town pulled out of the station.

Arriving at Central just after 11am, only one of the party was deemed to be lucid enough to enter a licensed premises, much to the chagrin of Edridge, who was barely able to contain himself.

Finally, after what seemed to be hour upon hour of public drinking, the hedonistic quintet finally found a place where they could pull up at the bar and get some serious liver bashing done.

Ordering his ninth ‘cougar and coke’ of the night, Edridge was finally cut off by bartender Ernie Godfrey, a 19-year-old QUT law student who ‘quite simply doesn’t get paid enough to deal with bottom draw humans’ such as the 23-year-old apprentice waterproofer.

“I said get me another drink, you worthless little cunt before I jump the bar and turn your brain off at the wall,” said Dale, pointing his stained index finger.

“Get me another drink before you get some trouble.”

That was when Ernie looked at Edridge’s mates as if to say, “Your mate is about to be slapped by these nice bouncers and left to asphyxiate on Edward Street if he doesn’t leave right now.”

But his silent pleas fell on deaf ears.

“We tried to make him leave with us,” said pal Mark. “But he was adamant on getting another bourbon. The manager even came over to try and defuse the situation, but at the end of the day, the only thing that was going to shut Dale up was a swift, concentrated palm-strike to the brainstem.”

It was over in a flash. Dale was last seen by his friends being loaded into an ambulance after a bouncer gave his thinking box and serious one-handed workover.

After flopping about on an Edward St footpath like a carp on a river bank, one bouncer said it was like holding down the power button on a frozen laptop until it turns off.

“That’s kinda [sic] what happened to this prick, aye?” said  security specialist Serevi Heritage.

“We kept saying, ‘Move on, cuz. You don’t need what’s about to happen to you in your life,’ but he didn’t listen.”

Mr Edridge is expected to make a full recovery.

Report: Plastic Tip Of Zooper Dooper Probably Just Going To Be Left In The Sink

TEXT:

A recent report from both the CSIRO and Australian Bureau Of Statistics has found that the top of the Zooper Dooper is probably just going to be left in the sink until either your mum scoops it out or it gets washed down the drain.

The study found that roughly 30% of all plastic found polluting the ocean waters off Australia’s eastern seaboard come from the top part of the summer ice block.

Local stay-at-home-son, Tim (26) says that it’s only a little bit of plastic, and it’s not like it’s going to clog the pipes or anything.

“It’s not that bad” he says, ignoring the fact that it is probably of a sufficient size to choke most forms of sealife.

“It’s just… I’ve already starting eating it. And I don’t wanna have to open the bin. My hands will get dirty”

“Just relax. It’s not a big deal”

150-Year-Old Pub On Last Warning For Noise After Waking Up Echo (3) And Atticus (1)

TEXT:

The Lord Kidman Hotel, located in the inner-Betoota suburb of Roma Hills, has been fined for not taking into account the fact that the neighbouring residents expect to be able to go to sleep whenever they want.

Despite standing in the same spot for 150 years and being owned and run by the same family for six decades, the venue has been put on notice by local council, who today informed them that the concerns of urban homeowners are much more important than the business model of the century-old public house.

It is believed that the weekly Thursday night live music managed to sneak it’s way the single brick wall dividing the pub and the neighbouring renovated worker’s cottage, waking up Echo (32 months) and Atticus (12 months).

Pub owner, Bruce Bruce (72) says that he didn’t realise that it was his duty to cater for the lifestyle of young urban professionals who decided to buy terrace houses next to his pub because it was cheap.

“I’m honestly so sorry” he said.

“I didn’t realise that our resident Thursday night band, who has been playing here since the Whitlam dismissal, was causing so much grief to our new neighbours – who haven’t yet introduced themselves to me after five years”

Local council inspector, John Wowser, says the initial fine for noise ($3000) is more of a warning call.

“A lot of these old beer sellers don’t realise that times have changed. They don’t realise the only thing local council and the state government care about is insuring that property prices go up”

“Right now it’s just a few fines and increasingly hostile relationship”

“Eventually we’ll do what Sydney has done – and convince old people that all people who go to pubs are also homicidal maniacs who enjoy punching promising young white men”

“Then we’ll bring in some lock-out laws to shut them down completely”

However, publican Bruce says shutting them down might be a bad idea for the neighbours.

“Where else are these 30-year-old men going to be able to find a takeaway bottle of rosè at eleven in the morning?”

“Or an ATM to draw out $300 at midnight when his missus takes the kids to her mothers for a weekend”

Local man claims wife has been doing ‘Mannequin Challenge’ in bedroom for 20 years

TEXT:

Rob Denton, a 63-year-old married man, has today claimed that his wife of 40 years, Camilla, did the first mannequin challenge over 20 years ago, and “doesn’t think it’s anything to write home about.”

“I’ve seen this ‘Mannequin challenge’ thing all over Facebook,” began Denton, 

“And it took me straight back to the 1990s – not long after the wife and I had just had our third and final child.”

Denton, who admitted he only recently joined the social network as a way of keeping tabs on his now adult children who never call, said unfortunately he doesn’t have video proof of originating the meme, as his wife would never allow it.

“Way back in the mid-80s when camcorders and VHS tapes were starting to take off, I proposed the idea of, you know, keeping a record of our bedroom activities… but she was never really up for it.”

“And as things have slowed down in the hanky panky department, so has Camilla’s desire to get into things in any way, shape or form,” he lamented, before adding, “Stiff as a board”.

“She always asking for more slap and tickle, but I think it’s just like anything around the house. She doesn’t necessarily enjoy the lawn being mowed, she likes to see me mow the fucking thing when I’m hungover”

“Just like she likes to see me huff and puff in the sack. She may as well light up a cigarette while I’m at it”

Betoota reached out to Camilla for comment, who said, quite matter-of-factly, “Perhaps my husband would be better of with an actual mannequin for wife, as no real person can pretend to ignore how out of shape he’s gotten.

Plain-Clothed Gold Coast Cop Blends Into The Youth With Trendy Denim Shorts And Polo Outfit

TEXT:

THOUGH THE BABY-FACED PUBLIC servant is well into his twenties, Constable Damien Longshanks from the Broadbeach LAC has chosen his trendiest threads to pound the pavement tonight as a plain-clothed policeman.

Tasked with keeping Queenslanders safe from the scourge of public drunkenness and MDMA, the 29-year-old spent some time this afternoon putting together his look in his Pacific Pines apartment.

“I’ve got these radical SMP denim shorts because I know it’s going to be sticky as Redskin golly tonight,” he said.

“The kids don’t wear sneakers anymore, they’ve gone out of fashion. I’ve got a pair of New Balances that are both comfortable and practical. I could run down Darius Boyd in these bastards. But yeah, mate. It’s all about blending in.”

Longshanks concedes that he won’t be able to wear a ‘cool’ belt on the count of all the gear he has to carry with him while on duty, such as handcuffs, mace and a Glock 17.

Another thing he doesn’t have time for are ‘drug dealers’ or members of the wider community who are ‘looking to buy drugs.’

“We take a pretty dim view of those people,” explained Damien.

“If we find dealers making trouble or taking advantage of somebody, drag them into a fire escape or something and just go ham on them. Those extendable batons are next level, they’re almost as effective as the Glock. Then we put their wheezing corpse into a ‘drunk chair’ and wheel them out onto the beach to sleep the beating off.”

“Just another way we’re keeping everyone safe.” he said.

Entitled Millennial Slowly Discovering What It Was Like To Be A Cricket Fan In The 80s

TEXT:

His parents finally felt safe to bring a child into this world when they saw the sea of Berliners taking to the wall with sledgehammers and crowbars.

However, when communism was dying its slow death, it was also a time when the Australian cricket team was also dying a quicker, less humane death.

After years, perhaps even decades of being the perennial bridesmaid of Test cricket, the Australians slowly emerged from the easy-beat shadow to become a powerhouse of the sport.

William Dunkirk was born into that post-communist world that saw the western economies buck and pull against the reins and experience unbridled growth and prosperity. Along with that boom was the growing dynasty that not only cricket and rugby union enjoyed, but Australian sport, in general, became accustomed to.

However, now that the nation’s cricket team is teetering on the verge of another period in the sporting wilderness – and it’s got the 24-year-old feeling something he’s never felt before.

“I haven’t lived in a world where Australia is just mediocre at sport. It’s an odd feeling,” he said.

“It feels like everyone from the Wallabies to the roundball boys are slipping into minnow status.”

“But it’s the cricket team that’s got me worried. You can’t go about making Rob Quineys out of these youngsters. You’ll break their little hearts. How can you judge a bloke based off one game? Warney got carted in his first Test. Tendulkar went to town on him, but Alan Border stuck with him.”

“Now I know how Dad felt after the big names from the 70s retired.” he said.

Local Papou Says Greece Has Needed Their Own Donald Trump For A While Now

WEST END, Brisbane (QLD) –

Despite arriving in Australia as a post-war migrant in the mid-1960s, a local Greek-Australian grandfather says that he thinks Donald Trump will be a great President for America.

Not only that, he says that Trump’s tough stance on terrorists, immigrants, hippies and the political class is something both Australia and Greece could learn from.

Yanni Gerbanas (85) says the splintering of political factions in his home country is pathetic and the rise of a working underclass has been something he has warned everyone about for decades.

“What I tell you?” he roars at his art student grandson and his hairdresser daughter over coffee this morning.

“Donald is great. Greece need a Donald. Australia need one”

Following the successful ‘Grexit’ referendum in 2014, this grandfather of fifty-four says all Greece needs now is a no-nonsense leader who will drain the bureaucratic swamp of his Greek politics.

“Greece says fuck you to Europe. Greece leave. Now Greece need a Donald”

Even though the retired construction and real estate magnate can’t seem to get along with other Greek-Australians who weren’t born in the exact same village as he was, he believes a Trump-esque leader is exactly what Greece needs to unite the people.

“Too much lazy” he roars.

Snow falls in Betoota this morning

AN INCH OF SNOW blanketed Betoota for the first time in recorded history today.

A severe weather alert has been issued by the Diamantina Shire Council to drivers as the first significant snow of winter fell across a large swathe of the Simpson Desert, Channel Country and much of the interior.

High-level routes via Windorah were hit by the wave of snow which swept across the west of the region from Wednesday evening.

Authorities took to social media to warn of difficult conditions from Birdsville, through the Quilpie flats to Jundah.

“Oddly enough, this isn’t the strangest news event of the past 24 hours,” wrote Shire social media manager, Wendy Constantine.

“No roads are closed at this stage, but yes folks, snow has fallen in Betoota. Whether it’s a freak occurrence, “global warming”, or climate change, we’re not sure.”

Queensland Police issued a yellow ‘Be Aware’ warning for much of the west of Windorah, the north-eastern tip of South Australia, parts of the Channel Country and North East of Cordillo, which was due to expire mid-morning on Friday.

Weird Lull Between Footy And Cricket Results In Deeply Personal Conversations About Life

TEXT:

The brief four-week lull between the conclusion of both the AFL and NRL football seasons and the start of Summer cricket has resulted in some bizarre conversations about life and adulthood, a local publican has confirmed.

Brad Coughton, a 20-year licensee of the Lord Betoota Hotel, says this time of the year gives the punters a much needed break from live sporting broadcasts.

“They all say that they are bored, but secretly they love it” he says.

“You get a good 4-5 weeks completely void of professional sport. The blokes need it. They end up talking about their kids and their parents. It’s really quite refreshing”

While Coughton says there are a lot of tears and often a bit of ‘argie-bargie’ as grown men, and occasionally their female peers, unwillingly take part in an unavoidable patch of human thought and discussion – he says that it’s very important.

“The Spring Carnival gives them a bit of a boost in this November downtime, but for the most part they are forced to base their alcoholism and socialising around conversations about real life,”

“Two of the blokes that drink here have gotten divorced in the last 12 months and I didn’t even know. I see them everyday and I had to wait until the Grand Final was over for them to tell me”

With test cricket starting in less than six hours, it seems the punters are going to have to wait until next October to finish their current train of thought.

“I think he even greeted them with ‘sup’ – again, like it was normal for him to be acting so youthful,”

Joshua’s son, Alex (17) has also noticed a cringeworthy change in his dad’s behaviour, as the middle-aged bank manager experiences a transition of identity and self-confidence, as is common when individuals discovered they are no longer a part of Triple J’s target demographic.

“His Spotify playlist is very painful,” says Alex.

“It’s all rap music from a few years ago. I heard him refer to Kanye West as ‘Yeezy’ the other day,”

Local Greek, Toolio Runamakas has made a wild assumption that the two girls standing at the bar of the South Betoota Hotel are not Greek.

But he’s gonna check, just in case

“Hello ladies, my name is Toolio. I was just wondering… Do you girls have any Greek in you?”

The girls, Sarah and Sophie (both 22) who are initially impressed by his ethnically instilled confidence, respond.

Sarah: “Not that I know of”

Sophie: “No, but my grandma was Italian.”

Toolio responds.

“So, no Greek in you?”

Girls: “No”

This response is exactly what Toolio had been hoping for, as this seemingly innocent conversation turns into a light-hearted attempt at maybe having sexual intercourse. He asks another question.

With both women deciding not to answer and now feeling kind of creeped out, Toolio saves the day with a subtle back pedal from his intense mediterranean style of courtship.

High School Invites Bartenders To Speak To Year 12 Class About Perils Of Studying Theatre

TEXT:

Eliott Franklin’s afternoon routine hasn’t changed a whole lot since he graduated top of his class in theatre history and performance media.

The arts graduate checks the tyre pressure on his bicycle, then loads up Kid A by Radiohead for the 40-minute ride to work. He’s a 25-year-old who works weekends – a magical time of the week taken for granted when he had dreams for his future.

He was always good at theatre and history as a high schooler, so Elliot thought it was natural to continue on with his personal strengths at university. He’s still in the bartending job he had while he studied, with no light at the end of the hospitality tunnel.

Seven years on, Franklin is now warning Year 12 students about the dangers of following your passion after school, urging them to challenge themselves by studying something useful.

Speaking to the Class of 2018 at Betoota Central School, Elliot says the bar he currently works at down in Sydney has “destroyed his soul” and has turned him into a bitter person that he barely recognises in the mirror.

“When I was studying, I was completely oblivious to the brick wall I was speeding toward,” explained Franklin, choking back tears.

“In order to me to keep my head above water, I need to work 6 days a week and the only time I have off is a Monday night. The friends I used to have in person now solely exist in WhatsApp. I’m here to tell you that following your passion in life isn’t what society has led people to believe. Just do law or finance or engineering – anything. Just don’t do what makes you happiest in life because you’ll end up without a chair when the music stops,”

“When I’m riding home really late at night and there’s nobody about, I sometimes blow straight through a red light with my arms outstretched listening to Thom Yorke wail and hope a truck cleans me up. That’s the only time I ever feel truly alive anymore, when I put my life in the hands of fate.” he said.

Mr Franklin’s advice comes as thousands of Year 12 students begin their leaving exams around the country. With this small bit of advice, Elliot hopes that the young people of Betoota make the right decision with their university entrance rank.

Rockhampton Man Visiting Chinese Joint In The City Asks Staff For Knife, Fork And Spoon

TEXT:

It was a small step for Marshall Bradey to agree to dine at his now local Chinese restaurant, but it was a giant leap to expect him to use a pair of chopsticks.

The unrefined 29-year-old plumber was lured to his cultural doom by Sally Callaghan, his current casual partner who’s looking to make what they have a little bit more serious by taking him out of his culinary comfort zone.

Arriving at the locally-famous Ellen’s Oriental Bistro in Wickham street, Marshall was under the impression that this Aussie-style Chinese would have a knife, fork and spoon for the uninitiated diner – but this eatery was a lot more traditional than Bradley thought.

“This is the type of Chinese food stop that has a Lazy Susan on every table. For Christ’s sake, they even have Crown Lager on the top shelf of the fridge,” explained Mr Bradey.

“But for some reason, they didn’t have any Australian cutlery. What do they expect? That everybody in this windswept brothel town know how to use chopsticks? Next thing you know, they’ll be asking you to order in Mandarin!”

“But yeah, nah. I gave it a go because Sal was nice enough to drive, because she knows how much I love to crush a gold straps over dinner.” he said.

Eventually, after a few finger-friendly entrees and Crownies, Marshall’s primary teacher missus tried to teach him how to use chopsticks – but ultimately failed.

“Look, he’s a nice enough bloke. There’s not too many half-way decent blokes in this town – especially ones that have a good job and rough hands,” explained Ms Callaghan.

“To his defense, he really did give it a red hot crack, but he was a bit too pissed to master the fine motor skills needed for chopsticks,”

“So he just had seven more Crownies until he wasn’t embarrassed to eat dinner with his hands. I just stared out the window and wished I’d never left Ascot the whole night.” she said.

Local Farmer Still Fantasises About Getting His Fucking Hands On Paul Keating

TEXT:

Renowned Western Queensland grazier, Roger Tully (74) still can’t help think about all the sadistic things he would do if was lucky enough to spend a couple hours one-on-one with former Prime Minister Paul Keating.

Mr Tully says his livelihood as an agricultural producer was ‘put to the fucking test’ under the Keating Prime Ministership (20 December 1991 – 11 March 1996).

By dropping the floor price on Australian wool, deregulating the banks and floating the dollar, Paul Keating earnt himself a lot of enemies in the bush. Tully says that if he was ‘half-mad’ in the early nineties, he would have ‘the bloke’s head off with some pre-buyback era hardware’.

“That smug prick once said the best way to see the bush was on a commercial flight to Paris,”

“I’ll give him a real good reason to avoid this part of the world,”

While not trying to upset his wife of 55 years, Maggie, Mr Tully points out that in his recurring fascination, Paul Keating is held at gun point and forced into a cattle crush, where he is exposed to hours of Outback-themed torture.

“I always wanted to put my family brand on his arse,”

“Maybe douse him with a bit of unleaded and flick matches at him,

“Maybe shear his head. Just so he can get up close and personal with some form of agricultural, for once in his fuckin’ life,”

With the imminent sale of Kidman station to a Rhinehart-Chinese conglomerate reported this week, Mr Tully has no doubt in saying that the growing disconnection between politics and the bush is a direct a result of the Keating era.

“That little wuss was too caught up in collecting grandfather clocks and linen suits. He never did a thing for us,”

With a crazy look now in his eyes, Mr Tully’s wife suggests it might be time for a sugarcane champagne on the rocks before bed.

Cluey uni student uses Brita filter jug to retrieve goon back from her vomit

TEXT:

BEING A STUDENT IS HARD, especially when you need to shield yourself from your bleak future with cheap wine and petty sexual contact.

It’s also remarkably expensive.

That prompted Kelly Mosshart to invent a novel way of cutting down the costs of being a student – by vomiting into a Brita water filter jug when she feels queasy after an afternoon inhaling wine with friends.

“You know when I started, you could get a six pack of Moscato for $10 down at the Cobb&Co, now you’d be lucky to get two lots of rolling papers for that,” explained Mosshart.

“Mum was concerned with the hardness of the water here, so she got me one of those water purification jugs that Labrador-owning women like to buy. Long story short, I came home from a huge night absolutely blind. Before I threw myself into bed, I grabbed something I could vomit into just in case,”

“Upon retiring to bed, I couldn’t get to sleep because the whole room was spinning, you know? We’ve all been there. So I went heave-ho into the jug and let the darkness come over me.”

It wasn’t until the following morning when the 24-year-old journalism student made the discovery that ultimately reshaped her financial outlook for the rest of her time at the regional university.

Slowly coming to, hair still matted with the rum spat on her by the university soccer team, Kelly looked down to see the off-green congealed mass of cask Chardonnay and a falafel kebab in the bottom of her lidless Brita filter jug.

“I thought, ‘fuck it,’ and poured it back through the top to see what came out. Lo and behold, my chardonnay was back in the bottom of the jug. It still tastes the same, but I like to add a bit of lemon to make it easier on the throat.”

“Thank me later, students.”

“They Can’t Run Without Heads!” Yells Antisocial Local Dad During U10s Match

TEXT:

After guiding the Mighty Dolphins under 10s to their eighth premiership in a row, club veteran and Betoota Mayor, Councillor Keith Carton has been criticised today for what many rival clubs describe as poor sportsmanship.

The BDRLFC board has today confirmed that Carton has been temporarily stood down and will be further disciplined by the Dolphins’ president, his younger brother Alf, at an internal club meeting on Friday.

The controversy arose after several parents overheard the Mayor’ halftime pep talk during last weekend’s grand final match against Cunnamulla.

“Boys it’s a tie at half time. You’ve got 20 minutes left of the season and I don’t want to see you lot going easy on these cornfed cunts!” he was allegedly heard shouting.

“I want you to get up and into ’em! If you see a hand on the ground, fuckin’ step on it.

“Ruck ’em, scrot ’em! Do whatever you’ve gotta fuckin’ do. Get round the neck!”

“Remember they can’t run without heads, boys!”

Keith Carton, a former roo-shooter and now full time Lord Mayor, currently holds the record for the most wins for an under 10s coach in the greater Western Queensland rugby league community.

However, the revelations surrounding his unorthodox style of game may spoil this great legacy, as competitor clubs talk about boycotting any match against the Dolphins until they can guarantee their ten-year-olds’ spines and scrotums will be safe.

Speaking to The Betoota Advocate from his office today, Councillor Carton says every cunt has gone soft and that it’s not wonder you aren’t allowed to send your kids to school with peanut butter anymore.

“I started coaching the under 10s in the 1980s when my son was playing for ’em!” he shouted.

“We play a different brand of football to what you pussies play and I’ve got more trophies for these little pricks than anyone else!”

“Go ahead, ban me from Western Queensland Rugby League, I dare ya,”

“Because I guarantee it’ll only be the game that suffers. How do you expect the Maroons to continue this legacy of dominance when the next generation is a bunch of anaphylactic pussies running around in cotton wool”.

Local Punter Doesn’t Know What Q&A Is, But Barnesy Better Play Some Of His Old Stuff

TEXT:

Tonight will mark the first time that local panel beater, Tony Manakis (48) hasn’t watched the ABC since they had sole broadcasting rights for international test cricket.

He says he doesn’t know too much about this Q&A shit, but if he was ever going to watch something on the public broadcaster again in his life, tonight will be the night.

“Barnesy never does stuff on TV anymore, but I heard at work that he’s going to be on with that bowl cut bird from Kath & Kim”

As Tony points out, Australian entertainers Jimmy Barnes and Magda Szubanski will be appearing on the Q&A panel this evening, but unbeknownst to the die-hard Chisel fan, it’s not very likely that either of them will be singing anything.

Q&A is an Australian television panel discussion program, broadcast on ABC hosted by news journalist Tony Jones. The show usually broadcasts on Monday nights at 9:35. Tonight’s episode has been organised in an attempt to win over our nation’s growing population of political imbeciles.

It is believed that Q&A‘s twitter account has gone down briefly, after an overload of requests for some fuckin’ Khe Sanh came from people like Mr Manakis.

“He better play some fuckin’ Khe Sanh” says Tony.

“I’ve already started tweeting the blokes at the ABC. I usually only use social media when the missus wants me to rinse those morons on MasterChef,”

“Play some of your old stuff Barnesy for fuck’s sake”

“Politics is fuckin’ boring he says, as a life long fan of Cold Chisel’s pub rock anthems, popular for their deep political conversations about Australian masculinity and working class ideals.

Man finds himself saying ‘fucking cyclists’ every time he gets behind the wheel

TEXT:

JOINING ARTHUR TALLON ON HIS morning commute was stressful enough, but what came out of his mouth was the hate gravy upon his roast of every cyclist we drove past.

“Just look at the cunt,’ he said.

The 43-year-old tax agent pointed with his hand outstretched as we headed toward central Betoota yesterday morning, past a lone cyclist who didn’t know if he was on the road or on the shoulder.

“Does he want to die? Does he want to get run over? Just look at the cunt!” Tallon grabbed the wheel with both hands and shook himself back and forward in a fit of rage. “And I’d be the prick if he went under my Tuff-bar and came out the other end a quadriplegic,” he said.

“I must say something like that once a day. I hate the fucking things. People like that should move somewhere where cycling is more appropriate, like the bohemian part of Morven or even fucking Cunnamulla. I don’t give a fuck.”

The systemic loathing of people who ride expensive racing bicycles has long been a part of desert life, with police receiving close to 900 complaints so far in 2016. What that number doesn’t reveal is that means every single cyclist in the Diamantina Shire has been abused, threatened or physically assaulted every time they got the bike out of the garage.

“It’s a problem that we’re looking to tackle in the future,” said Quilpie probationary constable Murray Glenda. “But it’s a long way out there just to investigate a crime against a cyclist.”

“We’d have to go out there if somebody died, obviously. But whenever the Flying Doctor is called out, we’ve gotta do paperwork. Most times, they just has a bad fall.”

Local Degenerate A Bit Excited By The Idea Of Strangers Looking At His Brazzers History

TEXT:

Local degenerate, Tyler Watson (35) isn’t really worried that nearly 800,000 Brazzers subscribers have had their personal details exposed in a major security breach, even though he is one of them.

The IT worker is well aware that the premium porn website has been infiltrated by hackers who stole the details of registered users worldwide from forums associated with the site on which porn fans discuss favourite scenes and performers. However, this severe invasion of privacy doesn’t seem to worry Mr Watson. In fact, it excites him.

The 9th-year fee-paying veteran of Brazzers told The Betoota Advocate this morning that after nearly a decade of intense browsing through the world of adult entertainment, very seldom does he find an MP4 that gets his blood rushing like it used to in his early days.

He says the idea of complete strangers reading through his search history and disgusting contributions to online porn forums gets him quite hot under the collar.

“I don’t behave on the internet, not many single men do…” says Mr Watson says with a cheeky smile.

“…and to be honest I’m kind of excited by the fact that a complete stranger can see what people like me are looking at. My porn collection is quite… diverse.

“These hackers could learn a bit from me”

With his left eye lid still twitching, Mr Watson then cracked his knuckles and giggled – before eating an entire handful of jellybeans.

“I’m a sick puppy… I want them to watch”

Mum Makes The ‘Run For Your Life’ Facial Expression As Dad Fires Up Boring Political Rant

TEXT:

Local mum, Olivia Mundey (58) has made a subtle attempt to show solidarity with her adult children, as husband John (62) launches into his weekly political rant.

The children Laura (25) and Samuel (27) are also trying their best to make sure dad doesn’t an unmanageable level of Courier Mail-fuelled rage as he talks about how Malcolm Turnbull is fucking this country up.

On the topic of climate change, and how the greens lack any form of empirical evidence that would suggest scouring our country for coal is not beneficial to the future of humankind, John says Prime Minister Turnbull may as well put on a fucking turtle neck sweater if “he wants to appeal to these stupid left-wing poofters”

“Turnbull’s too caught up in the political agenda of these homosexual chardonnay socialists rolling around Bondi,”

“Good riddance to that toffy little prick in Point Piper, I say”

“Who the fuck is he to say it’s Australia’s responsibility to deal with this climate change hoax,”

To avoid ruining Boxing Day, oldest son Tim Mundey has avoided mentioning the fact that 90% of Australia’s coral reef is in danger of being bleached to oblivion and the fact that Australia will probably have to home about 200,000 climate refugees from the pacific islands in about ten years.

His mum, who is never a big contributor to political conversations can see the self-restraint in his eyes.

She nods sympathetically, making sure John doesn’t notice.

After twenty minutes of a tense tirade, one that has seen John clearly breaching 18C of the racial discrimination act, he decides to tone it down and talk about how his children are finding life in the land of opportunity that his generation is solely responsible for creating.

“How’s life going anyway, pink shirt?” he says to Tim.

“Still blowing all your coin on coffee and the bloody facebook? pfft”

“And you lot wonder why you’ll never be able to afford a house…”

Tipsy White-Jeans Cougar At The Mooloolaba Surf Club Wants To Know Your Exact Height

TEXT:

CELESTE ‘CECE’ CARTER ALWAYS opens with the same line.

“You know, I have a son about your age,” she’d say to some unsuspecting young ringer in a fresh striped shirt his mother bought him for the trip down to the coast.

“Oh yes! My youngest son wants to go to Newcastle Waters! Do you know anybody there? It’d be so nice of you if you could put in a good word for him. He can’t ride a horse, but that’s not important,”

“Let me buy you a drink for all your trouble, you handsome young man.”

And that’s how she does it. The bar staff know it. Security knows it. His mates know it – even former Helen Springs head stockman Lincoln Humphries knows it.

For a number of years now, the 28-year-old Maroochydore-native has fallen under the spell of many white-jean-wearing cougars at the Mooloolaba Surf Club, who stand at the door to the petite smoking area like a pack of komodo dragons at the high water mark waiting for the tide to recede.

“They always ask me for a smoke as I’m heading out the door to the round yard, which is what we call the smoking area down the club because it’s tiny and they jam always you in there with bullocks if you know what I mean,” he said.

“We like to ‘draft’ the folk coming in and out of the door using our ringer lingo. Yelling things like ‘spay’ or ‘bush’ or ‘truck’ or something to that description. But yeah mate, that’s where they get you. In the smoking area,”

“Basically, the first time Cece got her claws in me, she bought me a few VCRs [vodka, coke and raspberry cordial]- next thing I know, she’s giving me a hickey in the pokie room while I’m getting features out of Pelican Pete like it’s nobody’s business,”

“Last thing I remember is trying to get my key in the door at the Nautilus in more ways than one, if you catch my drift.” he said.

Management at the Surf Club has said that while they want everybody to have the time of their lives while at the venue, they want all young bovine retrieval specialists to know the risks posed by 50-year-old divorcees in white jeans.

Betoota Races Soured After Mayor Is Caught Shelving Goey Into Prize Racehorse

TEXT:

The Betoota races, held over two days in our far-western Queensland town about 33 kilometres north of the South Australian border, are quite literally the only show in town until – until the Brophy boxing tent roles through in October that is.

With a spectacular turn out of roughly 6,000 people – our town has once again reaped the economic influx created by hosting Outback racing meets, with over six operational pop-up bars inside the track boundaries.

However it wasn’t all smiles and ribbons for everyone over the weekend, with the event being soured by the town mayor Councillor Keith Carton – who was photographed ‘shelving’ up to two and half grams of pure bikie speed into the rectal cavity of his own prize racehorse ‘Wake In Fright’.

The horse, which doesn’t seem to get much exercise outside of the annual event, has been winning a suspicious amount of races throughout Western Queensland over the last few months. Carton was arrested shortly after for animal abuse and race fixing.

The photo was captured by his stepdaughter’s friend, Kayleigh (17), who was attempting to take a selfie at the time, completely unaware of the shocking case of animal abuse that she had documented.

Councillor Carton was released from the South Betoota watchhouse this morning and has refused to comment on much. However he was heard telling racing officials that ‘every prick is fuckin’ doing it’ and that it was so typical of the bureacratic QLD Racing board to make an example out of him purely because he is an elected official.

However, as we have learnt time and time again, Keith ‘Teflon’ Carton has a way of getting out of sticky situations. This was clarified early last year during his ‘controlled fires’ program in the town’s south.

The revelations about Councillor Keith Carton aren’t the first example of race fixing in the Diamantina Shire, with the late publican Sigmund ‘Ziggy’ Remienko confessing on his death bed that the Betoota Hotel had been paid off as a result of him poisoning rival horses in the 70s.

Keith Carton’s estranged wife and town gossip, Shona Carton, has rushed to his defence.

“A man’s gotta make a crust somehow. He made more money as a fuckin’ roo-shooter”

“Nothing’s gonna stick to Keith. He’s the reason you [nearby police officers and Betoota Advocate editors] even have a fuckin job!”

Shock As Man Riding A Horse Wearing A Pair Of RM Williams Riding Boots

TEXT:

DOUG PARSONS IS THE TYPE of bloke who’d walk into any pub down in the big smoke and light up a dart. He walks through every door dick first and refuses to apologise.

When he’s at work out west retrieving cattle out of the bush under helicopters and around motorbikes, his weapon of choice has always been a trusty pair of Ariats.

But the 24-year-old has turned heads around the camp this morning after he was spotted sporting a pair of RM Williams riding boots on the back of an especially rank pony.

The classic riding boot hasn’t been seen in a stirrup for nearly a decade now, as the fashionable elastic-sided shoe has been relegated to the boardrooms and inner-city footpaths of our capital cities.

“Yeah moite, got a pair of RMs as me town shoes,” said Parsons.

“I dunno, aye. One of my Ariats have a hole in the sole and it’s been raining, you see. I’m sure that I’m not the only spoonhead who hates walking around in wet socks all day, especially when you’re in the yards getting tossed about by fresh bullocks,”

“So I popped on my RMs and went to work on this wookatook blue mare. Cold morning, but. She gave me a bit of cheek, rooting around on the claypan for a bit but she come good. But no wonder no cowboy wears these fucking limp-sided boots on horses anymore, they’re fucked. Not snug at all, if you had a big strong bastard that wanted you off, he’d fucking near buck you right out of your boots.” he said.

Parsons says that while he was pleased to be the first Australian to wear a pair of RMs on a horse since 2005, he doesn’t plan to ever do it again.

Good Bloke Lets His Mate Finish Highly-Exaggerated Story That He Was Also Involved In

TEXT:

Despite the fact that Ted knows Benji is blatantly geeing up his run-in with the Fortitude Valley police last night, he’s going to let this one fly for the flow of conversation.

As the boys get stuck into a few, the excitement of spinning yarns is turning into a subtle competition between Benji and their mate Pete – who’s visiting from down south.

Benji, knowing full well that Pete wouldn’t be able to clarify that he “nearly got arrested” last night, has decided to ‘add a bit of GST’ to the story – in an attempt to throw something out that no one else will be able to top.

The only problem is that Ted was there last night, and Benji knows this.

As the story veers further and further from the truth, Ted decides he’s not going to pull up Benji on his shit talk, opting to save the roasting for a bit later.

With an awkward glance towards Teddy before finishing the story, with what is now looking to be a completely fabricated punchline, Benji is relieved to see a look of ‘go for it’ in Ted’s eyes.

This is great news, as the 29-year-old bricklayer realises that he is now flat out lying.

“Wow,” says Pete, almost speechless after hearing that Benji ‘basically punched a cop’ last night.

“True story. All true” says Ted, confirming that he’s the best bloke sitting at the table.

“Yeah, it was wild,” says Benji, who now feels safe enough to take full creative license.

“And then we ended up back at a penthouse in the CBD and fucked like six Brazillian backpackers,”

“Shoulda been there, joog.”

App to prevent ‘accidental incest’ proves a hit with West Queenslanders

TEXT:

THE RISK OF WEST QUEENSLANDERS ACCIDENTLY sleeping with a relative or ‘family friend’ is apparently high enough to justify the creation of a smartphone app to help prevent it.

A Thargomindah-based tech startup has released an app that has the information of every person registered in the Maranoa federal electorate and how their families might know each other – or if they’re related.

Lead software developer Vaughn Rust said the idea was born out of an awkward situation that involved his youngest boy and his best mate’s niece.

“So get this, the kid comes back from the Roma Races with this bird under his arm and I’m thinking, ‘Fuck me dead, that’s Matty’s niece,’ and then the idea just came to me,” he said.

“I thought if there was an app that prevented these types of situations, it’d go off like a grass fire. My brother, for example, knocked up our second cousin in the 90s, but they found out too late to pull the plug on the bastard. The cake had already risen. We all thought it was going to be born with a club foot or something,”

“In the end, they had a healthy baby boy. He’s a bit slow and his favourite movie is Frozen. Bit odd for a 24-year-old stay at home son. Each to their own, but.”

After Mr Rust told his son that he’d just gotten a bit too close to a family friend, the blood drained from his face and he retired to his room. He later refused dinner and went back to lying face down on his bed listen to P.O.D.

Dad Expecting Daughter Gently Steers Wife Away From Long List Of Names Belonging To Old Roots

Local man, Jordan Javesa (36) is struggling to tell his wife, Angela, that the list of favourite baby names that she has chosen for their unborn daughter could easily be confused with a list of chicks he used to root.

“It’s really bad. I mean, she knows I used to get around before I met her. But this is another level,” he says.

“Literally every single name she has chosen belongs to a bird I rooted somewhere down the line”

While he’s not yet 100% certain if it will be a girl, his family doctor is saying all signs are pointing to yes. This is something that the media sales director from South Betoota is very concerned about.

“She’s really set on ‘Tegan’ – that’s probably the worst one as well. Tegan was the name of this inked up stripper I used to root on the Gold Coast”

“Every time Ange says that name I automatically flashback to 69ing in a dodgy motel room as a young fella. Imagine if that was my fucking daughter’s name!?”

“Don’t get me started on Hayley. I do not want my daughter sharing the same name as some chick I railed in a portaloo at Eagle Farm.”

While not wanting to cause any unwanted friction in an already very stressful time in the Javesa household. Jordan says he has one last saving grace to avoid having this conversation with his wife of two years.

“Yeah, I’ve never used the race card before… But if there ever was a time to use it… This is it”

As a second-generation Australian, Jordan plans on steering Angela towards traditional Fijian female names.

“She can’t really argue with that. She’s the one that took my last name.”

“I can probably get away with a Talei or Mana. I hope she can take the bait.”

Report: Girlfriend’s Gay Best Friend Getting Away With Some Fairly Controversial Comments

TEXT:

Local man, Troy Liston can’t believe some of the shit his girlfriend’s gay best friend, Ted, gets away with saying to her.

While tagging along on their weekly coffee date, Troy says he was blown away by some of the remarks he heard Ted throwing around in front of his partner of three years this morning.

“Obviously the context is a bit different coming from a flamboyant homosexual florist,” he says. “But never in my life would I even dream of saying ‘shut up you bitch’ to Leesa,”

“She’d hold on for that kind of thing for two months and kill me in my sleep.”

Troy says he was aware of Leesa and Ted’s unique friendship well before he sat through the two and half hour ‘catch up’ this morning, but points out that their gossip-fuelled exchange of insults were much more noticeable given the unnecessary earful he had received from his girlfriend after politely asking her to ‘hurry up’ before leaving the house earlier.

“I’ve noticed that her sensitivities appear to be quite selective. Ted greeted Leesa this morning by telling her that she looked slutty.”

“Then he told her that she was stupid for not remembering the name of his ex-boyfriend. She just responded by saying ‘shuttt up’ and giggling,”

“I mean, he’s got a fair point with some of this stuff, but a lot of it is borderline misogyny… ”

After being shot several death stares by Leesa upon the suggestion that maybe it was time to wrap up their coffee date and start thinking about lunch, Troy says Ted referred to him as ‘mouth-breathing cave man who was always in a hurry.’

Ted’s comments were met with a giggling reception from Leesa.

“I just had to cop it,” says Troy.

“If I even tried to join in on their ‘banter’ I would have left them both in tears. I’m just not cute enough when I tell people to shut the fuck up,”

“I could have lit them both on fire today but it would have been really weird If I joined in because I can’t pull off sassy”

Baby Boomers Glad They Won’t Miss Anything When They Take Entire Planet With Them

TEXT:

Local Baby Boomers, James and Mary Grant (both 65) say that their looming mortality is not a concern, because they aren’t going to miss out on anything.

“The way these kids carry on, there’ll be nothing left by the time we kick it” says the career barbecue retailer who doesn’t believe in climate change.

“All this lot do is whinge about not being able to buy a home… They spend all their bloody money on coffee and facebook!”

This particular generation – also known as ‘The Baby Boomers’ – have been heavily criticised over the last thirty years for their inability to look past their own retirement, which many of them believe should have been the day they turned 55. However, despite their sense of entitlement, many refuse to leave their high-powered positions in the corporate sector and free up the crowded housing market by retiring to the coast or country.

Dr. Braiden Youngen, an anthropologist and historian from the CSIRO, says the reason baby boomers are still in charge of the world is because they have instilled a false sense of importance into themselves.

“Many of them believe that they worked very hard for everything good in this world,” says Dr Youngen

“They are forgetting that the generation above them lived through a great depression and fought in two world wars. They even missed out on Vietnam. These are the ones that spat on the our troops when they came home,”

“They also forget that they are solely responsible for the global financial crisis in 2008, and the fact that it was through the help of Generation X and Y that both capitalism and civil order was able to remain relatively intact,”

“The most influential person on Earth, Mark Zuckerberg, is an entire generation younger than them… and most of them don’t know who he is or what he does,”

When questioned about their generation’s disastrous track record of destroying the environment, declaring unnecessary wars and warehousing poor people inside prisons – both Mary and James Grant refuse to believe that they are at fault.

“Everyone’s got a chip on their shoulder. All these refugees throw their hands up because life is too hard and wanna come here to bludge on welfare…” says Mary who has been a stay-at-home housewife since her first child was born in 1973

“Not to mention the young kids who would prefer to get hooked on drugs than to make something of themselves. Bloody spoilt,”

James believes all the ‘hype’ about climate change is just a result of generation X ‘uni wankers’ who are trying their very hardest to ‘not get a real job’.

“All these whinging greenies sitting around smoking dope and complaining about the environment… Go out there and so something about!”

Dr Youngen says it is very frightening to know that the anti-intellectualist Baby Boomer may have another ten or so years left before they are no longer in charge of the world.

“They are fairly stubborn and not very good at problem solving. The fact that they are ignoring the pandemic of melting glaciers and coral bleaching would attest to this,”

“All these people had to do in their lifetime was not get AIDS… and they certainly did a horrible job of handling things when that came around,”

With the Brexit vote coming down to a majority of 50+ British citizens requesting to leave the European Union on mostly racist grounds, and the American public laying wake for a painful election between two of the most disliked Baby Boomers in their country’s top one percent of high income earners, it seems the scourge of this particular generation is one that has affected every corner of the globe.

“I never had it easy!” says James, who bought his first house on an apprentice wage when Aboriginal people were still considered flora and fauna by Australian law.

“I can’t wait to take the rest of you down with me. If you can’t get off your arses and do something… That’s what’s gonna happen!”

REPORT: Referring To Parents By Their First Name Is Creepy And Weird

TEXT:

A new study by the University of Queensland has found that people who only use first names when referring to their own mum and dad are not normal.

UQ Professor Roald Blyton says that of the 4000 people surveyed, those who used the terms of ‘mum’ and ‘dad’ were 95% less likely to join youth-oriented political parties, and were content in living in sharehouses during their twenties.

“The other batch, people who refer to their parents as though they are close friends, are the type of people that have very specific coffee orders in high school, and criticise their own generation for being bludgers,” he said.

“If you ever see someone order a scotch while watching a football match, you can almost guarantee that they refer to their parents as Pete and Janette, not mum and dad,”

“I’m not talking about the type of person who uses their old man’s first name when they are trying to wind him up. I’m talking about the people who make a point of not saying ‘Dad’ because they want to look sophisticated.”

However, local man Hugo Hildebrand (27) disagrees. He says he has been referring to his mum and dad by their first names since primary school and doesn’t believe that he is any different to his peers.

“It’s rubbish, I am just like any other generation X – I just choose not to be childish and refer to my parent’s by their Christian, given names. What am I? A baby?” said Mr Hildebrand with whiney voice very reminiscent of Christopher Pyne.

“Sure, I might not really enjoy listening to music… and sure, some people might think that my love of birdwatching is a bit peculiar. But I am no creep!”

The groundbreaking report was conducted in partnership with the Betoota Brewers Co-Op [BBCO], an organisation aimed at helping young people gain access to the same financial opportunities as their parents.

“What we wanted to find out was why some young people pretended that they were living the same lives as their parents,” says BBCO director, Dane Leeston.

“The financial insecurity faced by young Australians is not an issue for these people, because their parents, who they are very close friends with, allow them to live alone in one of their investment properties,”

“Anyone who shies away from saying mum and dad are so concerned about appearing grown up, that they are missing out on actually growing up,”

“Every young person needs to experience waking up on the kitchen floor of their sharehouse with no car keys, wallet or phone – or having to miss paying rent because they got a bit carried away of the pokies.”

Flashbacks Of Horrifying D&M With Stranger Are Haunting Man This Afternoon

TEXT:

The squad began lighting him up on the group chat before the sun came up.

Not because he made an inappropriate pass at someone he shouldn’t have and not because he publically exposed him.

He blacked out, telling his friends he can’t remember anything after 5pm. He was on autopilot.

But the boys cannot stop laughing at him because, in the depths of his binge, he told a complete stranger about his strained relationship with his estranged step-brother.

“I don’t think I needed to put all that heavy shit on that poor bloke,” said 26-year-old city worker Jackson Bogg.

“God, imagine what he was thinking? I bet he thought I was nuts,”

“And now it’s all I can think about, the look on this blokes face the whole time. Fuck man, it’s haunting me. I can’t seem to shake the embarrassment. Fuck! I know this feeling will pass but Jesus wept, man. I feel really on edge here,”

“I just have to learn from this experience, maybe I might even consider taking a month off the piss.”

A QLD Health spokesman confirmed to The Advocate that feelings such as these pass and that the easiest way to remedy them is to hang on with both hands and take the ride.

Impulsive Friday Blow-Out Ruins Whatever Girlfriend Had Planned For Saturday

TEXT:

WAKING UP EARLY ON SATURDAY afternoon, 29-year-old Carter Stephens didn’t feel like doing much – in fact, he doesn’t feel like doing anything until Monday.

It feels like ants are crawling all over his brain. He’s almost convinced himself that he’s dying.

Thoughts of doing Dry July are crossing his mind, despite his birthday being in the year’s coldest month.

Stephens spoke to The Advocate briefly at 3 o’clock, saying the rest of his weekend will be filled with deep introspection, podcasts and general malaise.

“It wasn’t supposed to be like this, I never wanted it to happen,’ he said.

“But a force came over, all the voices in my head told me to go to the pub. The only way to make them stop is to drink my weight in $10 Tiger jugs,”

“What’s wrong with me? I used to have hobbies and shit. Sometimes, I’d even go to the beach from time to time.”

Stephens then shared his plan to spend the rest of his Saturday sitting in a lawn chair in the shower, listening to Currents with some expensive sunglasses on – as the warm water laps at his soul.

Report: Watching An Entire Episode Of Ellen Is The Pinnacle Of Unemployment

TEXT:

Local woman, Ashley Mapusua, says six straight days of watching the Ellen Show is enough for even the most uninspired jobseeker.

After a fortnight of unemployment, Ashley has finished watching ‘all the good stuff’ on Netflix and is now killing time by watching light-hearted American daytime television.

“It hurts. I lost my job as a sub-editor due to redundancies only two weeks ago…”

“I tried to get straight back on the horse and went out chasing interviews, but I ended up losing steam and here I am”

However, as dire as things seem already, Ashley says it’s not just her taste in television that is declining – her hygiene is as well.

“I had this moment yesterday when I was one the couch at around 2:30 PM”

“I realised I had a lit cigarette in my hand and I had only been awake for a couple of hours. I hadn’t showered, hadn’t changed clothes. I was so very, very unemployed”

With a couple of very unlikely job prospects popping up in the next week, Ashley says she won’t be living like this for long.

“Yeah, I’ll go over my resume again in an hour or so. I’m just really getting into the Big Bang Theory right now.”

Local Machine Hammers Entire Bootload Of Groceries In One Trip

TEXT:

Local woman, Deborah Farrah (45) has stunned neighbours today by transporting $300 worth of groceries from the boot of her Holden Commodore to the kitchen bench in one load.

The single-mother-of-three says its no big deal, and sometimes you just need harden up.

“Yeah, the fingers were hurting by the time I got to the steps, but I had to get dinner ready for when the boys got home from footy training, so I wasn’t gonna stuff around with two or three loads,”

Next-door neighbour, Andrew Hudson (38) says he has never seen anything like it.

“I’m pretty sure she had a whole leg of lamb in one of those bags. Not to mention a couple 1.25 litre bottles of Coke,”

“Good on her. She puts me to shame,”

“I’m flat out with a carton of grog and a bag of chips. That’s a fortnight’s worth of groceries right there and she just smashed it,”

Between working two jobs and playing the role of a full time homemaker, ‘Debbie’ says there is “no time for fucking around” – especially when she’s got to wash fifteen jerseys for the Betoota Dolphins Under 12’s and get them on the line to dry overnight.

“It’s just how it goes. I’m a lifter, not a leaner. I’ve definitely moved more weight than that before,”

District Man Has A Lot Of Teeth For A Smart Cunt

TEXT:

HE’S OFTEN QUICK WITH the jokes or to bludge one of your smokes, leaving many local Betoota residents wondering how he’s still got all of his teeth.

Speaking from experience, former smart cunt Gavin Cooley says by the time he turned 30, he only had three of his own teeth left.

“I made a joke about a bloke’s missus and he went out to his cruiser and came back with a length of reo bar and flogged me half to death with it,” he said.

“That was the end of that.”

But that’s not the case for current cheeky man Artie Bullhurst, who’s been making light-hearted jokes and derogatory comments about other townsfolk for years now – all without serious consequence.

“Haha yeah. My teeth are all a la naturale. Every single one, mate,” laughed the 26-year-old dental hygienist.

“Everybody around town thinks I’m funny. That’s because I am. They all know I’m joking when I make fun of them.”

One of the targets of his comedy has other ideas, saying that if he makes fun of his mullet or lisp again, he’ll be finding bits of his teeth in China.

Local drifter Michael Conoware also has a tattoo on his neck of a flaming skull, which is also another part of him that Artie likes to poke fun at.

“I’m going to make the local doctor earn his keep the next time I see the cunt,” said the convicted necrophiliac.

“If he flicks my mullet and says ‘I’m so scared of your neck tattoo’ down the pub again, I’m going punch him so hard in the forehead, his brain will bounce off the floorboards like a super ball.”

“Fucking mark my words, cunt. I’ll stamp his teeth out like I’m jumping on the cockroaches on my kitchen floor. I’ve had enough!”

Degenerate Boyfriend Declares Aesop Shampoo Makes For Decent Enough Body Wash

TEXT:

Local man, Charlie Belmont arrives at work each morning smelling like coconut and murumuru butters – and it has nothing to do with his diet.

Charlie is one of thousands of men around the country that douses his body each morning with expensive hair products that are not meant to be used as bodywash.

“I’ve got all these health and beauty products at my disposal. Why not go for the one that smells the best,” says the 29-year-old sports analyst.

“Why would I bother with the Imperial Leather or Pears soap when I can coat my rig in this silky smooth Aesop range,”

Charlie has been using his girlfriend’s expensive hair products to wash his body for a good part of the year – and he hasn’t look back. His girlfriend, Ella (28) says that she has reprimanded him on several occasions for wasting her boutique hair products by using them to wash his entire 110kg body, but says there is no point anymore.

“He refuses to stop it. He loves the stuff,”

“He’s even offered to replace it, but he never does. The moment he runs out of the shampoo he just moves onto the conditioner or the face scrub,”

“I don’t think he understands that these products probably aren’t the best things to be massaging into his armpits and crotch. But it’s all about the exotic smells for him,”

A 2015 study by the leading Australian consumer advocacy group, CHOICE, found that roughly 80% of Australian males would be more likely to use female hygiene and beauty products, if given the option.

Lead researcher, Dr Vita Maroni says Charlie Belmont is just one of many.

“What we have found is that most blokes, whether they want to admit it or not, would much prefer to use Dove’s female anti-perspirant deodorant than BRUT or LYNX,”

“Men are given very little options when it comes to male-oriented beauty products. Why would you want to smell like a generic ‘sports’ deodorant, when you could smell like rainforest fruits,”

“They have a just as much right to feel and smell beautiful as women do,”

Charlie’s girlfriend says she believes her boyfriend is one of the driving forces for this movement.

“He’s unashamed in his approach to silky and smooth skin that looks and feels great,”

“Even as a teenager, his mum told me that he used to steal his sister’s Impulse spray because it smelt better,”

Charlie says he makes no apologies.

“Who the hell is gonna tell me I can’t restore my sheen and softness while also improving flexibility and minimizing frizz?”

“Plus, if they didn’t want me washing my whole body in it, they wouldn’t have called it ‘extra-body’ shampoo!”

Australian Living In London Hasn’t Found Himself Yet; Not Ready To Come Home

TEXT:

THE LAST THING STEPHEN VICKER slid into the top of his suitcase was Paul Kelly’s Greatest Hits.

A couple months earlier, he’d sorted out his Youth Mobility Visa and a one-way ticket to London, thinking he was about to embark on the adventure of his young life.

When he arrived in London, he quickly found a job in a small marketing agency on the edge of Zone 1. It was even easier to find a place to rest his head – a place he found through a mate’s cousin who’d made the move a year prior.

The 27-year-old traded his Manly apartment for a ground floor broom closet in Shepherd’s Bush, a pill he said he was prepared to swallow.

It was all a breeze, far less difficult than he’d thought. But as he rides bleary-eyed on the tube to work each morning, he tells himself he made the right decision.

Because if he didn’t, he’d be on the next flight home.

“On my bad days, I just put on that Paul Kelly CD and lie face down on my bed,” he said.

“But I have good days, like meeting up with my travelling friends at Camden Markets or something. Taking my friend Harry on a walking tour of Notting Hill and Portobello Road last week was fun.”

On the whole, most of the time Stephen has spent in London has been great, albeit a few rather unpleasant times when the thoughts of home crept into his head.

Recalling an incident from Australia Day this year, he was handed the aux cord late in the evening, just when the drugs began wearing out. Rather than put something smooth and contemporary and smooth to round the edges out, he put on some Kev Carmody.

“Droving Woman brings the house down at home,” he said. “Not in London.”

“People were saying: ‘What is this shit?’ and ‘Somebody change it!’ I almost cried.”

His mum calls every Sunday night like clockwork. They speak for half an hour about things he used to find trivial and mundane, but now it’s the only thing he honestly looks forward to each week.

“The last time I spoke to Mum, I promised that I’d try to find time to come home for Christmas this year,” he said.

“I’ve already booked the ticket, but it’s a return.”

Job Application Ruined By Hotmail Account From 2003

Local man, James Wells (27), will not be making it through to the second round of interviews in his most recent application for a mid-to-high-level financial management position in a reputable CBD office.

The interviewer, Brian Campwell (58), says that while James’ past experience and tertiary education was up to scratch, he could not have possibly hired someone who had listed his email contact as [email protected]

Mr Wells says he had no idea that such a minor details on his six-page cover letter could have been the determining factor as to whether or not he got the job.

“In hindsight I should have probably just whipped up a generic Gmail account, but I’m just so used to putting the old MSN address down,”

“It really is an embarrassing nod to how much of a dorky teenager I was. I don’t even drink Bundaberg rum, let alone chug it. Not back then, not now,”

As a result of not acting sooner, Mr Wells points out that his outdated Hotmail account now serves as an index to his entire identity, both online and offline.

“I’ve got my Facebook, online banking, electoral role, Uber, Menulog, university and entire friendship circle all hooked up to the one account,”

“Nothing is worse than my having to explain my email to family members,”

“Like, do you reckon they actually think I enjoy sixty-nines so much that I decided to put it in my email address?”

Western Queensland NBN Internet Speeds Now Two Times Faster Than Australia Post

TEXT:

The former Prime Minister looked the Diamantina Shire mayor in the eye, shook his hand and lied to him.

In a part of the nation where you’re only worth as much as your word, Tony Abbott promised Geoff Morton that the National Broadband fibre optic network would come to the desert country, ending years of lobbying and campaigning for a fair shake of the technology sauce bottle.

But that was all bullshit. Until now.

The Turnbull government has made good on that promise, says Bedourie resident Gabby Dunkirk. This time last year, just sending an email was an arduous task. God forbid, she had to send an attachment.

“Last night, I was able to connect to Limewire and download ‘Sister Golden Hair‘ by America in under an hour,” she wrote excitedly on her Facebook account.

“It’s blown my mind. What next? I’m about to send an email to my friend in London! And it’ll only take a day to get there [laughs].”

These groundbreaking developments come from the SkyMuster satellite system being switched on in the past month. Since then, socks have been blown off all over the channel country.

So much so that startups and entrepreneurs are now looking at regional centres such as Boulia, Bebourie, Birdsville, Betoota and Bransby.

The first of what seems like many new companies to come to the area is Clemenger Thargomindah BDDO, which has opened shop in the suburb of Bransby, which is a bone-judderingly pleasant 300-minute drive from the Thargo post office.

Clemenger chairman Nathan Franklin said the isolation and beauty of the desert country are paying dividends when it comes to creative work.

“It’s such a rare place,” said Franklin. “Our lead creative out there is coming up with some real bankable ideas. He also loves shooting camels in his spare time. That’s one thing you can’t do in any other of our offices!”

Local Bransby outstation manager Greg Coleman said he’s never seen such life in the area – something he thought would never return after the Bank of Queensland closed down their Bransby branch back in 2009.

“While the branch wasn’t much to look at, just a bloke with a cake tin under a boree tree, it was good to have a banking service so close,” said Coleman.

“You could go down there and withdraw cash for races, rodeos and whatnot. It was a great service. Now we’ve got these flash advertisers in the area now. Should be good for the local economy that’s for sure.”

“Those cattle yards down there get used once or twice a year. When they do, the station manager often lands on the road, which is a hoot.”

DESPITE BEING ONE of the more quieter towns of the Diamantina Shire, 23-year-old Dirk Hampton was ticketed by an area constable yesterday after failing to cross Adelaide Street at the designated crossing.

“This is just revenue raising. Don’t the cops have anything better to do? Fuckin’ seriously?” he said. “In France, they have a term for blokes like him. C–t.”

Late last year, the local Birdsville Council decided to implement tough new anti-jay-walking legislation in response to a tragic accident where a visiting deaf Irish backpacker was knocked down by a drunk driver.

While the man later recovered, the Council said they had to act before it happened again.

Local Coward Lets Partner Read Through Entire Group Chat

Local man, Ben Gladstone is a coward.

That’s according to thirteen blokes in his secret, boys-only WhatsApp group conversation.

“Ben’s done mate. He’s cooked it,” says former-mate Ryan Wrigley.

“What the fuck was he thinking. It goes without saying that the group chat is secret mens business. It’s fucking sacred… He let his girlfriend read through the entire thing,”

“It’s all very incriminating stuff,”

Mr Gladstone has acknowledged his “royal fuck-up” and refused to comment. However, his girlfriend Ellie says she doesn’t understand what the big deal is.

“Oh my God. Why are they making such a big deal of this?”

“It’s so childish for them to have a secret group chat. Ben wouldn’t let me look at for months, but he changed his tune when I started leveraging him with sex,”

“I just wanted to know what it is that warrants over one thousand messages a day. Like what are they talking about?”

Another one of Ben’s former-mates, Charlie Duff says he is “fucking worried” that Ellie may have read a certain parcel of information that could very well jeopardise his current relationship with her best friend, Amy.

“There was about 300 messages dedicated to how all thirteen of us wanted to root the new glassy that works at the Commercial Hotel,”

“Things got pretty visual as well… Like, we were talking about HOW we would root her,”

“If Ellie saw that, and I don’t doubt she did, I am fucked. My missus has always been suspicious of our group chat,”

“What did he think would result from this? Ben’s one of the biggest sickos in there… I have no idea how he didn’t see that this security breach was going to be an issue for everyone involved.”

Ben, while very apologetic, says the group chat has gone rather quiet lately. He is aware that this probably means that another group chat has been created. Without him.

Report: Sniffer Dogs Are Fucken Dogs

TEXT:

Maitland diesel mechanic Trenton Derran has spoken out in a stinging rebuke of the presence of police dogs at community events on his Facebook page this Friday.

The young electronic music enthusiast controversially revealed that he was reluctant to carry more than six disco biscuits into festivals due to the increased number of sniffer dogs patrolling the entry point.

Mr Derran, 23, remarked that he felt the police presence had a direct correlation with lowered consumption – which resulted in a largely detrimental impact on the ‘MDMAconomy’.

“Where punters used to carry in enough shtingers[sic] for every other bloke and his pooch, now the coppers and their hounds have us second guessing a sneaky ten-pack” wrote Mr Derran.

“They are fucking dogs”

The well known community representative has received two suspended sentences in relation to carriage of illicit substances with intention to sell, and is reportedly fed up with giving up his historically loose Thursday evenings for his court mandated intervention programs.

“These days, a fella can’t relax with even five round ones at a festy” lamented Mr Derran.

“I generally just hook them over to my missus Krystalyce, who chucks them in a franger”

While much of the anger in Mr Derran’s shocking outburst was directed at NSW Police, the lauded commentator managed to take aim at the Federal government and Sydney’s lockout laws.

“I just wish those blokes in Canberra would take a breather and let the fellas live” decried a frustrated Derran.

“I used to be able to fund my own gear from slinging on the side, but everything is so tightly regulated now.”

“It wouldn’t surprise me in the least if that dickhead Malcolm Turnbull tries to legislate a eccy tax in the not too distant future.”

Hotel Staff Taken Hostage As Patrons Refuse To Acknowledge Lock-Out Laws

TEXT:

BAR AND SECURITY STAFF at Hotel Sweety’s in the Sydney CBD have been taken hostage in an apparent protest of the NSW lockout laws.

Three men aged 25, 23 and 18 laid siege to the hotel after being asked to leave the licensed premises at the closing time of 3:00 am. One of the men, Lachlan Peterson, reached-out to the Betoota Advocate via mobile phone to deliver a message and describe the events that lead to the crisis.

“It’s me brother’s 18th,” said Lachlan. “We’d caught the train in from [Doonside] which takes a fuckin’ hour, so of course we pre-loaded a case of tins in preparation,”

“Then we started smashing $11.00 Bundy and Cokes inside the hotel, 3:00 am hits and the next thing we know this fat cunt [security guard] is asking us to leave. I sat there for a second and thought, my pill just kicked in, fuck this.”

Lachlan, his brother and the third man then assaulted the staff, locking them underground in the cellar.

“That secca was big, but not big enough to take a shot right to the fuckin’ kidneys and keep standing,” Lachlan continued.

“After he went down we hustled the rest of the staff into the cellar, then we headed up to the roof to keep drinking. It was 3 versus 5, but a bunch of craft-beer pouring poofs from Sydney aren’t a match for any cunt from Doony.”

When asked what he feels is wrong with the NSW lockout laws Lachlan replied:

“Well, they’re bullshit. Nothing’s open out our way so we come to the city to drink and now we can’t even do that. There’s no place for people like us to go anymore.”

The lockout laws are notoriously unpopular with young people in Sydney and are up for a possible review later this year.

When asked what he thought would happen next, Lachlan gave a disjointed answer as our connection was cut; it is our understanding that police had breached the front doors of the hotel in order to rescue the hostages. The time was 8:34am

One of the men could be heard shouting from the rooftop bar, his last words were reported to be as follows:

“Get Mike Baird in here to sort this fucking mess out or fuck off.”

“Oi Everyone Back To Mine” Says Bloke Who Definitely Hasn’t Consulted His Housemates

“Oi everyone, back to mine!”

Those were the words that echoed through the smoking area of the local The Betoota Hotel at 2:00am on Sunday morning. 25-year-old Lewis Gurr says: “It didn’t look like anyone else was gonna put their hand up”.

“…plus there was heaps of white wine left over from my housemates birthday”.

It is believed that the local radio producer decided to host kick-ons without consulting the three people he lives with, in a heroic display of camaraderie.

“Lewis is fucked in the head,” says his long-suffering housemate, Victoria (23).

“It happens every fucken weekend. It’ll be 4:00 am and i’ll get woken up by his dumb-arse mates,”

“They bust into my room asking me for cigarettes…  So they can smoke them in my living room and stub them in the carpet”.

Mr Gurr has stated that he and his mates have difficulty with “calling it a night” – especially after the new management bowed to council pressure to close the doors at 2 am.

“[Laughter] Yeah, the pubs aren’t a safe bet anymore. It’s almost like they are asking you to leave the moment you drop your first dooper (sic). I’m just lucky that my house is the party-house” says Lewis.

“Yeah, things get a bit messy but, that’s life isn’t it? All a part of being young”

Lewis’ 35-year-old housemate, Pete says he disagrees with this attitude – but at the same time is very willing to join in.

“These boys keep me young. Nothing like turning a friday night drinks into a rooftop sunday session. Pineapple cruisers, the lot mate,”

“But yeah, when this shit happens on weekdays… it can become a bit too much. I’m a carpenter… I can’t be getting up that early if these sickos are flopping around on the suede couch, blaring Nickelback as a joke”

Hospitality staff beg heartbroken co-worker to stop playing “The Smiths” on cafe sound system

TEXT:

THE STAFF OF a North Betoota café are beginning to grow weary of one barista’s music playlist after the 23-year-old hasn’t stopped bingeing on The Smiths since breaking up with his short-time girlfriend, Angela.

The pair mutually decided to part ways after it was revealed to The Advocate that Harry Muller, the barista at the centre of the controversy, wasn’t ambitious enough to satisfy his “bae” of 6 days.

Although it’s not uncommon to resort to a “Smiths marathon” in the wake of such a traumatic event, his colleagues at the Gumnut Cafe say enough is enough.

Part-owner of the popular café and famed local sandwich maker Kevin DeShaun, says that while he “feels sorry” for Harry,  customers are beginning to complain about listening to depressing music while trying to enjoy their meals.

“Look, we’ve all been there,” said Mr DeShaun.

“Everybody at some stage in their lives, usually around the early to mid-20’s, goes hard out on The Smiths,”

“Heaven knows I’ve been miserable in the past but at least I had to common decency to do it in the privacy of my home,” he said.

Since the breakdown of his relationship, Mr Muller describes himself as being “devoid of reason” and a “bitter, hollow shell of a human being”.

However, while he regrets not showing more life during his relationship with Angela, he agrees that he’s grown from the experience.

“I feel like I’m dying,”

“To make things worse, I’ve started smoking again so I can sit alone in my room at night, listen to Louder Than Bombs  repeat and work my way through a fresh deck of Peter Stuyvesant classics,” said Mr Muller

“It’s not what I thought the future had planned for me but I guess I just have to make do with being ‘unambitious’ and ‘content with being a lazy piece of shit’ for the rest of my life.”

Listening to The Smiths has been praised by doctors as being a healthier way to deal with a break-up as opposed to more traditional methods seen in country towns.

Dr Patel Manesh from Betoota Base Hospital says that the young people in regional areas often use substances such as marijuana and crystallised methamphetamine as a crutch in their time of need.

“Harry is setting a fine example in how to deal with angst-fuelled spells of deep self-loathing,” said Dr Manesh.

“There aren’t any answers at the bottom of a cone piece, nor the end of a glass pipe,”

“However temporary the fix may be, there has been evidence to suggest that short stints listening to Morrissey’s nihilistic lyrics is beneficial in the long run,”

“Using The Smiths is a far better option for young people trying to get through a seemingly endless period of melancholy.” he said.

Although Harry said that “he’s never going to get attached to anybody ever again”, his friends are confident that he’ll shake off this current funk when another local girl gives him more than the time of day.

WALTER “WALT” MALLHOUSE’S life was perfect in every way.

He was one of the most respected members of his community and a successful grazier.

The people of Bingara, the town where he grew up and raised his family, all knew his name. His family has held on to their Merino stud, Earndale, through the good years and the bad. Walt’s superfine wool is known around the country and he’s even been featured on Landline before.

But earlier this month, all of that changed.

Walt’s wife, Abigaile, ran for mayor in the local by-election after the sudden passing of the previous leader. Mrs Mallhouse won in a sweeping victory, the first independent to be elected to the highest office of Bingara. At first, Walt Mallhouse was proud of his wife for winning by such a convincing margin – but now he wished she’d been beaten by a landslide.

Because now the people of Bingara are calling Walt Mallhouse, Tim.

“After Abby got up in the election, on of the boys down at the pub said ‘you’re just like Tim, Julia Gillard’s bloke’ and it’s stuck,” he said.

“Don’t get me wrong, I respect the bloke and all – but he’s a hairdresser,”

“I can see the funny side of it but it’s starting to piss me off a bit,” he said.

It’s not a term of endearment – especially not for a farmer.

“They can call me anything they fucking want. But it’s a worry that my entire identity in this town is now based around the fact that my missus is much more powerful than I am,”

Julia Gillard hasn’t got a very good name out in the bush, especially after the live export disaster – which cost thousands of Australians their livelihood and income.

Then there’s Tim, who as a hairdresser with a chequered past, doesn’t have a very good name in regional Australia either because country towns have barbers.

Nevertheless, Mayor Mallhouse’s victory has heralded a new beginning for Bingara, which has dropped in size and population since the decline in wool prices.

Mayor Mallhouse’s chief policies include providing concessions to small businesses to make sure they stay in Bingara and deregulating the Gwydir River Authority.

Her staff, which includes a press secretary and personal assistant, has already moved to their new offices beside Peckham’s Mitre10 and the Wu-Fung restaurant.

“We’ll see how it plays out,” says Walt.

“I nearly laid out the publican’s son yesterday. Smartmouth prick”

Man gets a root after using Wipe On Sex Appeal from pub vending machine

TEXT:

A VISIBLY INTOXICATED local man says he had intercourse with a transient woman after purchasing a pheromone wipe from a hotel restroom.

Witnesses say the man left the licensed premises with the woman at 2:45am EDST and was not seen again until the next morning.

“My mates have been shouting my name in funny voices and slapping me on the back all morning,” says the man.

“But yeah. It was good. I really gave it to her,”

“She took everything I threw at her. I even bottomed out a few times and it didn’t worry her,” he said.

The woman at the centre of the controversial hook-up says that she was drawn to the man, who she hadn’t previously met.

“He said “Hello” like he was going to put me through a wall,” says the woman.

“I don’t know what it was. But as soon as he wiped those pheromones on his neck and wrist, It sparked an animalistic fire inside me… knew I had to shag him… it wasn’t out of charity either,”

“He’s a shithouse dancer, a bit of an asshole and he kept interrupting me – so there’s no other reason why slept with him other than the Wipe On Sex Appeal.

As Australia’s leading pheromone whip, Wipe On Sex Appeal says pheromones are chemicals that send out subconscious scent signals to the opposite sex that naturally trigger attraction.

As their website claims, when a person “receives” the chemical-hormonal signals, they automatically, instinctively respond – without even realising what is drawing them to you.

The two have confirmed that they will not be seeing one another again.
