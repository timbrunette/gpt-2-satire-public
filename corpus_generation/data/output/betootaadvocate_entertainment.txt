Western New South Wales Receives 70 Millimetres Of Coalition Drought Policy Overnight

TEXT:

Large parts of inland NSW have been treated to a big downpour of Coalition Drought Policy overnight.

In some great news for drought-stricken farmers and communities, the parched areas of the state were blessed with a large batch of the government’s best drought policy.

After a big few weeks of claiming to be working on meaningful drought policy other than publicly stating they hope it rains soon, the Nationals were relieved to see ScoMo finally made it happen.

“Thank the lord for that,” said Nationals Leader Michael McCormack after Bourke got 66 mils overnight.

“That downpour of rain should wash away the whole drought issue for a few weeks at least, and buy us a bit more time to come up with reasons why systematic mismanagement of water usage in the bush isn’t actually our fault.”

“It won’t end the drought obviously, but it should stop people talking about it for a little while.”

“Ask and you shall receive aye,” said the Nats leader about the Prime Minister’s prayers for rain being answered.

One farmer from the Riverina explained to The Advocate today that while he is obviously relieved, he’s starting to get a little concerned that the Prime Minister might be starting to think he’s the rain man.

“Fuck I hope he (ScoMo) and McCormack don’t just leave it at that,” he said.

“I know they believe strongly in their drought policy, but one downpour isn’t going to change much. There’s a long summer ahead.”

ScoMo Calls For A Ban On All Non-Abortion Related Protests

TEXT:

Prime Minister Scott Morrison has today confirmed that he will be calling for a ban on all protests not related to abortion.

His calls came at a speech today, following weeks of disruption caused by environmental protestors who have been trying to get action on climate change.

That has lead to the Prime Minister vowing to take action against any disrupters and boycotters who aren’t trying to prevent women from having control over their own bodies.

“The threat to mining in this country comes from a new breed of radical activism,” he said today.

“A brand of activism that should only be reserved for vulnerable young woman trying to enter a medical clinic,” continued the fired up Prime Minister.

“So, while drought cripples the inland of the nation and the impending recession draws ever closer, the number one priority for my government for the foreseeable future will be protecting large multinational mining companies that don’t pay any tax and pillage the natural environment.”

“Because, someone needs to stand up for the little guys, the quiet tax-dodging conglomerates.”

“And I’m proud to say I’m going to do my bloody best to do that.”

Barnaby Frightens Life Out Of Angus Taylor By Turning Up To Halloween Party As Clover Moore

TEXT:

Barnaby Joyce sent Angus Taylor scuttling last night it can be confirmed.

The Member for New England caused the Energy Minister to trip over his own chair before scrambling out of the Coalition government’s Halloween Party last night.

The scene was met with raucous laughter after Barnaby revealed himself as the man behind the prank.

This comes after the water license’s investor Taylor was forced to ‘unreservedly apologise’ to the Lord Mayor of Sydney Clover Moore for using falsified figures to launch a public attack on her climate record.

It was revealed that Taylor’s office had relied on figures that grossly inflated the council’s expenditure on travel during the attack over Sydney Council’s declaration of a climate emergency earlier this year.

After initially intending to haze the under fire Coalition Minister with an Irrigation Water Meter, Barnaby said he was glad he went to the effort of dressing up as Sydney’s Lord Mayor instead.

“Holy shit, that was all time,” laughed the former Deputy Prime Minister.

“They way he spilt the beer all over himself when he was trying to run out of the room,” continued Barnaby before bursting back into laughter.

“Fantastic. Great move. Well done Angus,” he then said before losing control of his laughter for good.

Angus Taylor was unavailable for comment on the matter.

ScoMo Makes Sure He Gets Photographed Running Water To Everyone Except The Farmers

TEXT:

Prime Minister Scott Morrison has told the photographers shadowing him to take the morning off.

This comes after a couple of big weeks getting snapped running water out to everyone except the farmers and regional Australians crippled by drought.

After running water out to the respective Rugby League and Cricket teams he picks for one-off annual matches, ScoMo is popping the dress shoes back on and sticking the water bottle in the holster.

“Far out, how good aye,” said ScoMo to The Advocate this morning.

“Honestly, it’s an honour to be able to run water out to the blokes you know,” explained the Prime Minister who stole some Fijian kid’s dream when he ran water during the game in Suva.

Dropping water bottles and doing a similar job to the one he is doing running water out to the farmers, ScoMo explained he just can’t help that he looks like a daggy dad.

“Anyway, I don’t need to run water to the farmers, because the Nationals told me they are building dams!”

“And lots of em.”

“So, until I head out there for my next photo op with a farmer doing it tough, I’ve got other things to focus on, okay.”

Nationals Seemingly More Concerned About Pauline Taking Credit For Policies Than Drought

TEXT:

Despite the whole drought thing going on at the moment, the National Party have today confirmed that there is another issue that is slightly more pressing right now.

Pauline Hanson, taking credit for ‘their policies.’

Speaking from Canberra this morning, National’s Leader Michael McCormack and Deputy Leader Bridget McKenzie have moved to address their concerns about One Nation trying to score points off the back of ‘their policies.’

This comes after Pauline Hanson had a sit down with Alan Jones to claim she got the Dairy Code over the line, a policy the Nats had ‘been pushing’ but couldn’t make happen until Pauline started making life hard for the government.

“Look, obviously we are very concerned about the drought, and we are working on a lot of great policy on that,” began McCormack.

“But, it’s extremely important, that before we implement any of these policies after talking about them for an extended period of time while people on the land face the prospect of foreclosure, we get the credit we deserve.”

Mckenzie then interrupted;

“That was my policy Pauline and you know it,” said the angry Deputy Leader referring to Hanson’s efforts to get the mandatory dairy code over the line.

“Anyway, going on, it’s important that we get credit where credit is due.”

“Because getting the political points on the board is more important than the policy being implementing and having a positive impact on farmers livelihoods.”

Shorten Criticises Albo For Immediately Backflipping Instead Of Normal Gradual Backflipping

TEXT:

The Australian Labor party and worker’s unions have a proud friendship that dates back to the very first ‘hard hat photo opp.’

Now, however it seems that the in-opposition ALP may be forgetting their waterlogged roots as their support of coalition free trade deals have angered the famously placid Australian Unions. 

Sharing this sentiment is former opposition leader and professional ghost-at-the-feast Bill Shorten who claims this type of backflipping in unacceptable.

“Immediate backflipping goes against our beliefs as a party,” stated Bill Shorten while sitting on a Billie Eilish style tin billy cart.

“What young Albo-dore needed to do was toe the party line and gradually backflip.”

Shorten went on to describe Labor’s proud history of backflipping, citing the Encryption Bill backflip as an example of how to do so with dignity.

“I may have lost an election or two but Albo is backflipping like he’s Mundine at St George.”

“That’s right isn’t it? That’s a thing yeah?”

McCormack Excitedly Shows PM Where The National Party Are Planning On Putting All His Prayers

TEXT:

In a meeting of the minds, Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack has today excitedly taken the Prime Minister for a bit of a tour.

The Deputy Prime Minister and prominent God-botherer Michael McCormack has walked the PM around a rapidly emptying dam, to show him where all of his prayers can be stored.

McCormack has also called on the NSW State Government to immediately convert the Desalination Plant at Kurnell to an industrial Prayer Factory to solve Australia’s drought.

This comes after ScoMo yesterday told the nation that the power of prayer can help those suffering from drought and bushfires.

McCormack earlier this year suggested that existing proof of climate change couldn’t be trusted because, unlike the contents of the bible, early climate data could be inaccurate.

He then added that if farmers wanted rain they should pray for it.

Under the $17b plan, the current desalination equipment would be removed and replaced with two 45m-tall aluminium hands, which in times of need would be brought together by huge hydraulic rams in the internationally-recognised symbol of Christian prayer. At the same time, a 60,000W sound system would blast pre-recorded prayers up to heaven so that God will hear them and dispense rain accordingly.

“It’s very simple actually”, McCormack explained “The prayer power from these simulated hands is much greater because of the huge surface area. Plus when God looks down he will be able to see them much easier and the sound system is so much louder than all of the farmers praying at the same time. Not to mention that some people might be praying to… you know; another, ummmm, you know.”

The Deputy PM added that the new facility could also help disperse the rain when it arrived, as the giant hands could potentially be used to give rainclouds a helpful push to regional areas.

“It’s time to stop listening to scientists; the only thing they’ve given us is climate change, which is wreaking havoc, even though it doesn’t exist. The only sure-fire way to guarantee rain is to pray for it because that always works; eventually.”

Leaked Liberal Agenda Surprisingly Doesn’t Include Any Death Threats Aimed At Barnaby Joyce

TEXT:

In an embarrassing gaffe for the government today, the party’s internal agenda for the week has been accidentally sent out to the media.

The moment that will have the Prime Minister’s Media Advisor double-checking every single email and message for the rest of his natural life, has caused quite a stir today.

The internal memo with a list of talking points and party directives for the week was accidentally sent to the entirety of the Press Gallery, in a mistake that should make for an interesting few days of interviews.

While some were surprised about the severity of the smear campaigns being run internally inside the Liberal party others have been quick to point out how light the internal memo is on Barnaby Joyce.

Following directives on the importance of the economy and attacking climate warriors, only a single line was aimed at the maverick MP from New England who has increasingly made a habit of causing trouble for the government.

The line simply says: ‘BARNABY please keep on track this week.’

It’s not known if the memo was sent out before Barnaby called for Australia to come to the aid of Julian Assange.

However, the small throwaway line at the end has surprised many, who would have expected something far sterner in the memorandum.

“Yeah some of the other stuff is usually a fair bit sterner,” said an anonymous insider.

“I’ll try and get you a copy of next week’s one. If Barn keeps the Assange thing up it should be a doozy.”

ScoMo Gets The Advertising Gang Back Together To Brainstorm Ways To Rebrand Climate Activists

TEXT:

Prime Minister Scott Morrison has called on a favour from some old friends today to deal with the current Extinction Rebellion protestors making headlines.

The former ad man and head of Tourism Australia got the gang back together for a big brainstorming session on how to label the climate change activists.

“These are the people who brought you ‘How Good’s Australia’ and the ‘Retiree Tax.’ This is my select group of elite ad guys, so I’m getting serious,” said Morrison.

The activists protesting under the banner of Extinction Rebellion have ticked off a 3rd straight day of disrupting city commuters in an effort to achieve action on climate change.

That has led to ScoMo calling the guys in and buying a few packets of Tim Tams and some Snakes to ‘get the juices flowing on how to rebrand these leftie protestors.’

Allowing The Advocate exclusive access to the session Morrison said the most important thing is to make these protestors seems like militant lefties.

“We are just spitballing right now,” said an excited Morrison as he jotted suggestions on the whiteboard.

“No idea’s a bad idea. Except for anything that makes the people making an effort to try and prevent the extinction of life as we know seem normal.”

“Oohhhhhhh I like that,” he said writing out the suggestion to call them Vegan Homosexual Extremists.

“VHE’s! Love that.”

The session then continued for another hour or so, with Morrison now taking a select batch of names to some focus groups.

More to come.

Young Greens Vote To Dissolve After Finding Themselves Guilty Of Ageism

TEXT:

The infighters of tomorrow have decided to call it a day. 

In a recent summit of the Australian Young Greens, the youth political party voted to dissolve after self-alleged allegations of ageism in regards to the group policy, which states that members cannot be a part of the group if they are 25 years of age or older.

Young Greens leader Claire Satchel (24) states the group formerly known as The Young Greens moved to dissolve after they realised how non-inclusive they had been to anyone actually old enough to have a well-rounded opinion.

“We are here to face the big issues such as global warming and pill testing,” stated the now group-less leader.

“There is no room for us to exclude people who grew up with dial-up internet.”

Satchel explained how the decision was not an easy one with the group first considering to rebrand as The All-Ages Greens.

“But we thought if we did that Lee Rhiannon might try and use it as a way of sneaking back in.”

When presented with the news of his youth branch closing, Greens party leader Richard Di Natale stated he knew this would happen after consulting with his tea leaves this morning.

JoFry Considers Giving Everyone 900 Pesos In Effort To Be Remembered Somewhat Fondly

TEXT:

The Treasurer paused this morning to ponder the grim reality that’s dawning on him.

Joshua Frydenberg, known locally as JoFry, is in grave danger of going down as arguably the worst federal treasurer in living memory – and it’s not lost on him.

Despite his fantastic qualifications in business and economic management, being handcuffed to a regressive tax system that rewards the wealthy and punishes middle and lower class workers has seen Josh left with little option other than going with the flow.

As the economy slows and the country hurtles toward it’s first economic step backward since 1991, it’s becoming increasingly obvious to JoFry that he needs to do something to secure his legacy as a competant keeper of the cash box.

Speaking exclusively to The Advocate this morning via telephone, JoFry said he’s caught between a rock and bible place.

“I can’t renege on this promise of a giant surplus,” he sighed.

“But I know that money saving would be put to better use stimulating the economy and business, rather than being put toward paying off our foreign debt,”

“But yeah. We promised a surplus so we have to deliver one,”

“Maybe I should give everyone $900? Wayne Swan was about as qualified to run the economy as a discarded sucked mango seed on the side of the Bruce Highway and he’s remember better than Don Bradman. Bradman was a racist, by the way. He even refused to share a dressing room with Catholics,”

“He was a real piece of work and he’s remembered by history well. That’s what I want for myself. To be remembered for being a good treasurer.”

“Rules Are Rules” Dutton Tells Tamil Family With No Ties To Liberal Donors Or Crown Casino

TEXT:

Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton has taken the time today to explain why  the Biloela Tamil family must be deported.

Speaking on the Today show this morning, Dutton explained that despite the fact that the family is much loved in the small regional Queensland community, they aren’t technically refugees, and seeing as they aren’t connected to any of his mates, they can’t stay here.

“Rules are rules,” said Dutton bluntly about, Nadesalingam Murugappan (Nades), mother Kokilapathmapriya Nadesalingham (Priya), and their daughters Kopika and Tharunicaa.

Before their forced removal to Melbourne, and then onto the plane to Darwin this morning where mother Priya was reportedly hurt being thrown onto the aircraft, Nades had been working in the local meatworks, a job which plenty of ‘quiet Australian’s’ turn their nose up at.

“None of them are wanted by Interpol, none of them are wealthy Chinese business people or criminals, none of them are good looking young white women who my rich mates want as au pairs, none of them are connected to Liberal donors, and  none of them are mates with my mates,” said the frustrated aspiring Prime Minister.

“So the rules apply to them”

“It’s just they way these things are.”

“Look I wish there was something I could do, but until I get a phone call from Gillon McLachlan we are going ahead with deporting them.”

His decision to push ahead with the deportation of the family, which is currently in a final hearing this morning, could be put on hold at any time, as the Minister has the discretionary powers to allow a young family who are wanted by their local community to stay.

“I wish I could do something, but unless I don’t feel like adhering to the rules, I have to follow them,” he said.

“I don’t know why we are still talking about it.”

Former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has today made a public plea that his legacy not be forgotten. 

The handball enthusiast and current spokesperson on all manner of things has urged the nation to remember that he is the Labor party’s ‘actual China guy.’

This follows the revelation that a Chinese billionaire gave $100,000 in cash to the NSW Labor party and the continual murky dinners, ceremonies and meetings taking place between people well connected to the Chinese Government and federal and state politicians.

Labor Party Immediately Condemns Mack Horton After Recent Fundraiser In Haymarket Restaurant

TEXT:

In a rare showing of ALP unity, both Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese and every other member of the entire Labor Party have come out with condemnations of Australian swimmer Mack Horton for being a disrespectful snake Aussie kangaroo poo.

The Labor Party, who previously remained quiet regarding the Mack Horton protests, are now in full support of his Chinese rival Sun Yang – and have urged Horton to apologise

Anger towards Australian swimmer and prominent Gweilo Mack Horton has dominated Chinese social media for many months, with millions of people directing their fury at the Rio gold medallist over his refusal to share a podium after being beaten by alleged drug cheat Sun Yang.

Horton has long been critical of swimming authorities for allowing the Chinese star to compete after serving a three-month suspension in 2014 for testing positive to a banned stimulant, and last year smashing a blood vial during a dispute over the process of a random drug test.

While Mack Horton has received plenty of praise from Australian fans and other prominent Olympic identities, the ALP’s outspoken criticisms appear to have come out of nowhere.

However, many political analysts say it may have something to do with a recent fundraiser in Sydney’s Chinatown, where Labor politicians were wined and dined by prominent property developers and Chinese nationals.

This follows the new ICAC findings that Chinese billionaire Huang Xiangmo gave $100,000 in cash to a senior Labor Party official, in breach of electoral funding laws. The commission was told one witness, Quanbao Liao, took his own life in 2018 before giving evidence to the ICAC

The ICAC is beginning six weeks of public hearings to investigate whether NSW Labor received money from illegal sources, with many in the media speculating this brown paper bag syndicate goes all the way to the top of Federal Labor.

This appears unlikely, however, given that the Australian Labor Party’s website claims that they represent the Australian worker and no one else.

Except for Mack Horton, and basically anyone opposed to Crown Casino’s operations, and anyone opposed to the current international student-based funding model Australia’s universities are now solely depending on.

Busted Tablelands Farmer Facing Foreclosure Struggling To Get To Sleep Over This Abortion Bill

With his overdraft gone, bills up to his eyeballs and his property edging closer to the 90 days in arrears mark, the cattle farmer from the New England Tablelands said that’s those issues are the least of his worries right now.

“Despite the fact I’m going to have my place fire-sold to a mate of a banker in probably less than a month because of the rapidly changing and worsening climate in rural Australia, I just can’t stop thinking about the fact that abortion might be de-criminalised in NSW,” said Bill Walters.

“So that’s why I’m glad that my elected Federal representative Mr Barnaby Joyce is doing all that he can to get involved in a state legislative issue regarding what women can and can’t do with their bodies.”

This comes after Barnaby Joyce voiced a robocall urging NSW residents to oppose the bill to decriminalise abortion in the state.

“Some might argue that the fact that roads in the region look like a cheese grater, the public health system is fucked, the Murray Darling is as dry as the mouth of a Sunday Morning hangover and people are struggling with the reality of a crippling drought is more important,” Walters then went on.

“But in reality, a health issue in NSW parliament is the most pressing issue for me right now.”

“So I’m glad my elected representative is like a dog with a bone on the matter now.”

ScoMo Attempts To Impress Pacific Island Leaders In Tuvalu By Wearing OneFour-Style Balaclava

Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has today added his own urban flavour to his Polynesian experience during the Pacific Islands Forum in Tuvalu.

This comes as ScoMo vows to not shy away from the “tough conversations” with Australia’s regional “family” as his New Zealand counterpart Jacinda Ardern warned his government “will have to answer to the Pacific” on climate change.

While donned in an Island-print shirt and a crown of local flowers, Morrison made a point of showcasing his own understanding of Pacific Islander-wear, by chuckin on a bally.

While channelling that fashion of Mount Druitt’s superstar drill rap group OneFour, Morrison has also tried his hand at using some of the lingo he hears the Islander boys using in the sheds at Shark Park.

“Shot Uso” Morrison said to Tongan Prime Minister ‘Akilisi Pohiva, after being handed run-sheet for the Wednesday’s discussions.

Despite looking like he would force a shiv on an opp at any given chance, the Prime Minister is still facing increased pressure from Pacific Island leaders to sign up to a tough statement from 18 different countries calling for a global transition away from coal – due to the effects that the coal industry is having on the low-lying island nations to Australia’s north-east.

However, given the fact that the dow jones has today dropped 800 points and Australia looks to heading for one of the biggest financial crashes since 1987, the Prime Minister doesn’t look to be steering away from the economic sugar-hit of earth-destroying coal industry anytime soon.

“Australia has provided is hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to all you, this week alone” Scott Morrison said.

“Surely that’s incentive to shut up about rising sea levels… The coal industry pays my ministers far too much money for us to do anything about climate change.”

Morrison was then met groans from the audience, before losing his cool.

“Like…” he started

“Like who wants it?”

“Who wants war with Sydney’s realest?”

Manus Island Finally Evacuated After Asylum Seekers Promise To Spend Big At Crown Casino

TEXT:

The processing of the remaining 422 stateless asylum seekers currently detained on Manus Island has had been fast-tracked this afternoon, as Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton waives all security concerns and crammed them all onto a jet and flew them directly to Melbourne.

“We promise. We will gamble as hard as we possible can if you let us flee the purgatory of mental and physical torture at the hands of roided up security guards” said one former Iraqi brain surgeon who was detained in the offshore prison while attempting to flee ISIS with his young family several years ago.

It is believed every single on of the detainees – 213 at East Lorengau, 111 at West Lorengau and 98 asylum seekers at Hillside Haus – made a similar promise to Peter Dutton, after watching the 60 Minutes expose on fast tracked high-roller gambling visas, which was aired on Sunday night.

They are currently en route to Melbourne’s high roller suite and the controversial island detention centre is expected to be closed permanently later this evening.

This follows a the leaking of thousands of files from inside the Australian gaming giant, which show how Crown and its high-roller agents have encouraged and facilitated the travel to Australia of several figures of interest to police and security agencies.

Earlier today, the Federal Government confirmed it previously had an agreement with Crown Casinos to fast-track short-stay visa applications for Chinese visitors – in response to the revelations that were aired on Sunday Night’s episode of 60 minutes.

The files also appear to expose links between Asian criminal gangs, which are involved in high-roller junket businesses, and Chinese Communist Party influence activities in Australia.

The leaked data reveals that Crown had an “emergency channel” with Australian consular officials to fast-track the movement of Chinese nationals into Australia “where we may have hundreds of millions of dollars of turnover at stake” – and where visiting high-rollers are provided government aid to get directly from the airport to the Casino.

The revelations by The Age, The Sydney Morning Herald and 60 Minutes have shaken the casino giant. They also raise serious questions about state and federal agencies, including gaming authorities, and of course the competency of former disgraced Queensland police officer turned Home Affairs Minister, Peter Dutton.

Multinationals And Mining Sector Can’t Afford To Help Us Raise Newstart, Explains Liberal MP

TEXT:

A Liberal MP has taken the time to explain to the people of Australia why it’s just not possible to raise the Newstart allowance.

Speaking on Q&A last night, Senator Eric Abetz explained that the government would love to the Newstart allowance and help people doing it tough, but couldn’t because of the ‘burden of debt.’

Kindly taking the time to talk to The Advocate today about the issues, Abetz further clarified that there just isn’t money in the bank to help people living on $277 a week.

“I’d love nothing more than to provide people with a bit more money to survive on,” Abetz said.

“Hell, I’d like to give more money to school funding, the health care system, women’s shelters, homelessness support programs, mental health facilities and more,”

“But money doesn’t grow on trees, it comes out of the ground if you’ve been given free rein to pillage the country’s natural resources, or the ability to pay one of the big 4 accounting firms to funnel your money away into offshore tax havens,” he explained.

Referencing the estimated $50 billion a year in tax that gets dodged by large companies in Australia, Abetz explained that it would place too much of a burden on large multinationals and the mining sector if his government were to raise Newstart.

“The economic climate is pretty grim right now, and companies like Glencore, ALCOA and QANTAS are too busy trying to trickle down money into the hands of Australians willing to have a go.”

“So as I said, I’d love to do something to combat the rising poverty levels in Australia, but my hands are tied.”

Barnaby Joyce Adds A Promo Code To His Instagram Bio For New Teeth Whitening Product

TEXT:

The recently-povo former Deputy Prime Minister Of Australia has today gone the same route as any other public figure who is actually struggling financially behind the scenes.

This follows Barnaby’s most recent spate of headlines which resulted after he drew comparisons between his recent financial hurdles and the indignity suffered by those attempting to get by on stagnant welfare payments.

The member for New England, who is breaking ranks with his Reaganist coalition colleagues by calling for the rate of New­start to increase, earns a base wage of $211,250 and receives an extra $23,237 for being the chairman of the parliamentary committee on industry, innovation, science and resources. He pockets an electorate allowance of $46,000 a year, paid ­directly into his bank account.

It is supposed to cover the costs of travelling in his electorate for the year, but Mr Joyce is able to keep money he does not spend and the payment is not audited.

However, with six kids spread across two households in two different towns, plus a pad in Canberra, Joyce has had to look for other ways to earn a bit of side dosh.

Aside from his return-and-earn hustle, the Nationals MP is also utilising his 6k+ Instagram followers, in a micro-influencer capacity.

In his most recent Instagram post, Mr Joyce appears to be spruiking the benefits of a scientifically unsound form of home-teeth-bleaching.

“So a lot of you guys have been asking me how I maintain my pearly whites while also smoking a pack of darts a day and drinking roughly 40 schooner of beer per week…” reads the caption.

“Not to mention the International Roast I hammer at the driver revivers between my electorate and Canberra”

“Well, if you are like me, it can be really hard to find a couple minutes a day to brush your teeth. This is why I use for BleachedPeach teeth whitening”

While Joyce’s most recent influencer promo work appears like it may be veering towards grey-area corruption, the member for New England says he shouldn’t be criticised for promoting Australian-made products.

“These devices are all made from some Australian material-made, and boxed in Australia” he said.

“Use the promo code BETROOTER to get 20% off!”

This follows the news that Barnaby Joyce is doing it rather tough, claiming that a $200,000 plus salary doesn’t go very far when you’re supporting two families.

Joyce says he has even taken to slaughtering his own farm animals, living without a dishwasher, and buying a single coffee per day as a result of having a Catholic amount of kids in a relatively rural area.

He has also been forced to wear his older cousins hand-me-downs, and is now desecrating his government car with ethanol-infused unleaded.

The experience, Joyce said, has given him an insight into how tough those living on Newstart — who receive around $250 a a week — must be doing it.

“Running a car is hard enough in the bush” he says.

“But with 6 kids, two missos and an undying love for choccy milk – you’d be flat out getting to and from Canberra without a bit of help”

And by a bit of help, Joyce means a free ride from a local ANU student named Braiden, who has a spare seat in his 2004 Camry back to Canberra, after spending the weekend at his mother’s place in Armidale for her birthday.

“I’ve dehydrated some of this mutton” says Barnaby.

“It goes beautifully with a bit of tom sauce and and some white bread.”

“Oh sick. You’ve got a CD drive. Let’s get some Hutchence banging”

At time of press Barnaby was seen telling Braiden that he wasn’t that hungry while in the Drive-Thru at Merriwa maccas.

Barnaby Joyce Reveals He’s So Broke That He Has To Fill His Commonwealth Car Up With E10

TEXT:

Nationals MP Barnaby Joyce says his personal experience of struggling to make ends meet on $211,000 has given him a greater insight into the adversities faced by povo Australians.

The former deputy prime minister says that he’s been forced into some humiliating life hacks ever since his half a million dollar a year salary was halved when he had to stand down from his cabinet positions because he was doing things that directly contradicted his party’s staunch adherence to conservative Christian family values.

The Red Rooter says that he’s taken to turning off the heater at night, butchering his own sheep for meat and rarely eats out on his own dime to make ends meet.

In fact, things are so grim, that the member for New England has had to ask his personal driver to only fill his commonwealth provided vehicle up with E10 petrol.

“Do you know how expensive it is to be a young father in 2019?” said Joyce.

“Well, imagine being a young father as well an old father at the same time

“It’s fucken fucked”

The New England MP, who now has six children, also told the media that he is so ‘skint’ that he considers buying a cup of coffee a treat, like a normal person.

“Have you ever had to fly Tiger?” he asked.

“I have to fly tiger for every non-work-related flight. Which isn’t many, because I can justify meetings everywhere. But say, for example, if Vikki and I wanna take the boys to Coolum for the holidays, we have to now fly Tiger”“The fact that I have to spend Christmas at Coolum now says it all”

Frydenberg Hires Calombaris To Advise Government On Bringing Federal Budget Back To Surplus

TEXT:

Federal Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has today unveiled his secret weapon for belt-tightening, ahead of an imminent 2020 recession.

Speaking to a crowd of Quiet Australians outside of the Australian Treasury in Canberra today, Frydenberg delicately outlined is plan for smooth sailing through the eye of the storm.

“We took to the election our budget commitments and we have faithfully implement them. In fact, we have formulated a new system that will allow us to keep the government in the black without ever having to tax any companies ever again!”

“Ladies and Gentlemen, let me introduce to you, George Colambaris!”

Colambaris was met with a light applause by the crowd, made up of every day Australians who just want to get on with their lives without the government getting in the way with their red tape and legal templates aimed at making it harder to treat poor people like shit.

This follow’s the NAB’s June announcement that Australia’s retail sector already in recession and some economists fear the entire economy could next year fall into recession, ending the country’s much-vaunted 28-years of economic growth.

Frydenberg says the best way for the economy to keep moving is for big business to not have to pay their workers that much money, and in turn, dropping the prices on their products.

But that’s not all he’s planning on doing. Frydenberg says

“We can do all that while paying down debt, it’s important to create these buffers. And we will be doing that by not paying our CSIRO staff or any of the unskilled workers cleaning toilets in government buildings” he said.

“This is why I have brought big Georgie here in as an advisor”

“He’s gonna help me find the money that would otherwise be wasted on paying other humans a liveable wage”

“This black armband view of livability is destroying our economy. If it’s not housing affordability, it’s people whingeing about stagnant wage growth”

“It’s time to tighten the belt. It’s time to raise some Hell [enic republic]”

“hahaha”

ScoMo Orders Dutton To Ban Tomic From Re-Entering Australia After Blatantly Not Having A Go

TEXT:

Prime Minister Scott Morrison has today fronted the media to call for an urgent intervention on border policy.

The Member for Cook did so by publicly ordering Peter Dutton to ban tennis player Bernard Tomic from re-entering the country after he blatantly ‘refused to have a go.’

This comes following the much-maligned Gold Coast boy’s dismal effort in the first round of Wimbledon, where he went out in straight sets and 58 minutes (the second shortest men’s match in Wimbledon history).

That effort has seen the young man fined 45,000 pounds for not meeting the ‘required professional standard.’

But, refusing to try as hard as he can at hitting a ball over a net in a game of sport could cost the young man a lot more, with the Prime Minister labelling Tomic ‘unAustralian,’ today.

“And for that reason, he shouldn’t be allowed back into the greatest country on earth,” said Morrison.

“If you have a go, you’ll get a go, I think that’s pretty well documented, and if you don’t have a go, well we don’t want you here.”

“I’ve told Peter (Dutton) to cancel Thomas the Tank Engine’s passport.”

Dutton was unavailable to comment on the issue as he was helping his wife out with the books on her child care centres, but has promised he will release a statement later today.

More to come.

Bob Puts A Hole Through The Tele After Trailer For New Alligator Themed Movie Pops Up

TEXT:

Maverick North
Queensland MP caused quite a scene at a local hotel last night.

The Member for Kennedy did so at a motel in
Longreach when he let off a round in his hotel room.

Waking sleeping patrons in the rooms alongside
him, Bob, who famously doesn’t watch the news, but prefers to watch a movie
before he pops off to sleep at night, fired a single shot into his television
when a trailer for the new movie Crawl appeared on his screen.

Speaking to The Advocate a few moments ago out the front of the motel, Katter
explained that he had dozed off half to sleep during one of the Bourne movies
when all off a sudden he saw a ‘croc.’

“You see, I was dozing off there, as I like to
do, I mean I’ve done that since I was a young lad back at the old place because
I always wake early, and then throughout the day I’m always on my feet, so I do
get quite tired you see,” began Bob, using multiple sentences to convey what
could be said in a few words, as he normally does.

“And lo and behold, I was a bit dazed and I
thought I saw a croc, so I pull out my gun, which they wouldn’t like down South
would they, I mean I’ve carried this thing for as long as I’ve been travelling
this country for, but there’d be plenty out there who’d have a big boo hoo
about it and want to take it off me, but anyway so I thought there was a croc
in the room and I just bloomen opened fire on the thing.”

Bob then confirmed that it turned out it was
just a trailer for a new movie CRAWL, that flashed up on the ‘tele,’ which
doesn’t even have crocs in it anyway, as it’s an alligator theme creature
feature, but it was enough to send him off. 

“It’s all gators over there (the US) you see,
but anyway looks like a good one to go have a look at. I love getting down to
the movies once a month to go and see something. I always get a Choc Top too
let me tell you. But, this CRAWL movie looks like it’s full of seasonal
Townsville weather and toothed reptiles trynna take human life. Anyone that
wants to put a couple of hot ones into a gator, or a reptile like that’s gonna
get me on side.”

“If it was up to me I’d bloody deal with the
crocs up in the north here, but I hope they deal with ‘em in the movie, just
put a few bullets in the mongrels.”

Bob then continued on for about half an hour
in some nonsensical ramble, before our reporter eventually managed to get away.

It can be confirmed that no one was hurt by the gunshot as it dislodged in a beam behind the TV.

The movie in question, Crawl is in Cinemas July 11, and Bob has refused to confirm or deny whether he will steer clear.

Dutton Assures Reporters That It’s His Mates That Benefit From Big Childcare Contracts, Not Him

TEXT:

Peter Dutton has moved to uncross the wires of a few journalists this afternoon, after being questioned about his eligibility to sit in parliament.

Seeking to clarify the whole issue regarding him potentially not being constitutionally allowed to sit in parliament because he might benefit from the large child care centres operating out of a trust in his wife’s name, the Member for Dickson took some time to explain where everyone was getting mixed up.

“I’m all good to sit in parliament and my colleagues should continue pretending like this isn’t an issue that should potentially be examined, because it’s my mates who get the big childcare contracts, not me,” laughed Dutton this afternoon.

“I see where you’ve got yourselves all tangled up, and so I’m helping you untangle them so I don’t have to send in the Feds later on.”

“The big child care contracts are to my mates at Canstruct International to run Nauru, where we look after the kids, so you don’t have to worry about all the other stuff.”

Dutton then explained that it was all good that Canstruct International, a Brisbane-based firm and Liberal donor, who reportedly bid for the lucrative government contract to run the Nauru detention centre in 2017, despite no real experience in the area got the contract despite being the only tender in the process.

“Look I know everyone loves a story, but this is just Malcolm Turnbull trying to share some of his sour milk around with you all.”

“Let’s just forget about it and move on, I’m an eligible Parliamentarian and that’s the last I’ll be talking about it.”

“Under his eye,” he said before walking off.

Albo Begins Long Journey Towards Winning Back Voter Trust By Asking If Anyone Has Lost A Bag

TEXT:

Anthony Albanese has today made small steps towards winning back the voters that Labor lost to poorly articulated policy and uninspiring campaigning during the 2019 Federal Election.

The Labor leader-elect was in Caboolture on Tuesday to start his listening tour of the Sunshine State, where he began efforts to rebuild trust with the voter base.

“I wouldn’t usually do this… But has anyone lost a bag” asked the Member For Grayndler during a press conference at a prominent North Brisbane Leagues Club.

“One of my staffers found it in the bathrooms and it’s like a point eight at least. Would be spewing if you lost this”

Even the blatantly pro-Liberal media scrum appeared astounded by this level of honesty from the Labor leader, with many noting that if it had been them that found a full bag – they’d definitely be keeping a lid on it.

“What a good bloke” said one reporter for the Sunshine Coast Daily

“Unbelievable. I would have taken that bad boy straight into the pokies and started keying up”

It is believed that the mysterious bag was claimed discreetly by a nearby talkback radio field reporter, who thanked Albanese profusely, before offering him a slug.

“No thanks mate. Not really my bag” he said.

“Pardon the pun”

The crowd laughed hysterically before Albanese did the petty drug user one last favour.

“Actually, I wouldn’t be waving that around much longer I think one of those snitches at Channel 9 have called the cops”

“Hit the back door, I’ll stall them on the way in”

‘Albo Isn’t The Right Person To Lead’ Says Man Who Just Lost An Unloseable Election

TEXT:

Seemingly unaware that he lost the Labor Party two elections as leader, and arguably more as self-anointed factional heavy, Bill Shorten has today come out to rubbish Anthony Albanese’s leadership credentials.

Disregarding the fact that nearly everyone in the country is completely disregarding anything he says, the man who found a way to lose what was dubbed an unloseable election has explained that Albo shouldn’t be in the party’s top job.

The comments come as a show of affection for the man that loyally stood by him while he took a flame thrower to the Labor party’s chances of winning government for 6, potentially 10 years.

In the wake of his appalling defeat, Shorten has decided to pipe up with the comments, rather than just keep his running program up and slide out of the limelight for the good of his party and the Australian people.

“Yeah, I made a few calls, what of it,” said Shorten to The Advocate over the phone a few moments ago.

“I don’t care if the Australian people don’t want to hear from me, or me to call the shots, I’m going to give my unwanted opinion and go back to pulling strings behind the scenes despite forgoing that right 6 years ago for an ego-driven shot at fame,” he said.

“I think ideally what we should do is cool off for a few weeks and then I’ll have another bite at the cherry. Because instead of stepping aside and allowing someone who actually connects with the Australian public a go, like maybe I should have done a few years ago, I’m going to keep pursuing my dream.”

“To become the Prime Minister.”

Carlton Sign Bill Shorten As Club’s Runner

TEXT:

In some breaking news out of our country’s most cosmopolitan city, Bill Shorten has just announced his next career move.

After somehow losing last weekend’s election, the former Labor Party leader is set to find his feet at the Carlton Football Club as their runner.

A runner in AFL is a club official whose job is to run onto the ground to give the players messages from the coach during play.

The perfect marriage of mediocrity comes at a crisis point for both parties, with Carlton hopeful the signing might win them a couple more games this season.

While it’s not known how the Member for Maribyrnong’s parliamentary responsibility will be affected by the role, the Big Bang and How I Met Your Mother enthusiast said he is looking forward to getting into it.

“Obviously this weekend was pretty tough, and I don’t want to talk about it to be honest,” Shorten said to us today.

“But yes, this runner job is very exciting.”

“As the country is well aware, I enjoy running very much. And this new job is a great opportunity.”

“And I’m now very good at losing, so I’ll fit right in with the club culture hear at Carlton.”

“I’m already working on a career assassination of Patrick Cripps in an effort to take his job.”

Barnaby Reportedly Toying With The Idea Of Focusing On Policy This Parliamentary Term

TEXT:

In some breaking news out of the northern tablelands of NSW, it can be confirmed this afternoon that Barnaby Joyce is in fact considering working on some policy over the next couple of years.

Returning as the Member for New England off the back of overwhelming support from the electorate, the former leader of The Nationals says he going to come up with a few gems this term.

Speaking exclusively with The Advocate today, Joyce assured us that he definitely won’t spend the immediate future figuring out to politically assassinate the current Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack. 

“No way, Michael has my full support, and I back the bloke one hundred percent,” said Joyce containing his attempts to burst into laughter.

“I don’t want the top job ever again, I’m just here to work hard for my constituents and work up policy that makes Australia a better place,” he said.

“I’m going to figure out a way to fix the Murray Darling basin plan and all of the issues around water buybacks, irrigation rights, and the long term sustainability of the basin.”

“Oh no, that’s right, I can’t do that actually,” explained the Member for an electorate that regularly battles crippling droughts.

“Given all that stuff you know.”

Joyce then paused.

“Given the more frequent and increasing nature of drastic weather events that affect the economic viability of our electorate and farmers ability to sustainably generate income in the bush, I’ll start working on a policy to help deal with that,”

“Fuck,”

“I can’t do that either my hands are tied on that on too,” he said referencing his party’s stance on climate change and caring for the environment.

“I’ll get some funding for a new fucking Skate Park down in South Tamworth alright.”

“Maybe I’ll come up with some other stuff too.”

“This is the time for policy. 2016 was Johnny Depp, 2017 was the dual-citizenship, 2018 was the baby mama drama…”

“2019 will be the real deal. Just you watch!”

Ms Lambie has already warned the Coalition would need to treat her “a hell of a lot better” this time around.

Spunky suburban mothers around the apple Isle are reportedly cheering today, after successful getting one of their own in the Upper House.

One Nation Voter Says Pauline Is Only Person That Truly Understands Her Apart From Bliss N Eso

TEXT:

A young Betoota Heights woman has sat down with The Advocate today to explain to us just why neither of the major parties are appealing to her this election.

Kirra-Lea Sims told us ‘she’s had it up to here with politics.’

“It’s like Bliss n Eso once famously said, ‘It’s like this land is either run by Labor or Liberal. But don’t get it twisted they’re the same as the criminals,” she rapped to us.

Sims then explained that this year is the first time in four elections she has actually been enrolled to vote, and she’ll be making it count.

“Well, we live in a democracy, right? So I’m going to be voting for someone who actually speaks for me?” she said.

“And seeing as MC’s Bliss and Eso don’t have a political party, I’ll be voting for Pauline.”

“I was gonna vote Clive, but I don’t think I can trust him.”

Sims who works at as an accountant in the Heights explained that she’s seen first hand what’s happening to Australia, and while she isn’t quite sure what to pin it on, she has a fair idea that migrants might be to blame.

“This country is going to the dogs. Living and working conditions are going down the gurgler faster than the runoffs of fake tan at the Royal Handmaids School in the Grove.”

“And rather than spending some time thinking about why that might be the case, I’m happy to just blame it on migrants who have darker skin than me, women fleeing domestic violence and people on welfare.”

Uncle Tony X Completes TAFE Course For New Job Filming Hip Hop Videos In Remote Communities

TEXT:

Former Prime Minister and respected Northern Beaches community elder, Uncle Tony X has today completed his Cert III in VIS (Vague Indigenous Stuff).

This comes as the The most-likely-outgoing Member for Warringah prepares himself for a transition into new employment opportunities.

Uncle Tony’s dedicated work as a white man patronisingly applying band-aid solutions to deeply entrenched social disadvantage in the Aboriginal community has been recognised around the country, ever since he gave a conditional yes to taking on the job of the Federal Government’s Indigenous envoy.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison did not ask Mr Abbott to be a minister in his new Government, but instead asked him to take on the role of envoy, citing his close association with Aboriginal Australia after growing up in a six bedroom mansion in Sydney’s Northern Beaches and working for the Liberal Party for nearly three decades.

However, with the Independent candidate for Warringah, Zali Steggall, looking more and more likely to take Uncle Tony’s job – the Special Envoy has been forced to explore other employment opportunities for white guys who are apparently ‘really good with the blackfellas’.

While Uncle Tony says the obvious end game is to land a job lecturing other white people about Aboriginal Affairs at Sydney University – right now he’s going to have to settle for filming hip hop videos with the jarjums in Outback communities he’s previously had nothing to do with.

“Ayee look out” says Uncle Tony, while filming a bunch of youngsters dancing traditionally, which he will eventually overlay with a garage-band sounding beat from a drum machine.

Bill Shorten Shows Off How Multicultural He Is By Ordering A Panini At Subway

The leader of the Opposition and How I Met Your Mother Enthusiast Bill Bradbury Shorten has today decided to jazz things up a little bit.

Our country’s likely next Prime Minister (as long as he doesn’t Hillary Clinton this Steven Bradbury) Shorten said he was feeling like living a little spontaneously this afternoon.

Not spontaneously in the sense that he would be doing something like coming out and condemning the impending environmental disaster that is the Adani coal mine, or speaking off script at one of the day’s press conferences, but by mixing it up for lunch.

Popping into a Subway on the campaign trail in an effort to seem like an everyman, Bill Bradbury spent a few moments pondering what he should get on his Footlong Sub.

Deciding to just go for it, Shorten decided to step outside his comfort zone and ask for mayo on his tuna sandwich, and asking for it to be a panini, surprising his onlooking staffers.

“Yep, sometimes I’m a bit crazy like that,” said Shorten to us just moments ago.

“Normally I’m just a plain tuna and lettuce kind of guy, but today I went a bit rogue,” he laughed, failing to see anything particularly odd in the fact he doesn’t consider any of the raft of other meats, salads and condiments like everyone else does.

“Can I tell you a secret?” he then asked.

Our reporters nodded and encouraged him to fire away.

“I actually can never finish a Footlong,” he whispered looking around the restaurant.

“But given I’m a union man, and I’m supposed to be a ‘bloke’ and an everyman and all that, I feel too embarrassed to order a 6-Inch, so this panini thing is the perfect out, without making me look soft because I can’t eat a whole Footlong.”

The Nightwatchman Unveils “I’m Living In The 70s” By Skyhooks As Official Campaign Song

TEXT:

The Office of The Nightwatchman has today confirmed, that after some deliberation they have finally decided upon their official campaign song for the 2019 election.

After a long night surfing Spotify, with ‘Boys Light Up,’ ‘Lead Me To The Cross’ and ‘Be Faithful’ all vying for the official song, the Skyhooks classic number ‘I’m Living In The 70’s’ was confirmed the winner in the early hours of last night.

Speaking to us over the phone this morning, the Nightwatchman Prime Minister explained that for obvious reasons the Fatman Scoop tune, and the Hillsong hit ‘Lead Me To The Cross’ could land him in a bit of trouble, so he went for the surefire Skyhooks tune.

“It’s just so relevant for our party and our base this campaign,” said an excited Nightwatchman ahead of the official campaign launch tomorrow.

“Given our policies on all sorts of things, like the environment and people who aren’t white for example, the song is the perfect accompaniment to our campaign.”

“And hopefully it reminds all of our base about the good old days when you could say racist things without fear of retribution, desecrate the environment and the world was a much simpler place with our place.”

The Nightwatchman then explained that he’s even thinking about doing a parody of the song to make it even more relevant for a bit of a laugh.

Two former Prime Ministers have spent some time exchanging a few battle stories and having a laugh this past weekend.

In a sign of how scared the Labor party are that Bill Bradbury Shorten could fuck this up, senior figures successfully convinced Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard to present a united front this weekend, smile for the cameras and endorse the aspiring Prime Minister.

However, while the two figures are the political embodiment of Darius Boyd and making a one on one tackle, the mortal enemies decided to bury the hatchet that Bill Shorten had help bury into each of their backs with a few laughs.

Taking a moment before the official proceedings kicked off, the two former PM’s who actually had some charisma and ideals reportedly lifted the rear of their shirts too show off the huge scars from when they stabbed each other in the back.

“[Haha] Kevin, Bill Brutus Shorten really didn’t miss with that second one did he,” laughed Gillard and motioning to the second, larger, scar.

“Yeah, yours has healed up alright,” replied Rudd.

“Maybe the fact that you actually walked away from politics gracefully, continued trying to make a positive impact on things that you believe in and didn’t let your ego drive you to constantly undermine anyone still in the party like most politicians who don’t leave on their own terms do really helped the healing process.”

“And Bio Oil,” laughed Gillard referring to the popular product used to heal scars.

“Et tu, Bill” she chuckled.

Liberals Ask Man Midway Through Abusive Public Transport Rant If He’d Like To Be A Candidate

After being wound up by a few commuters on the bus this morning, an angry boomer has received some interesting news.

Midway through a racist, homophobic and sexist tirade, the man was offered the opportunity to run as a candidate for the Liberal Party, in following with the nature of some of the candidates who’ve been making news in the last few days.

The 69-year-old retired accountant, Ray Ceste-Kent, who usually drives into town but decided to get the bus today, was midway through abusing one of our town’s immigrants when he received the huge phone call.

Initiating the offensive and disgusting rant which will have the police knocking on his door later this afternoon, Ceste-Kent had to pause midway through a lecture on ‘Australian values’ to take a phone call from the Prime Minister.

Pausing the abuse aimed at a university student who was born and raised in Betoota but isn’t caucasian, the old man who struggles for a meaningful relationship with his son who he refuses to acknowledge is gay, had to take stock of who was on the other end of the line.

“Gday mate, Scott Morrison here, but you can call me Sco-Mo bloke,” the Prime Minister laughed.

“Now, I know you’ve got some interesting views, we’ve seen that on your’s and Cherryl’s Facebook and we had an interesting proposition for you,” he continued.

“How’d ya like to be a Member of Parliament mate,” he said like he was a coach of a professional football team re-enacting the offering of a young player a contract for the social media team to film.

Ceste-Kent, initially shocked said he would love to, but he’d have to have a chat about it with the ‘ball and chain’ – an microaggressive reference to his wife of 60 years.

Morrison then informed him to have a bit of a think about it, and let them now by the end of the day.

“We’ll let us know, and keep doing god’s work mate. Talk soon.”

Ceste-Kent told us he will make a decision by the end of the day once he figures out what franking credits are, and how they benefit him.

I’ve Had A Gutful Of Being Unfairly Targeted Says Extremely Fair And Measured Politician

An always rational, even-handed and unwavering voice of reason has today hit out at the media for unfairly targeting her and her party.

Pauline Hanson, who used her maiden speech to Parliament to dog whistle about Australia ‘being swamped by Asians,’ and last year wore a burqa into the Senate to agitate as much as she humanly could, has today explained that she has been given a rough go of late.

Bill Shorten Chucks His Keys In The Bowl In Brave Effort To Win Over Swing Voters

TEXT:

The Opposition Leader and aspiring Prime Minister Bill Bradbury Shorten has today pulled out all the stops in a bold attempt to win over the nation’s marginal voters.

Hoping to skate his way past everyone else come mid May, Shorten has this week decided to throw the keys to his Nissan Cube in the bowl.

With his wires potentially somewhat crossed, it seems as though Bradbury Shorten was attempting to win over the highly important swing voters ahead of the May 18 election, by attending a local Swingers event in Betoota’s French Quarter.

‘Keys in the bowl parties’ are often associated with  sexual ‘swinging’ events, whereby by couples exchange partners based upon people picking keys out of the bowl at random.

Shorten explained that by taking part in the event, he was hoping to win crucial votes ahead of the election.

“Everyone always goes on about how important it is to secure the swinging voter, so that’s what I’m going to go ahead and do,” he said.

“I’m not leaving this to chance, my whole life has been leading up to this election and will be entirely defined by it. So if it takes me chucking the keys in the bowl, that’s what I’ll do.”

“It might not be conventional, going ahead and doing this sort of thing, but I’ll do anything to secure votes and win.”

“I’ll even say something dirty, like ‘Stop Adani,’ or ‘privatise medicare’ if push comes to shove.”

“Actually please don’t put that in,” he asked.

We then pretended the line went dead before he finished asking the question and left Shorten to it.

Greens Leader Richard Di Natale had a prolonged moment of introspection this afternoon as he scrolled through his social media feed.

The period of self-analysis and soul-searching came just moments ago as the former VFL player and current new age man got three back to back Coachella shots from a few of his old friends.

“Fuck that looks good doesn’t it,” he sighed, showing the The Advocate a photo of a dreadlocked middle aged white man in some Peruvian looking attire standing out in the Californian desert.

“So many of my old mates are over there getting bent without a worry in the world, and I’m here trying to deal with the morons that make up this Parliament,” he said taking a sip from his tumeric and ginger lemon Kombucha.

“There are days when it’s worth it, and then there a days when the Prime Minister does a Borat impression which just make you wonder why you didn’t just throw it all in and head of to Cali for a few weeks.”

“I’m a doctor you know? Not an actual PhD fake one, I don’t have to do this like some of these other career politicians.”

Di Natale then took a big breath, had a sniff of some essential oils he had stashed away in his coat pocket and pulled himself together.

“I’m alright, just an existential moment, we all have em,” Di Natale said.

We confirmed that that was indeed the case.

“I’ll give them a call when they’re back and scat as all fuck, and then I’ll take my turn to rub it in their face and throw them into an existential crisis.”

The Nightwatchman Drops A Yassou While Meeting With Lebanese Community Members

TEXT:

The nation’s Nightwatchman Prime Minister has today greeted some members of the Australian Lebanese community with a Yassou.

It’s not yet known why the Nightwatchman threw in the Yassou, a multi-purpose term meaning “your health” in Greek and often used by Greek people as a casual greeting.

The strange cultural reference comes after the member for the Cook yesterday dropped a ‘ni hao’ when speaking with a Korean woman in Strathfield yesterday.

His comment drew criticism around the country after he did his best impersonation of a racist One Nation voter who says they think ‘all Asians look the same.’

However, the awkward gaffe seems to have failed to perturb the man who is trying to brand himself as a daggy blokey dad to win an election for some reason, who this morning was trying his best to seem like he isn’t a white bogan from the Shire.

“Ha ha anyone got an Ouzo,” the Nightwatchman laughed to the confused members who had to take time out of their day to pose for photos with the bumbling politician.

“Seriously, how good are Dolmades?”

“Ha ha this concrete could do with a hose down aye,” he finally said before his media advisor dragged him away.

Shorten Spends Morning Sharpening Up His Speed Skates

TEXT:

Opposition Leader Bill Bradbury Shorten has today spent the morning sharpening up his tools.

The aspiring Prime Minister hoping not to Michael Daley an easy catch and pass try in the corner told The Advocate that it’s been a big couple of hours making sure his speed skates are perfectly prepared for the months ahead.

“I’m making sure I get this right,” explained the Labor leader looking likely to Steven Bradbury this election and swan his way into the Prime Ministership.

“I don’t know how long I’m in this CFMEU broom cupboard for so I’m actually glad I’ve got the opportunity to sharpen up these skates to occupy my time.”

“I’ve got them really sharp so far you know.”

“Sharp enough to cut out any gaffes about Adani or Asians being smart I hope,” Shorten said admiring the shining blades.

Shorten told us that he’s been watching videos of his hero and idol Steven Bradbury speeding round the rink and storming home to win gold.

“Becoming the Prime Minister is my gold medal,” Shorten said.

“That’s why I strategically knifed sitting Prime Ministers and staged coups, so I could put my self in the position to speed on past as everyone falls down.”

“Anyway, back to it,” he said pulling down the safety goggles and putting the gloves back on.

Shorten To Remain Undecided On Adani Until He’s In Central QLD And There’s No Cameras Around

TEXT:

Opposition Leader Bill Bradbury Shorten has today confirmed that when it comes to Adani, he will remain as neutral as the nation of Switzerland, until he’s in Central Queensland and no one’s around.

This admission comes this morning after news broke that it is looking ever more likely that the government will allow a giant multinational company to desecrate Queensland’s environment in a perfect example of a political system held ransom by rampant capitalism.

However, rather than coming out and condemning the Government’s support for the Carmichael Coal Mine which the nation’s environmental scientists say is a very bad idea, the leader of the country’s Labor party has refused to comment just yet.

Shorten has confirmed that he won’t overturn the government’s decision if he Bradbury’s his way to power this year, and that he won’t be providing his stance on the mine until he is alone with some swing voters in Queensland and the cameras are not rolling.

“I’ll be giving comment on this issue that has been running for the last few years in the national spotlight when the times right and my staffers have figured out where the most amount of votes is,” he said.

“If it becomes an election issue then of course I will just say the opposite of what the Libs are saying, but until then I’m just going to whisper my quiet support to people in marginal electorates that benefit economically in the short term.”

Shorten then checked with his advisors and informed The Advocate that that is all he was allowed to say today.

Nightwatchman’s Media Team Ban FM Radio Interviews Until This Engadine Maccas Shit Dies Down

TEXT:

Scott Morrison has been spoon fed some very clear instructions from his media team today.

“Nightwatch- I mean, Scott. I can’t stress how important it is for you to not agree to anymore FM radio interviews” pleaded Josie Franks, the head of ScoMo’s media team. 

“At least not until this bloody Engadine Macca’s shit dies down”

“Shit, sorry, I didn’t mean to call it out like that.”

The Engadine incident that his top media advisor is referring to allegedly took place in the dining area of the Engadine McDonald’s after Cronulla’s loss to Brisbane in the 1997 Super League grand final. 

“And while you’re at it, best you avoid Waleed too, you’re not equipped to go toe to toe with him – especially after your recent Borat impersonation.” Added Josie while shaking her head in shame.

The Advocate believes ScoMo’s media team are brainstorming as many ways as they can to physically stop their leader from opening his mouth and embarrassing himself until closer to the election.

“Most of us just want to lock him in a trunk.”

“But realistically we’re just going to have to hold fast to banning him from FM interviews – if he says fair dinkum one more time I think a kangaroo might die.”

After a busy morning trying to do his best to prevent the Government from self-destructing as badly as possible, Pyne decided to take the afternoon off to celebrate the big news coming out of Sweeden today.

The man who famously confessed his love for the band ABBA on the orderly clapathon that is Q&A, told The Advocate today that he was ecstatic about the news that the big name pop group are releasing two more songs this year.

“I’ve whacked on the biggest hits, poured my self a nice glass of Barossa Shiraz and am setting about getting my outfit ready for what will be the biggest night of the year,” said Pyne about the band that’s sent plenty of hearts over the age of 50 a flutter.

“I hope it’s more Fernando than Money Money Money,  if you know what I mean.”

Exhilarating Growth Of Parliament House Lawn Distracts Journalists From Shorten Press Conference

TEXT:

Opposition Leader Bill Shorten has had to use his ‘grumpy voice’ at a press conference in Canberra today.

After receiving no attention for running in and out of Parliament House 3 times in his exercise gear this morning, the man who lists Steven Bradbury as his idol decided to create some headlines the old fashioned way.

Giving a run of the mill press conference on the steps of the nation’s law-making building, the Big Bang fan Shorten began to notice the political reporters and camera people getting a little distracted.

Trying to inform them on something he was planning to say in the Budget Reply tonight, Shorten had to get a little bit snappy, and unleash his ‘angry Sheldon voice,’ after the group of media people began inspecting the grassy lawn in front of him.

“It’s not Buffalo Grass you uneducated numpty’s,” said a furious Shorten, interrupting the political team from the ABC who were analysing the incredible rate of growth of the grass out the front of ‘the house.’

“Now I’ve got something to say up here that’s more interesting and entertaining than watching grass grow, so pay attention before I drop a ‘Bazninga‘ on you.”

The reporters reportedly tried to focus their attention on the conference before inevitably drifting off again and asking Shorten’s Media Advisor if they could just send whatever he wanted to say in a press release.

Bloke Wearing Sleeveless Puffer Jacket Really Impressed By Federal Budget And ScoMo In General

TEXT:

A local early-twenties graduate stockbroker has today called it early that Scott Morrison will win the 2019 Federal Election.

While speaking to his uninterested mates about last night’s Federal Budget, the high-pitched neoliberal believes last night’s budget was very impressive, and so is Scott Morrison, considering what he’s been handed, and don’t downplay him just yet.

“Just you watch mate. He’ll win this thing”

“I’m really impressed by him and the other bloke [Josh Frydenberg MP]”

It is not yet known to the other punters at the Lord Kidman hotel why Hunter Bligh (22) feels the need to ruin a perfectly good piss up with weird political conversations, but the fact he is wearing a sleeveless puffy jacket with a checkered shirt says enough.

The former 3rd XV half-back for one of the most prestigious private schools in Western Queensland has paired his ‘concrete cowboy’ look with a pair of khaki chinos and dark brown dress boots – the type of outfit usually reserved for young Australian men who are confident they will never have to join the military and fight unnecessary wars in the Middle East.

who was barely even a teenager when John Howard was voted out of power, has today regurgitated his conservative father’s drunken golf rant that suggests the former Prime Minister was the greatest Australian leader in modern history.

“Mate” he says.

“Easily”

“You should read his autobiography. It’ll really change your view of him”

While appearing to talk from ‘life experience’ when discussing trade laws and tax breaks, Hunter is yet to reveal that he still lives at home and refuses to pay rent to his valium-addled parents because he needs to save for a new start-up idea.

Abbott Shows Solidarity With Morrison By Demanding Better Public Toilets At Engadine Maccas

TEXT:

In a rare show of solidarity within Coalition ranks, the Member for Warringah has today thrown his support behind his Prime Minister.

Fearing for his seat, and his relevance, Tony Abbott told The Advocate this morning that he fully supports Scott Morrison’s demands for better public toilets, at places like Manly Beach and Engadine Maccas.

“Enough is enough, we need better facilities in places that important people like myself and Sco-mo like to visit,” an irate Abbott said.

The calls come after the personal friend of convicted pedophile George Pell blew up on social media early this year initially demanding for better toilets on Manly beach, like it was something that had been out of his control for the last 25 years he had been the local member.

“Now, ah, I’m not, ah, going to go, ah, into the details of the whole post-1997 Super League incident at the Engadine McDonalds,” Abbott began from the beach this morning.

“But the current state of toilet facilities on Manly Beach and Engadine is nearly as appalling as what the minimum wage casually employed highschooler’s had to deal with on that ill-fated night in the Shire.”

“But I made a promise not to snipe and undermine the government ages ago, which I broke, and then promised again, and I’ll stay true to that word until it’s confirmed that I’m getting booted by Zali, so I’m not going into any more detail about the Engadine Incident okay,” Abbott said bringing the incident up again for the 3rd time.

Abbott Offers Nightwatchman Budget Tips: “The Punters Love Ballet And Christian Counsellors”

TEXT:

Scott Morrison has today politely ignored former Prime Minister Tony Abbott’s tips on how to keep the masses happy in the 2019 Federal Budget.

This comes as The Nightwatchman says the coalition, but mostly the Liberal Party, has been working towards the surplus it will deliver in Tuesday’s budget since it was elected in 2013.

However, the soon to be unemployed Member For Warringah, Tony Abbott, says he worries Morrison might be pandering a bit too much to the working underclasses and atheists.

“Scott. I know times have changed and we have to look like we believe in climate change” he said.

“But I’m hoping you had a little read through of the budget I pulled together in my 20 months as Prime Minister”

The 2014 Australian federal budget was the federal budget to fund government services and operations for the 2014/15 financial year. The 2014 budget was the first delivered by the Abbott Government, since the Coalition’s victory in the 2013 Australian federal election and put a big focus on making the poor pay for medical appointments, while also allowing concessions for ballet, and attempting to cut costs on mental health by replacing trained public school counsellors with Christian clergymen.

Abbott, who’s is starting to fear his time in the top job has become so irrelevant that he might not even get a state funeral, says if there’s one legacy he’s willing to stand behind, it’s that he made ballet cheaper for rich people in the North Shore.

“Remember. The punters might like the idea of a free medical appointment, but don’t rob them of the chance for their daughters and lavender-scented sons to learn the elegance of performance dance”

“Also, don’t underestimate how effective these Christian counsellors are at infiltrating public schools with their spiritual guidance”

However, while confident that his pentecostal Turnbull Lite will make the right decision regarding rich people hobbies and Christian counselling, he also had one big criticism.

“What’s all this shit about raising the Newstart?”

“We are creating a welfare state of flakey Australian citizens living off extortionate lifelong pensions for doing fuck all in their lives!”

Nationals MP Visits Struggling Farmer To Deliver Good News That Gina Wants To Buy His Property

TEXT:

After decades on erratic weather bouncing between crippling drought and devastating flood, embattled farmer Don Kipfler (65) was interested to see what his local MP was going to bring to the table in the first ever visit the property since he was elected in 1984.

Don says he’s not exaggerating when he says how fucked things are, and you can check his sheds if you don’t believe him.

“I’m not one of those whingeing bluebloods on the plains” says the struggling father of four.

“All of my kids were pulled out of boarding school in the 2000s and we got them special licenses to drive into town”

“There’s no luxury off-road vehicles out here. I’m running around on a clapped out 1988 Patrol”

Don says that as a third generation farming family, it’s too late for him and his wife to up-skill and find work in town. Opting to instead work this harsh land until they die, or until a Shorten government announces knee-jerk ban on eating livestock and they end up locking the gate to live as paupers in emergency public housing in Bourke.

“When it rains, I tighten the belt and implement long-term business strategies to survive off what we make” he says.

“When it floods. We try and catch as much of that brown gold in dams that I’ve had to illegally excavate on paddocks I’ve had to illegally clear”

“It’ll be interesting to see what the local National MP says. I know he’s fucken terrified of losing his seat to the Shooters and Fishers”

However, little does Don know, his local MP is out here to deliver some good news. A retirement plan if you will.

“I got a phone call from Gina” says the local politician, who spent the first two decades of his career working as an accountant in Noosa.

“Got some real good news for ya”

Don and his wife Kay tell the politician that they are all ears, before several National Party staffers begin to pat them down to make sure the ageing agriculturalists aren’t wearing any hidden microphones planted on them by The Greens or any number of anti-corruption agencies.

The National MP, satisfied that he won’t go to prison for this exchange, begins to whisper.

“Don’t get mad. It’s good news” he says.

“But if you’ve ever wondered who’s been leaving your gates open, I’ve told Gina’s people it’s ok for them to discreetly come in here over night and do some seismic testing”

An infuriated Don immediately lunges for the MP who’s basically just admitted to being the reason he lost 200 head of cattle over the last 6 months.

He is eventually restrained by the National staffers and told to calm down, because there’s some good news coming.

“Anyway, she reckons you might be on top of some coal. And as a beneficiary of her handsome donations, Barnaby has sent me out here to tell you that she’s keen to buy the place and open cut this rock farm to the size of Sydney Harbour. You’ll get 120% of market value, though. And you can lease it back for pennies until we need the country”

Don, still speechless with rage, lets Kay do the talking.

“We’ll think about it” she says.

“We were kind of hoping for a bit of assistance with the thousands of fence posts we just lost in the flood, though”

“Just think about it” says the politician

“Port Douglas is calling”

Election Presumed To Be Close As Liberals Begin Promising Things For Poor People

TEXT:

The nation has received it’s strongest indication yet that a federal election is looming.

The indication comes after Senior Liberal Senator Arthur Sinodinos took to Q & A last night to radically call for a raise to the Newstart payment.

On the eve of the budget, with an election now due to be called any time over the next fortnight, the Liberal senator made the hollow and vague call to raise unemployment benefits in an effort to be seen to be giving poor people things.

With the Nightwatchman’s government on the rocks after years of political infighting and turmoil, and the threat of an invasion of brown people on boats seemingly not working, it’s believed that some members are concerned they may lose their seats think they should be promising people doing it tough some things.

“Obviously we aren’t going to start promising money for public housing, or crack down on corporate tax evasion or force huge multinationals pillaging our natural resources to pay their fair share of royalties, but a little top up to people living on less that 40 bucks a day should hopefully bring a few people around,” Sinodinos told our reporters this morning.

“I mean obviously it won’t happen if we get re-elected but hopefully enough people see it and thing that maybe we are doing something about inequality in this country.”

Greens Volunteer Says He Knows It’s Like Bad To Say This But Immigrants Only Vote Conservatively Because They Aren’t That Well Educated

TEXT:

Richie Mund (27) a well-known vocal campaigner and son of two career public servants in high-paid and secure bureaucratic positions within either the ABC or the state library, says theres a been a lot of government policy that can be blamed for the current trend of anti-intellectualism in Australian politics.

Number one, he says John Howard gutted education to keep the masses stupid, and two, the left have been overtaken by fruitless intersectionality focusing on women’s rights and the experiences of immigrants and Aboriginal people.

“Like, don’t get me wrong. I’m a big supporter of no flags, no borders, et cetera et cetera… But right now. In this country…. The rates of land clearing is catastrophic”

“It’s got to get to the point where we are going to need skim over the issues of these so called minorities and focus on the immediate threats to our environment”

“Like, we can get back to all that stuff, but I’m sick of having to play identity politics while the reliability of wind power continues to be ignored”

Richie, who volunteers for the Greens outside of his casually contracted job creating memes for GetUp says that he could never tell his colleagues what he really thinks about the result of the 2017 gay marriage plebiscite and the subsequent re-election of the Liberal Party in New South Wales.

“I know it’s like bad to say this but the reason immigrants and poor people, and like bogan farmers, vote conservatively… it’s because they aren’t really that well educated unfortunately”

Richie believes that when we can raise education standards in this country to the point where every man and woman have a similar quality of schooling as he and his mates did at Melbourne’s Xavier college, then no one will ever vote Liberal again.

But for now, he’s gotta wade through the murky waters of equality and affirmative action in order to save the world.

“Don’t get me started on the ALLEGED examples of sexism I’ve been accused of in my office. Talk about a speed bump in my career”

Richie says that while the #MeToo movement is very important for holding AFL stars and b-list actors accountable for their treatment of women, he never thought it would get to the point where he was unable to talk over people at dinner parties.

“Elon never got to where he was by having to worry about unfair power balances in the workplace” says Richie.

One Nation leader Pauline Hanson has today fronted the media, with a bold new claim that she wasn’t of a sound mind when she made comments about vaccinations causing Autism.

Today’s comments relate to that time Hanson did her best NRL Insta Wag impression and urged people to do their own research into vaccinations.

“I apologise for that time that I said Australian’s vaccination health program the Government’s ‘no jab, no pay’ policy was a “dictatorship”” she said this morning.

Her comments come after Senior One Nation figures sought to blame an attempted 20 million dollar deal with the NRA on being out ‘on the sauce.’

“Whilst I’m still not a hundred percent sold on the whole vaccinations thing, I am seeking for you, the public, to forgive me for my comments as I was out on the sauce all night.”

“A few chandys down at the Jets Leagues Club followed by some house bubbly’s and a couple of tall white wines with ice cubes in them had me pretty rattled to be honest, and I completely forgot that I was supposed to be on that communist propaganda show Insiders.” 

“9 am on a Sunday, what an appalling time to have a TV show. Barry worked for Bob Hawke, surely he knows better than having the show at that time.”

Following NSW Labor’s catastrophic bed-shit over the weekend, the Federal Opposition have decided that it might be worth doing and saying some stuff before the upcoming election.

High-ranking Labor powerbrokers have declared that while the incumbent Prime Bradbury Bill Shorten appears to be scandal-free for now, his lack of policy regarding fish kills, climate change, asylum seekers, decentralisation, infrastructure, and anything else that would warrant an emotive response from the Australian public – probably means he doesn’t have the momentum to carry him through even the slightest of gaffes.

These new late-night training sessions will include a special focus on not vilifying Asians to win cheap political points in the Blue Mountains, and talking about things other than stadiums

“We are going to be going pretty hard on him over the next few weeks,” explained a high ranking union official.

“Locking him in a room, and forcing him to answer questions and give his opinion on things without informing him what the Government’s position is on the issue.”

“I’ll be honest with you, the first few sessions were tough. He begged us to give him hints, little snippets of info and prompts. But he seems to be making some improvements.”

“The signs are promising.”

“The next stage is going to be sending him down to pubs and making him interact with local punters to hone up on his interpersonal skills.”

The insider explained that only then will the party be confident Shorten can withstand a minor gaffe or slip up.

NSW Labor Wondering Which Bumbling Generic-Looking Career Politician Should Lead The Party Next

The NSW Labor Party has confirmed this afternoon that they are still mulling over which bumbling politician they should appoint to lead the party next.

This comes after Michael Daley managed to chop the ball onto his own stumps a week out from the election, following his appointment to lead the party in the wake of the Luke Foley sexual harassment scandal.

“Yeah we aren’t sure which generic-looking white career politician we should tap on the shoulder to lead the party in NSW next,” said an anonymous Labor insider over the phone today.

“Ever since Bob (Carr) walked out of Macquarie Street and into Macquarie Bank we’ve fallen apart at the seams really.”

“Obviously there’s the whole ICAC period were our party was sprung pulling all sorts of shit on the people of NSW, and then we had Luke Foley acting like a fucking creep.”

“And then there was a Michael.”

“Whose supporters are blaming the fact that he didn’t get enough favourable coverage in the media, and not the fact he said something racist about immigrants despite living in a city were nearly half the population is either a first or second generation immigrant, and completely shat the bed in the week leading up to the election.”

“I mean the Murdoch media is as crook as my old man’s knees, but we need someone who seems at least semi-competent.”

The Opposition Leader of NSW Michael Daley has today chalked up another loss.

Following his previously unthinkable loss to the Developers and Boomers Party of Australia, colloquially known as the Liberal Party last night, Michael Daley somehow managed to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory in a game of checkers this morning.

After conceding defeat to Gladys Berejiklian following his effort to Hillary Clinton the open layup, Daley has reportedly been milling around the house looking for something to take his mind off the loss.

Instead of getting out and doing the Coogee to Bondi like all of the other narcissistic people who live in the Eastern Suburbs do on their weekend, Daley decided to pass the time with a game of checkers.

However, his wife told our reporters that Daley was heard losing it a short time later after he somehow managed to lose to himself.

“I don’t even know why he plays checkers really, it’s a child’s game, but he takes it quite seriously,” she said over the phone.

“He used to play on the computer against other people, but quite often they had Asian sounding names and losing would set him right off.”

Local Dubbo grazier Horrace Calare (62) says he’s still a bit confused as to why the NSW Labor Party has spent the last month campaigning as a single-issue party.

“Jeez. Thought they would have jumped on the fish kill. I could almost smell it from here” says Horrace.

“Or the fact that you can’t find a beer outside the casino during the Easter Show”

“I spent the last couple month thinking their leader was named Luke something, but turns out he’d been discreetly replaced by white dork #2, who’s name I didn’t learn until his 6th press conference outside Allianz stadium this week”

Calare’s state electorate of Dubbo voted yesterday in favour of the National Party, only by 1.5% over a local independent, with the number three going to the Shooters and Fishers.

Horrace says you’d be surprised at how little you heard any of them talking about stadiums.

Millennial Handing Out Vote Labor Cards Lucky He Didn’t Have Job Taken By Much Smarter Asian

A local man who doesn’t have a PhD is counting his blessings today as he stands outside a primary school handing out Labor vote cards.

Kyle Vanguard (21) is studying a measly arts degree, the outcome of which will likely mean he won’t make enough money to live in Sydney and will have to leave.

The Advocate stood with Kyle as he jovially handed out pamphlets to disgruntled voters to see just why he had such a spring in his step while doing possibly the shittest job in the campaign.

“I’m just grateful to have a job in Sydney!”

“There are much smarter Asians out there, they all have PhDs, I can’t compete with that”

“I realise this is a volunteer job, so it wouldn’t be that attractive to someone with a PhD, but I am still very lucky to have this job”

“Mr. Daley said none of my generation would get a job in Sydney at all, because of the Asians, so yeah, I’m pretty happy with this.”

Kyle is referring to comments made by the NSW Labor leader back in September 2018 while at a politics-in-the-pub session in Wentworth Falls.

He’s on record saying “Our children will flee and who are they being replaced with?… Young people from typically Asia with PhDs.”

While Mr. Daley has apologised repeatedly for his controversial comments, at least one positive that has come out is that millennials like Kyle are grateful for the jobs that they can still get.

Uncle Tony X Caught Filling Manly Street Library With Hardcore Black Nationalist Literature

TEXT:

Respected Northern Beaches Elder Tony Abbott has today decided it is time to educate the allies, after stumbling across what he describes as a ‘wonderful thing’ while door-knocking in Dee Why, deep within his electorate’s Tongan Quarter.

The former Prime Minister appeared incredibly infatuated by the stock standard suburban initiative, known as a ‘street library’ – where residents can share books freely.

“It’s amazing the things you see and learn while door-knocking,” Mr Abbott said.

“I’ve never seen anything like this before, the Tango Avenue street library. And I want to say what a wonderful thing for the residents to be doing.”

Thrilled by the concept of a free communal book exchange for passersby, the former PM has since taken it upon himself to sneak a bit of his own reccomendations in there.

Namely, the Black Panther Party Manifesto, the Autobiography of Huey P Newton and of course the story of Malcolm X.

“It’s time to turn the allies into accomplices” he said, while sliding in another weather beaten book of teachings that ‘you don’t get to read in school’.

After a lifetime of disempowerment and oppression at the hands of his more moderate Liberal Party colleagues, Former Prime Minister Tony Abbott has today vowed to protect his brothers and sisters by any means necessary.

This comes after the newly-appointed Special Envoy to Indigenous Affairs found himself entwined in the writing of iconic black American nationalist, Malcolm X.

It is believed after dabbling with the work of James Baldwin, as well as an array of African-American writers closely aligned with the Harlem Renaissance, Uncle Tony got his hands on the Autobiography Of Malcolm X, and has in turn radically changed his approach to politics.

Liberal Party insiders say that the Member For Warringah has begun drawing direct correlations between the plight of black and Native Americans, and his own mob.

“A man who stands for nothing will fall for anything.” said the newly appointed Special Envoy to Indigenous Affairs.

“We didn’t land on Botany Bay, Botany Bay landed on us!”

NSW Labor Leader and the man most likely to drop a mistimed cover drive Michael Daley has spent the final day before the election utilising his time wisely.

After a big few weeks on the campaign trail, Daley decided to pull out the big guns today and rile up voters in a desperate attempt to get the top job in state politics. 

Instead of doing pressers and shaking hands with people in as many different communities as possible, Daley has instead spent the morning trying to catch people of Asian appearance people buying baby formula.

Since his mildly-racist rant about highly educated Asian people taking the jobs of lazy rich white kids made headlines, Daley has decided to take it one step further, by harassing Chinese shoppers buying baby formula.

Sneaking through the aisles of his local Coles in Maroubra, which he a couple of days ago said he didn’t want to become ‘Chatswood by the sea,’ Daley said he caught a few unsuspecting shoppers on phone.

“Yeah, someone get Tracey on the phone, I’ve got some good shit here,” he told our reporter motioning to his phone.

“Maybe I might even get a favourable run in the Tele too. I know this stuff really riles up those Western Sydney mouthbreathers; I’ve gotta get it out before everyone votes tomorrow.”

Daley then told our reporters that he’s off to a press conference today where he plans to stand there for 20 minutes with a small silver whistle that emits high-frequency noise barely audible to the human ear.

“Then I’m gonna wake up tomorrow and eat 15 fucking sausage sandwiches for breakfast like a man.”

“Pay attention Sco-mo if you wanna see what a real Aussie bloke looks like.”

More to come.

Daily Telegraph Readers Starting To Think Their Newspaper Might Have A Slight Political Bias

TEXT:

Readers of the esteemed Murdoch tabloid that is the Daily Telegraph have been left wondering this week whether the newspaper may potentially be leaning slightly towards the NSW Liberal Party.

This comes after a month of opinion pieces disguised as news stories have graced the front pages of the paper in an indication that there might be some sort of desire to get Gladys Berejiklian elected as Premier.

82-year-old grandfather of 15 Gerry Atrick explained to our reporters from the lifeless harbour capital that he is starting to think that the Tele might be pushing an agenda.

“Yeah, I popped on the tablet today, which never seems to work properly,  to scroll through the breaking news and I noticed the online site was covered in Vote Liberal ads again,” Atrick said.

“It does seem a bit fishy that all the negative Labor stories are set to the backdrop of NSW Liberal Team.”

“But I guess it’s just election advertising, I’m sure they’ll run Labor ads tomorrow.”

“And that story they ran about the cat picking the winner of the election through bowls of food was a perfect example of even-handed reporting.”

“It’s good that they’ve tried to make a bit of an effort to balance the out the effect of the state-funded left-wing media organisation that is the ABC. It really annoys me how the public broadcaster asks people on the right as well as the left questions that they don’t want to answer.”

Nation Quietly Nervous About What Morrison Thinks Constitutes As Vilifying Muslims

TEXT:

The nation has confirmed this morning that it’s a bit worried about what the Nightwatchman Prime Minister actually thinks is vilifying Muslims.

This admission comes after Scott Morrison claimed this week that he was disgusted by claims that he has vilified Muslims in the past, and refuted any attempt to maybe insinuate that he’s used the community to gain political traction.

The man who keeps a shiny “I stopped these” boat trophy on his desk and orchestrated Operation Sovereign Borders is reportedly disgusted by claims that he has ever done anything that could constitute giving people of the Islamic faith a hard time.

“These allegations are unfounded and amount to nothing more than a smear campaign,” explained the Prime Minister who sought to gain as many political points as he could out of broadly blaming the Islamic Community for the Melbourne CBD terror attack last November.

“It’s disgraceful what the non-Murdoch media is trying to insinuate,” explained the PM.

A spokesperson for the nation down at the famous Lord Kidman Hotel in Betoota’s Old City District said that everyone is a bit nervous about what the PM thinks vilifying actually means.

“I mean he’s squeezed every single political drop out of locking people up In offshore prisons and jumped at any opportunity to use ‘terror’ to gain political traction, so we are just a bit concerned about what he might do if he decides to actually ‘vilify’ the Islamic community,” the spokesperson said.

“We just hope he doesn’t get to the point where he is so desperate that he decides to carry out what he sees as policies which actually vilify Muslims.”

Asian With PHD Gleefully Sniggers After Taking Michael Daley’s Daughter’s Job As RSL Glassie

TEXT:

A ‘highly educated Asian’ who has had no problem finding unskilled work in Sydney since he arrived in Australia to study aeronautical engineering three years ago, says he couldn’t say no to the opportunity of taking a part time job that could have gone to a stay-at-home daughter of a State Politician.

“This is great for me” he said.

“While all of these entitled white kids are down in Melbourne dancing until the early hours and having fun, I’m studying and enjoying the fruits of my 12-hour shifts as a glassie at the Rooty RSL”

“Mwahahaha”

But according to NSW Leader Of The Opposition, Michael Daley, it’s not that funny.

He says young people are leaving Sydney, and it’s because of the cost of living in the boomerstani capital, meaning the jobs they would have are going to ‘young people with PHDs, typically from Asia’.

It is not yet clear how exactly Mr Daley was attempting to blame the foreigners who are moving into these vacant employment opportunities for the jobs being left vacant to begin with.

One thing is that is for sure, he appears to be struggling with the transition into an empty nester, after revealing that he’d like his 27-year-old daughter to be living at home with him at the pubs that close at 8:30pm, and not in St Kilda with the 24-hour-public transport and a youth culture that isn’t beholden to noise complaints from old wealth-hoarding cunts who decided to retire in a densely metropolitan area.

He says it’s because of the Asians.

“It’s not a bad thing because Asian kids are coming to work here, it’s a bad thing because I’d like my daughter to be living in Maroubra rather than St Kilda,” he said on conservative talkback radio station 2GB yesterday, where he somehow even managed to offend Ray Hadley’s listeners.

“Asians are to blame for all of this”

“Except the Asians that are thinking about buying my cosy three-bedder investment property in Maroubra”

Hunky Student Climate Activist Comes Home From Strike Looking Sleepy And Smelling Of Impulse

TEXT:

A young man passionate about climate change has just arrived home from a big day of activism today.

Blayne Wilson from Betoota Heights Secondary College has returned from the climate strikes to his family home looking pretty tired and smelling of teenage deodorant.

“Yeah it was good mum,” said the nonchalant high schooler currently making waves in his friendship group due to his recent relationships.

“I don’t know what else to tell you, it was great to get out and have our voice heard or whatever,” said the young man plowing through a bowl of cereal.

Unappeased, Wilson’s naive mum, who keeps her left wing views reasonably close to herself, kept prodding the young man on the day.

“Where there any notable people from town down there? What sort of chants deed people chant?” she asked.

“Where there any funny signs?” she asked Blayne who had pretty much switched off.

“Yeah there were some,” I guess replied the high schooler checking his Instagram.

Clocking out from the conversation, the young heart throb grabbed his bag that had previously stashed a 6 pack of cheap imported beers, asked his mum where dinner was and disappeared into his room.

Dutton Drops New Pre-Election Backflip: “Some Of My Best Mates Are South Sudanese Teenagers”

TEXT:

Home Affairs Minister, Peter Dutton, says the Morrison government should not be in the business of drumming up scare campaigns about African teenage gangs in Melbourne, following new poll numbers that suggest he’s probably going to get shafted from this seat he barely held onto last election.

“I just, I just think it’s all a bit of a beat up” says Dutton, in a clear backflip that goes against literally everything else he’s been saying for the last five years.

“I think, like many other young migrant waves, the South Sudanese have their own problems and they are no different to those that came before them. We should be focused on making them feel like they are part of our community, not vilifying them”

“Leave them alone. They are just kids”

“Some of my best mates are South Sudanese teenagers”

This comes a day after Dutton’s last back flip regarding the building of new coal-fired power stations, stating he believes taxpayers should not have to  support upgrades to existing plants.

Dutton on Thursday faced a testy Ray Hadley for a weekly radio interview, where the outspoken coal advocate accused Dutton of being “too scared” to say Australia needed more power stations.

“Coal is yucky” said Dutton.

“It’s so bad for the environment! I implore the school students from the Dickson electorate to join me in the climate strike tomorrow!”

“Also, Manus and Nauru are bad, and I hate negative gearing!”

Albo Ditches His Bumbag After Receiving Tip Off About Jacks Waiting At The Next Station

Former Deputy Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has today moved quickly to avoid any confrontation with local police today, after a close call during his commute home from the Burwood cinemas.

The Member For Grayndler acted swiftly to avoid controversy after one of the eshays in his group chat sent through a warning about jacks at Lewisham station in Sydney’s inner-west.

Just months of an election, it isn’t lost on Albo that spending an afternoon in the lock up might not help his chances with the growing voter bloc of Range-Rover mums in his electorate.

“Fuck that noise” he said.

“I gotta get rid of this itsh”

With only one station to go until an inevitable pat-down, the Shadow Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Cities and Regional Development managed to flick his FILA bumbag onto the tracks just before the doors closed.

“It’s etswah” he said.

“I’ve got my phone in my dacks”

Without identifying what might’ve been in his bummie, Albo says it’s not worth getting pinched with anything, especially given his likelihood of being Prime Minister a couple months after the next election.

City With 10pm Curfew Definitely Needs 3 New Stadiums, Says D̶e̶v̶e̶l̶o̶p̶e̶r̶s̶ NSW Premier

TEXT:

In a blind effort to strike an emotive cord with apathetic Sydney voters, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian is going ahead with her plan to spend more than two billion dollars to demolish and rebuild both ANZ and Allianz stadiums.

With the finishing touches being applied to the new Parramatta Stadium, and something like $25 million being designated for another stadium in the bush, NSW voters say they appreciate all the effort going in to entertaining cityfolk, but it’s still pretty weird that you can’t get a beer after like 9:30 in most of Sydney.

“Don’t get me wrong, I love stadiums” said one drought-stricken Dubbo voter, Sparky Sherridun (55)

“I literally had a wet dream about stadiums last night”

“But last time I went to Sydney to watch the Waratahs lose, there wasn’t even 1000 cunts at the grounds, and they were only serving mid-strength”

“We wandered up to Surry Hills and Paddington afterwards and couldn’t find one pub that was open.”

“What are they planning on showing in these Stadiums? Hillsong concerts?”

However, D̶e̶v̶e̶l̶o̶p̶e̶r̶s̶ NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian says this kind of sentiment is unhelpful and does nothing for Sydney’s reputation as the third most liveable city in New South Wales.

“As someone who never drank more than three glasses of rosè in one sitting before the age of forty, I learnt very early on that there are plenty of ways to keep occupied on a night out in Sydney” wrote the Premier, in the foreword of a new pamphlet that has been mailed out to Sydney voters.

“New stadiums bring jobs to the people that have been laid off from the Light Rail job, while we look for new overseas contractors to pick up the pieces”

“And you don’t need to be drunk to watch a game of football, in fact being sober is ideal, we still don’t know how to stop these people from letting of flares at the Wanderers matches, and we just assume alcohol is a big factor”.

The pamphlet also showed an artist’s impressions of what all these new stadiums will look like, and finished with accidentally inclusion of a byline written by the PR team representing the contractors that have been promised these refurbishments.

“Our state needs these stadiums to truly show off our liveability”

Terrified Cabbie Clocked at 180KM After Seeing Mark Latham In The Taxi Rank

TEXT:

A local taxi driver has risked a considerable fine and potential jail time today, after flying down a busy CBD thoroughfare.

The cabbie of 34 years named Graeme Wilson reached speeds of 180 k’s an hour this afternoon after spotting the former Opposition Leader Mark Latham in the taxi rank.

“Nah fuck that,” said a flustered Wilson who pulled up a few blocks away and spoke to us over the phone.

“Everyone in this industry knows you don’t pick him up,” he said, making reference to the famous incident where a drunken Latham broke a taxi driver’s arm over an insignificant fare he was probably charging the tax-payer for anyway.

“I mean, I’d been waiting for nearly an hour for a fare in the queue, and they are usually humdingers from there, needing to go to the airport and what not,”

“But as soon as I saw the aspiring One Nation Senator walk out of the building and towards my car with a shit-eating grin all over his face, I knew it wasn’t worth it.”

Wilson explained that he thought for a second about getting out of the car to run, before realising how dangerous that could be.

“That’s when he strikes, and I’m not keen on a 115 kilo sack of shit crash tackling me from behind like a bouncer who’s spotted a drunken patron throwing a glass in a crowded nightclub.”

“Anyway, I sped off, and maybe it was dangerous, but my instincts just took over. The cops and the taxi company should be fine. The first thing we get taught is to avoid Mark Latham like the functioning of our upper limbs depends on it.”

Turnbull Attempts To Move Car After It Has Been Towed

TEXT:

Popping back into the limelight to check if people still hate him, former PM Malcolm Turnbull has taken the first terrifying step in a trend known as ‘former-PMs-who-won’t-fuck-off’ by appearing in a BBC interview to talk about the time he tried to move his car long after it had been towed.

During the interview, Turnbull recounted an incident where he and his wife Lucy Turnbull parked their Rolls Royce hybrid in a no parking zone while visiting a hatted restaurant only rich people are allowed to know about.

“It was just meant to be a quick one, three courses maximum,” stated Turnbull.

“It was during one of the spills, my wife Lucy and I were stressed.”

Although aware that the situation was dire, Turnbull chose to do nothing about his parked car until he was asked to leave the restaurant and found it had already been towed.

Staring at the empty spot where his car once was, Turnbull maintained that he had always been a big supporter of moving his car and that he hoped to do so now, even as it was on its way to a tow yard.

“Moving my car is the future of Australia, nothing has changed in that regard.”

Luckily for Mr and Mrs Turnbull, they were able to find a late night Mercedes Benz dealer who sold them a car for the drive home.

“And I named that car ‘The Party Line’ so if that gets towed I can shout ‘They’re towing The Party Line!’ and everyone will laugh.”

“We Need To Switch To Renewables Now” Malcolm Turnbull Tells Volleyball With Face On It

TEXT:

Former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has proved to the Australian public he can continue to disappoint them without being in power by speaking up on issues facing the nation for the first time since about 2015.

During an intimate interview, the Baron of Backflips shared his thoughts on issues he is passionate about with all those willing to listen which was revealed to be a single volleyball with a face drawn on it.

“Renewables are the future,” stated Turnbull as he stared at the volleyball, picking at his teeth with a piece of bamboo.

“I just wish there was more I could do, don’t you?”

Upon being asked several hard-hitting questions Turnbull deflected them back to the volleyball who he began referring to affectionately as ‘Penfolds.’

“Well Penfolds, it’s not a question on whether or not I would lose the next election but whether or not I would win, don’t you agree?”

Unconfirmed reports state in between deflections Turnbull spent time staring at the boorish face of his crude confidant, nodding occasionally and once cracking into a smug sneer before speaking in what was assumed to be an interjection.

“Let me stop you right there Penfolds, I am still a Liberal first and foremost.”

“I have always been concerned about climate change. It’s just now that there’s fuck all I can do about it that I’d like to see some real change please. Wouldn’t you like that too Penfolds? God I like you Penfolds.”

Liberal Party Praises Fossil Fuel Industry For Tasteful New Paint Job On Solomon Islands

TEXT:

High-ranking cabinet ministers from within the Australian Liberal Party have today praised the fossil fuel industry and their many lobbyist donors for the cute little reno they provided for the Pacific nation of the Solomon Islands, after grounded cargo ship resulted in an irreversible oil spill in a World Heritage-listed marine sanctuary.

At least 75 tonnes of heavy fuel oil has spilled from a bulk carrier since Cyclone Oma drove it onto a reef at Rennell Island on February four.

“Looks great in my opinion” says Senator and former Italian citizen, Matt Canavan.

“The Solomon Islands needed a bit of a rebrand after all those political coups our party was directly involved in. This new paint job looks great”

The ship was carrying 700 tonnes of oil when it ran aground and there are fears the remaining fuel will spoil Rennell Island, the world’s largest raised coral atoll and home to many species found nowhere else.

“Australia remains extremely impressed by the ongoing major oil spill,” said Foreign Minister Marise Payne in a release on Sunday.

“Up to 75 tonnes of heavy fuel oil from the ship has dispersed across the Island’s sea and shoreline, coating the ecologically delicate area in a sexy matte black”

“I’m fucken all for it”

“More power to the oil companies I say. This is just one example of the amazing work they do in the vulnerable communities they steal resources from right around the world”

Nightwatchman Asks Michaelia Cash If She Could Organise A Cake For International Women’s Day

There was a certain dread in the air at Parliament House today after the majority of its constituents had to relinquish their dominance for the next few hours.

Not wanting to create another media shit-storm, The Nightwatchman got on the front foot and made a thoughtful gesture to one of the only women left on his side of parliament.

“Michaelia, Happy International Women’s Day,” said The Nightwatchman.

“I thought it would be a good idea to do something for all of the women here, you know, to show our support”

At this point Michaelia allowed her mind to wonder and imagine a parliament where there was equality.

This mirage was quickly turned to dust as Sco-Mo revealed what his thoughtful gesture was.

“Do you think you could quickly whip up a cake for everyone?”

Sco-Mo was met with a completely dumbfounded Cash, taking note of her reaction he quickly tried to make amends.

“Oh, sorry, of course you don’t have time to bake one, you can go and get one from a bakery – I won’t tell anyone!”

John Howard Commits To Giving Up Defending Convicted Pedophiles For Lent

Former Prime Minister John Howard has today confirmed that he is making a tough sacrifice this year for Lent.

Lent, which kicks of tomorrow is a solemn religious observance in the Christian calendar that begins on Ash Wednesday and ends approximately six weeks later, before Easter Sunday.

In Lent, many Christians commit to fasting, as well as giving up certain luxuries in order to replicate the sacrifice of Jesus Christ’s journey into the desert for 40 days

This year, the 2nd longest serving Prime Minister of Australia told The Advocatee that he will be committed to giving up his past time of defending convicted pedophiles for Lent.

Howard, who gave a character reference to Cardinal George Pell after the guilty verdict was handed down last week, told us it’s going to be tough, but he’s looking forward to it.

“Look, this time of the year is always a solemn one, and one in which I like to reflect and give up one of life’s luxury’s,” said Howard.

“And as a retired upper class white man living on Sydney’s North Shore, one of the many luxuries I have is to be able to openly show my support for someone who has been convicted of appalling crimes against children.”

“As you would be aware, not many people have the luxury of being able to do that, given their jobs and so on, so I’ve decided to give that up for the next few weeks.”

“I Don’t Know If A Mardi Gras Visit Would Be A Good Idea” Media Advisor Tells Morrison

Media advisor to Prime Minister Scott Morrison has made a harsh call today and has informed the nation’s leader that a visit to the Sydney Mardis Gras is probably off the cards.

Towing the line that he is for all Australians, the PM’s media team concedes a Mardis Gras appearance from Morrison would at this point would be a pisstaking expose of mutual resentment set to the tune of Cher.

“I really don’t think it’s a good idea,” stated head of media Anthony Hollingsworth.

“On top of everything so far, I don’t know if it would be a good idea.”

While previous Prime Ministers have turned Mardis Gras into a kaleidoscopic selfie opportunity, Morrison’s media advisor has strongly recommended against the PM showing up, as doing so would be enough to make Turnbull look like a genuine ally.

Despite the planned abscence during the upcoming Mardis Gras and putting the teachings of a 2000 year old book over other living humans, the Prime Minister’s office insists they are for all Australians and would like to wish all those partaking a happy Mardis Gras.

The Opposition Leader, and nation’s number one Big Bang Theory fan Bill Shorten has today asked his staffers if he could please stretch his legs.

The leader of the Labor party, who has spent the last 8 days since Parliament wrapped up in isolation, pleaded with his PR team to let him outside to play for a little while.

Shorten asked his babysitters earlier this afternoon if it would be possible for them to let him out of the room he has been locked in for over a week now, to go and have a run around.

“Please, I won’t say anything to anyone or do anything,” Shorten asked the union heavies watching over him nonchalantly while they punted on some random Victorian races on their phones.

“I swear I won’t go for a run. I’ll literally just run on the spot in the backyard for a while and then come back in here,” Shorten begged to no avail.

“I’ve watched every season of BBT twice since I’ve been there and I’m not even giggling at every Bazinga joke Sheldon makes anymore.”

It’s believed Shorten’s pleas fell on deaf ears, as his PR team explained to The Advocate that they just can’t risk letting him out in public.

“I’d give anything to go back in time and stop Kevin (Rudd) from implementing the leadership laws in the Labor Party,” said the head of the PR team.

“But I can’t, and Bill is our leader.”

After a horror few months, and with conservatives reeling after the most senior figure in the Catholic Church is now a convicted paedophile, Dutton decided today was the day Border Force let a boat through.

After his party tirelessly worked to avoid a royal commision into institutional sexual abuse, and many publicly supported the man who is set to spend the rest of his life in jail for sexual abusing children, Dutton told our reporters that urgent intervention was needed.

“It’s looking increasingly likely that I might be gone after this next election, and the government will be decimated,” said the Member for Dickson whose middle name is Craig.

“This is as dire as it’s every been, and I thought I’d seen the worst when I forgot how to count and through the entire political system into turmoil a few months ago.”

“I haven’t got any mileage out of telling people asylum seekers are going to take their spot in hospital this morning, so it’s time to get serious.”

“So I’ve told the boys to let one through.”

Dutton explained that Border Force weren’t initially that keen on skirting their duty to promote his political agenda, but eventually came round.

“Yeah, they were pretty firm on the fact that have moral and ethical duties above obligations to serve the best interests for me and the Nightwatchman, but I talked them around eventually.”

Male Heavy Liberal Party Candidate List Mistaken For Festival Line Up

As the country embraces for the upcoming federal election, several media outlets have made the embarrassing blunder of mistaking the male heavy Liberal party candidate list for an Australian festival line up.

With women making up 21 of the Coalition’s 96 sitting team members and candidates with names like Ian Goodenough and Zed Seselja, and notable female members like Julie Bishop on the way out, it was easy to mistake the list for an Australian festival line up, an error that has since been repeated by several youth media outlets.

“Wait…is Slade Brockman not one of the guys from Brockhampton?” asked radio DJ Kenny Nut-Hat.

“Michaelia Cash isn’t a rapper, is she?”

Prime Minister and lifelong Tina Arena fan Scott Morrison, defended claims of sexism by stating a Coalition festival would be “a fun day for all Australians.”

Julie Bishop Elegantly Jumps To Safety From Jet Boat Full Of C4 Hurtling Towards Gordon Dam

TEXT:

Former Minister For Foreign affairs and perennially overlooked Liberal Party stalwart, Julie Bishop has today been found safe after a very close call in South-West Tasmania’s Gordon River.

Bishop, the third-option in last year’s chaotic Lib-Spill that almost certainly spelled the death of the Coalition Government, was spotted delicately paddling to shore after diving off an out of control jet boat full of volatile explosives that was heading towards the 40-metre thick double curvature concrete arch dam at roughly 90 knots.

The outgoing Member for Curtin was seen safety diving off the back of the jet boat, leaving several of her colleagues on board after failing to persuade them to change course.

Ms Bishop was the Liberal Party’s deputy leader for 11 years, and served as Australia’s foreign minister under Tony Abbott when he announced his plans to physically assault an ex-KGB officer turned sensitive world leader, and effectively told the developed Muslim world that he thought every single one of them was in ISIS.

She was also foreign minister under Malcolm Turnbull when Peter Dutton thought that the silent majority of Australia would prefer a former highway cop facing multiple accusations of human rights violations and political corruption as their Prime Minister, a since disproven sentiment that has resulted in the 7th change in Prime Minister in 10 years.

She ran for the leadership when Mr Turnbull was deposed, but lost to The Nightwatchman.

Ms Bishop’s safe getaway from what almost certainly looks like a horrible burning wreck that has great potential to damage the environment even further, also coincides with her announcement to not recontest her blue-ribbon Western Australian Liberal safe seat in the next election.

It is believed Julie Bishop plans to take a job as the head of PR for the NRL, in an effort to escape the engrained misogyny and inappropriate conduct she has come to know in the Liberal Party.

ASIO Urges Christensen To Stop Opening Penis Enlargement Pop Ups To Prevent Future Cyberhacks

Members of Australia’s Parliament have been urged to be on high alert this week in the wake of a recent cyber attack that the Prime Minister doesn’t seem to give a fuck about.

The cyber attack was reported a few days ago, and the nation’s cyber security agencies believe was orchestrated by a foreign government, has lead to tightened security measures across all levels of parliament, and a stern talking to with Nationals MP George Christensen.

“We’ve briefed plenty of people over the last couple of days and implored them to resist temptation when it comes to opening spam emails, particularly those related to enhancing the length of one of your natural assets,” an anonymous cybersecurity official said.

“These sicko Coalition MPs are almost certainly to blame”

“This is just a smear campaign by ASIO, to try and drag my name through the mud,” an irate Christensen said from his desk.

“If they wanted to lecture anyone about it, they should be speaking to Broad.”

“I’m not concerned about my size.”

“As long as Bill’s minders don’t let him out of lockdown obviously.”

“So, unfortunately, I won’t be able to fulfill all of my commitments with the Sydney Kings to the fullest of my abilities, and as such will be resigning as Coach.”

“Because I’ll be too busy being a baller in the politics game again you know.”

Burke, however, explained that there is still everything to play for ahead of the upcoming finals series for the Kings.

“If I can take these boys to a title then I’ve got a handy little bonus in the way of an all you can eat meal at Hogs Breath and $100 Sanity gift voucher, so don’t worry Kings fans, I’m all in until I’m all out.”

Dutton Desperate For A Couple Boats To Justify The $420m Security Contract He Gave To A Mate

TEXT:

In some breaking news out of Canberra this morning, Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton has confirmed that he’d give anything for a boat right now. 

This comes after Labor looks set to scrutinise the $420 million dollars in contracts handed over to a company registered to a beach shack without a postal address.

Dutton told mainstream media yesterday that he weirdly ‘hadn’t sighted’ the huge contracts given to a random company called Paladin, to oversee Australia’s offshore detention centres that have been in the national debate for some years now.

However, in an exclusive interview with The Advocate this morning, Dutton confirmed that maybe he sort of knew who the department he is in charge of was giving 17 million dollars a month to.

“Obviously, I can’t go into the nitty-gritty too much. But I wouldn’t mind some Indonesian people smugglers trying one on, if you know what I mean,” Dutton said in his parliamentary office moments ago.

“In hindsight, I probably should have told my mates to get a generic office space in some tower in Martin Place and leave it empty, rather than let them ‘run things’ from a 2 bedroom shack on Kangaroo Island.”

“Anyway, that’s all said and done now, at the end of the day, I need a boat, and soon.”

“Two would be better.”

“I mean fuck, things are that dire for us, and for me right now, I’d take a fucking armada of them.”

“That would take the wind out of GetUp’s sails wouldn’t it.”

Dutton then told us the interview was over before asking his Chief of Staff if he could look into flights to Jakarta to give some of the human trafficking kingpins a prod along.

Morrison Alleged To Have Offered Drake Money To Hang Out With Shorten Ahead Of Election

TEXT:

A source within the Liberal party has today told The Advocate that Prime Minister Scott Morrison is finally seeing the writing on the wall.

After months of struggling to come to terms with the fact that Bill Shorten is more popular than him, The Advocate can now exclusively reveal Morrison’s grand plan to derail Bill Shorten’s Bradbury run into the number one seat.

It’s believed that Morrison has allegedly paid the Canadian rapper and universally known bad-luck charm, Drake, to befriend the opposition leader in the months leading up to the election.

We’ve been told that Morrison said there’s no other feasible way for him to win the election and that his hopes now lie fully within the cursed hands of Hotline Blingsinger.

While historically the ‘Drake Curse’ has only been recorded in the sporting arena, it’s believed that Morrison thinks it’s worth the risk of testing whether the curse transcends environments. “I’ve got no other choice” we have been told he said.

“I’ve got no other choice” we have been told he said.

The Advocate reached out to the Prime Ministers office to confirm these rumours, however we were unsuccessful.

Our reporters also reached out to Drake’s manager for confirmation and to see how much ScoMo had to pay the rapper to hang out with Shorten for 3 months, but were again unsuccessful at getting through.

Peter Dutton Urges Australians To Donate More Delicious Blood

TEXT:

Former Health Minister and professional child frightener Peter Dutton has made a plea to Australian’s everywhere to step up and ‘donate more delicious blood.’

For this reason, the MP has decided to ask Australian’s to do more than just pay tax that might trickle-down to hospitals but to prepare their veins and donate their own blood.

“The situation is dire, the hospital I was just at ran out of blood while I was there, coincidentally,” stated Dutton at an indoor press conference.

“Your plump juicy bodies must be relieved of the additional strain of the rich, red blood that runs through your hot, pumping veins.”

In response to his comments, Shadow Health Minister Catherine King said today that Dutton cares more about the Australian healthcare system now than when he was Health Minister and that he ‘should take a good hard look in the mirror,” – an assertion Dutton laughed at, before twirling his cape and running off stage.

ScoMo Concedes Election Campaign Is ‘Pretty Much’ His Gardening Leave

TEXT:

The Prime Nightwatchman Of Australia has all but confirmed that his reelection campaign this year realistically amounts to gardening leave.

The term gardening leave means an employee’s suspension from work on full pay for the duration of a notice period, typically to prevent them from having any further influence on the organisation or from accessing confidential information.

When that was put to him this morning at a press conference outside Lilli Pilli Pies in Sydney’s cosmopolitan Caringbah district, Scott Morrison laughed and put his chunky steak dogs eye down and rolled his eyes.

“Yeah,” he coughed in an outdoorsman’s voice.

“Sounds like it, doesn’t it? Things are looking grim, the economy is going to shit itself by Christmas and it won’t be my fault. I’m not fussed, though. I’m going to get reelected forever, this is Cronulla. But the other creeps who put me in here like Kevin ‘Salad Fingers’ Andrews and Tony Abbott are in the hot sauce,”

“Speaking of hot sauce, could one of you useless fucks run inside and get me some Sriracha? I’m in the mood to blow my socks off.”

The Nightwatchman’s Visit To Townsville Rendered Pointless After No One Even Sees Him There

TEXT:

Scott Morrison’s executive decision to fly a private jet to the flood-ravaged North Queensland capital has been described a ‘waste of time’ by his office, after his poor choice of clothing left him completely invisible to the untrained eye.

Aside from a few seasoned AJs from the Townsville barracks, almost no one in Townsville noticed that the Prime Minister had visited to disaster zone.

Hundreds of people remain stuck in evacuation centres across Townsville waiting for floodwaters to recede as the relentless Norht Queensland rains continue into their 12th day.

The one-in-100-year monsoonal deluge is far from over with the Bureau of Meteorology warning more heavy rain is likely from Palm Island, north of Townsville, south to Mackay on Wednesday.

However, these lesser North Queensland towns are of no interest to the Nightwatchman on his unofficial campaign trail. With his office noting that fuck all people live outside of Townsville.

Morrison’s choice of camouflaged military PPE marks the first time a sitting Prime Minister has worn full blown army kit, ever, including John Curtin, who was Prime Minister during World War II when the Japanese were literally bombing Townsville.

The PM’s office have given comment regarding the ill-fated trip, with a spokesperson stating that Morrison’s media team now regret organising the camo jacket for the Prime Minister’s photoshoot.

Namely, because it would have been a good opportunity for the Nightwatchman to actually introduce himself to the punters up north, most of whom still think the Prime Minister.

Clive Palmer Accidentally Sends Text Message Meant For His Media Advisor To 10 Million People

TEXT:

Just a day after political candidate Clive Palmer flew to the Menindee Lakes to help clean up the environmental disaster that is the mass fish kill, with a deep fryer and a couple bags of frozen chips – it appears the North Queensland mining magnate is back in the headlines.

This time for sending yet another unsolicited text.

This week alone we have seen Palmer texting campaign promises to millions of voters without their permission,

Yesterday’s text landed at 7.47am, and was ironically pledging to ban unsolicited texts.

“When elected, United Australia Party will ban unsolicited political text messages which Labor & Liberal have allowed,” it read.

Today’s text, however, appears to have been not even ironic, and more of a mistake.

This text read:

“Oi what was the name of that restaurant on the way to Canberra from Sydney that does the satay pasta. Fuk that was good”

Palmer has since addressed today’s text message, stating that it was meant for his media advisor, who’s name is Evan.

“It was an easy mistake to make, and a costly one too. At 6 cents a text…”

“Anyway, I apologise for the third one but not the two others. To be honest I’m just getting really excited to get elected again and want to see if all my favourite haunts are still open”

“For the record, the restaurant’s name is the Paragon Cafe in Goulburn. It’s incredible”

Nationals Facing Another Sex Scandal As Canavan Continues To Blatantly Fuck The Barrier Reef

TEXT:

A tough week just got a lot tougher this morning for the National Party, after another one of its Parliamentarians became embroiled in a sex scandal.

In an explosive turn of events, The Betoota Advocate can exclusively reveal today that the Queensland Senator and Federal Resources Minister Matt Canavan has been having an extra-marital affair for the last couple of years.

Canavan admitted this morning that he has been cheating on his wife and fucking the Great Barrier Reef since he became the Resources Minister in 2016.

This revelation comes after Andrew Broad was outed for his behaviour overseas, behaviour which will see him stand down at the next election, and the behaviour of Barnaby Joyce which came to a head earlier this year.

However, while Andrew Broad is legally trying to change his name to James Bond and is looking forward to a future of driving around in flash cars and drinking Martinis, it isn’t yet known what decision Canavan will make regarding his future.

Canavan told us that he hadn’t made a decision, but wasn’t ashamed of what he had done to one of the World’s Natural Wonders.

“I love my wife and my family, but I don’t regret working for the resources industry, pushing the Adani mine through, actively denying climate change, criticizing future generations for their keen interest in the planet in which they want to live on and doing my best to destroy the world-renowned coral eco-system off our coast,” Canavan said.

“The world tried to stop me from fornicating the Reef with the whole Italian citizenship thing, but they could keep us apart.”

“If I had my time I would do it all over again,” he said tearfully before walking out of the interview.

Morrison Asks National Party Rooting Machines To Rein It In Until After Election

TEXT:

Prime Minister Scott Morrison has today pleaded with members of the National Party to just ease up with their members for a bit.

The nation’s blokiest bloke made the call today following the announcement by Andrew Broad that he wouldn’t be contesting the next election due to the ‘Sugar Bady’ scandal.

The heartthrob from Mallee who scolded Barnaby for his own scandal earlier this year, decided not to contest the next election after details of his activity during work funded travel overseas emerged this week.

While Broad is reportedly considering making a run at becoming the next Bond in the long-running franchise, the embattled Prime Minister has asked him to rein it in until after the election.

Speaking to The Advocate this afternoon, Morrison confirmed the conversation took place.

“Look, I think I’ve told you this before, but I’m as a fair dinkum a bloke as they come right,” Morrison said.

“And I get what’s gone on. When you are strapping young rooster like Andrew, it happens sometimes, but I really need these rooting machines to keep it in their pants until mid-way through next year.”

The nation’s caretaker PM said he hopes the message got through.

“I’ve got a pretty stiff task ahead of me here, and my life’s not going to be made any easier if these swooners are making headlines during the campaign, so hopefully they just cool off a bit.”

Parliament Now Just A Place For Losers To Get A Little Action

While ICAC raids the NSW Labor party headquarters, another federal Coalition frontbencher resigns from politics over using taxpayer money to in his unsuccessful efforts to wine, dine and sixty-nine a woman nearly twenty years his junior – many voters have had to ask themselves – what the fuck do these people even do?

With pretty much every proposed social policy since Julia Gillard blocked for years by fickle backbenchers, until they are forced through a weird non-binding national vote, it has become clear that, in Australia, higher office is just a place that seems to offer nerdy youth politicians access to the power structure and unjustifiably large tax free income that they believe is required to appeal to the opposite sex.

With decades worth of whispers that indicate a culture of non-stop rooting in the halls of Parliament House, it is a relief to know that even egotistical losers with limited social skills or any understanding of life outside of youth politics Summer camps and party room sniping, can find someone willing to have sex with them.

Or at least find someone who is willing to sext them, even if they aren’t interested in anything physical or being told g’day mate during sex. As was the case of Nationals MP Andrew Broad.

“It’s a real culture issue” tweeted Laurie Oakes, former Canberra news juggernaut and prominent smooth operator.

“None of these losers know how to pick up babes in the real world lol.”

National Party Say Andrew Broad’s Hypocrisy Is A Private Family Matter

The farmer from Mallee allegedly text the woman saying he knew ‘how to fuck his woman’ and constantly referred to himself as James Bond during dinner conversation.

Speaking to reporters earlier this morning the leader of the National Party Michael McCormack explained that the Andrew Broad issue is currently a private family matter.

However, the leader of the party that campaigned against the legalisation of same-sex marriage on the basis that it would undermine traditional family values explained that Broad’s extra-marital activities are not a matter for public scrutiny.

“Andrew’s current situation is a matter for him and his family and his privacy should be respected,” said McCormack who reportedly knew of Broads activity nearly a month ago.

“What people do in their private time is not a matter for public debate, unless they are same-sex attracted couples who want to get married.”

“So in the spirit of good will, I would ask you to leave the man who has lectured people about traditional family values in the past to conduct extra-marital relations in private away from the public eye.”

Broad declined to comment on the story this morning simply saying he would ‘die another day.’

National Party Confirms 007 Pick Up Lines Don’t Work In Real Life

TEXT:

The National Party has today admitted that James Bond related pick up lines don’t work very well in real life.

This comes after Nationals MP Andrew Broad resigned from the Morrison Ministry today as a result of ‘sex scandal allegations’ coming to light.

The allegations came to light after a 20-year-old woman called Amy leaked messages and details regarding her meeting up with Broad for dinner in Hong Kong.

The woman alleges that Andrew Broad said: “Im an Aussie lad, I know how to ride a horse, fly a plane and f–k my woman. My intentions are completely dishonourable,” via text message before reportedly referring to himself as James Bond over the course of the meal.

Broad’s allegedly incredibly cringe-worthy and painful comments have forced the National Party to confirm today that 007 lines aren’t a great idea under any circumstances.

“Jesus Christ,” said the leader of the Nationals Michael McCormack.

“I’m not sure why riding a horse or driving a plane is particularly alluring but acting like your Pierce fucking Brosnan or Daniel Craig is an appalling idea.”

“Especially when you are a farmer-come-federal politician from based in North Western Victoria.”

‘Haha Wimps’ Says Australia’s Parliament

TEXT:

The two major political parties in Australia have confirmed today that they’ve been very entertained by the events in the UK over the last 24 hours.

Speaking to The Advocate a short time ago, the two party’s leaders said there has been a bit of laughter about what’s transpired in the halls of Westminster.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Opposition Leader Bill Shorten explained that they couldn’t believe how gutless their British counterparts were.

Bill Shorten, the leader of the ALP who started the whole coup culture thing explained that he actually agreed with Morrison on this issue.

“There’s nothing wrong with knocking off a sitting Prime Minister because it’s the flavour of the month and creating a climate of uncertainty for the indefinite future, unless it’s me of course,” he said.

“How pathetic from the Brits to just stick with one leader.”

“And take my word for it because Sco-Mo and I don’t agree on many things, apart from a lot of elements of border protection, the new encryption laws, and so on, so it must be a common sense thing to just change Prime Minister every year,” Shorten said.

He then randomly asked our reporter what their favourite type of lettuce was in some weird attempt to make conversation outside of politics.

Morrison did indeed echo Shorten’s sentiments on the issue a short time ago.

“Owww scary, we better not roll our leader and cause widespread destabilisation and disarray within our government and our country,” said Morrison making crying eyes with his hands and pulling a funny face before bursting into laughter.

“Watch out, we better not change Prime Ministers again for the sake of it,” he then said in a baby voice before losing himself to uncontrollable giggles again.

“Seriously though, I’m a fair dinkum bloke and I just don’t get how they can be so piss weak.”

Dutton Blames Democratic Process For Getting In The Way Of Him Being Way More Helpful

TEXT:

Peter Dutton has pleaded with the country to scrap it’s parliamentary democracy today, imploring Australians that he would be able to do so much more if he didn’t have to muck around with all the bureaucracy.

The Home Affairs Minister told Sky News earlier that parliament is “a disadvantage for sitting governments,” and has now gone one step further and floated the idea of scrapping it all together.

“How much better would it be if we (the government) just got elected and then just got to do heaps of cool stuff for 3 or 4 years without all the hassle of parliament,” he said to our reporters.

The former cop from the Sunshine State who isn’t very good at counting when he is under pressure explained that the country would be so much better of if blokes like he and Sco-Mo just had free reign without any checks and balances or transparency.

“If we didn’t have to do the whole parliament thing imagine how much helpful I could be? Nauru would be sorted, the encryption thing wouldn’t be a big deal, anyone who looks like a terrorist would be deported, this country would be humming.”

“Bill Shorten just caves on most of the shit we want to do anyway, so it really is a disadvantage having to go down to the hell hole that is Canberra to sit.”

Dutton admitted that it’s probably unrealistic to expect the country to do away with a pillar of its democracy but said it was something that we should think about.

“I don’t know, it would just be so much cooler that way,” he said.

Barnaby Joyce is back in the headlines today after calling for a Royal Commission into a ‘pressing issue.’

Speaking earlier today the Former Deputy Prime Minister and Kiwi citizen, called for an inquiry into ‘what the fuck’s going on with the new Carlton Dry bottles.’

The maverick MP from New England told our reporters that it was time something was done regarding the issue.

“The nation is entitled to know who the fuck came up with this idea of the Ring Pull,” a fired-up Joyce said.

“I mean, as everyone already knows, I’m a ‘New’ man (Tooheys) through and through, but that isn’t influencing my stance on this issue. This is a matter of public interest.”

“I mean, what faded cut jeans and trendy New Balance wearing marketing genius came up with this idea?”

“The ring pull is for Bundaberg Ginger Beer and their other varieties of bubbly pop water, and that’s it.”

The aspiring leader of the National Party explained that there were so many other disturbing facets of the chance of bottle top that it nothing less than a Royal Commission would suffice.

“How is anyone supposed to pop the top off a bottle and do the thumb finger flick of the top across the room at someone?”

“And then there’s the whole fact that they’ve gone ahead and reduced the size of the bottle from 355 ml to 330 ml which I don’t need to explain, is an affront to the nation.”

“If Morrison is as fair dinkum a bloke as he tells us numerous times every single day, then he’ll call a Royal Commission into this mess now.”

Barnaby Joyce then ruled out waiting on Shorten to push it through next year.

“He’s a real middy kind of guy, isn’t he? I reckon he is probably a fan of the smaller bottle sizes.”

Peter Dutton Spends The Night Reading Through All Of The Group Chats He Got Kicked Out Of

Peter Dutton has turned up at work this morning after a sleepless night.

The Minister for Home Affairs didn’t manage to drift off because he was kept awake at night by the appalling treatment of offshore detainees, or because of his role in completely and utterly castrating the government, but lay awake through the night because he was reading through all of the group chats he got kicked out of.

This comes after an agreement was reached on new national security laws by the two major parties yesterday, to allow authorities to intercept encrypted messages.

While Mr Dutton originally argued that the new laws were necessary because 95% of people watched by domestic spy authorities were using encrypted message apps, The Betoota Advocate can exclusively reveal this morning that the cop from Queensland had an ulterior motive.

That motive was to be able to gain access to all of the chats he was kicked out off after his failed bid at the Liberal Party leadership in August.

Mr Dutton explained that now the laws have been passed he is doing his best jealous partner impression by snooping through any chats he can get his hands on.

“My first order was to get access to ‘Leadership Dudes 2k18’ again and it makes for some disturbing reading,” Mr Dutton said to us.

“Why are they talking about keeping me in the background as much as possible? And who the fuck is Josh Frydenberg to be giving me shit about my noggin? He’s almost as bald as the tires on a 2008 Nissan Skyline in Caboolture.”

Australia Gasps As Politician Does Something She Promised To Do Before Being Elected

Australian voters are in a state of shock today, after Kerryn Phelps MP begins doing something that she was talking about doing before she was elected in early November.

The independent Member For Wentworth is leading a push from the growing parliamentary crossbench to evacuate refugee children and sick adults from Manus Island and Nauru.

As the former leader of the AMA, Phelps campaigned for a medical evacuation of unwell detainees, as per the advice of just about every doctor in Australia.

Phelps, who took her seat in parliament for the first time this week, was joined by crossbench colleagues on Thursday to announce the thing she promised to do.

She was joined by fellow independent Andrew Wilkie and greens MP Adam Bandt, plus senator Derryn Hinch, Tim Storer and Nick McKim.

Kerryn Phelps said it was “urgent” that refugees on Manus and Nauru receive better medical treatment, and this is something that she promised Wentworth voters that she would do before the election, so now she is doing it.

This kind of efficiency and commitment to an issue has rattled Australian voters, who are used to flat out being lied to by politicians, who end up doing fuck all after getting elected.

“What the fuck is going on?” asked one punter, Brian (60) from Capalaba.

“These politicians don’t operate like that. Who’s behind her? Who’s funding this?”

Another voter, Kaleene (44) thought that Kerryn Phelps might run out of steam soon, if she keeps working this hard.

“Slow down Kerryn!” she said.

After the party was rocked with internal accusations surrounding both assaults and the subsequent protection of, or indifference towards, alleged perpetrators, thousands of young privileged white hipsters are distraught that they can no longer claim moral absolution.

“Don’t get me wrong. I am 100% a feminist” says Richie Mund (27) a well-known vocal campaigner and son of two career public servants in high-paid and secure bureaucratic positions within either the ABC or the state library.

“But there’s got to be a point when, you know, people are just using the #MeToo movement to stop us from achieving our end goal. Which is to force the Australian public to have frustrating and poorly articulated debate about gender theory in primary schools”

“Not to mention, all the data we’ve been gathering on how kangaroos are nearly extinct”

Richie says that while the #MeToo movement is very important for holding AFL stars and b-list actors accountable for their treatment of women, he never thought it would get to the point where he was unable to talk over people at dinner parties.

“Like, I know plenty of examples were the accusations aren’t true and are just being used by unpaid volunteers to bring down certain politicians within our party that they have given so much time and energy to see succeed”

Richie has no doubt that some of the lesser-ranked females, who’s names he didn’t know until they inconveniently accused high-profile Greens identities of sexual harassment, have a sinister agenda.

“Who knows what they are up to. It can’t just be about wanting to air out the traumatic experiences they’ve suffered at the hands of these guys” he says.

The Federal something of the nation, Josh Frydenberg, opened a joint press conference this morning with the Prime Minister with a plea to the nation to call him by his new nickname.

“Call me ‘JoFry’,” said the 47-year-old.

Scott Morrison, the Federal ScoMo of the nation, laughed for the cameras and slapped him on the back.

“Nice dude,” said Scott.

“Ok my dudes, let’s talk about my main girl JBanks. That’s what we [sic] all here for, right?”

“Ok so, yo. She is tripping when she says that us Liberinos aren’t down with the dudettes. We totally are. Me and my girl Julia McBishop Bishopface play tennis all the time.

Man That Insisted Banking Royal Commission Was Unnecessary Insists Federal ICAC Is Unnecessary

TEXT:

Prime Minister Scott Morrison has today moved to assure the country that we aren’t in need of a Federal style ICAC at all.

The man who previously labelled calls for a Royal Commission into the Banking and Financial Sector a “populist whinge,” explained that everything in federal politics is ship shape corruption wise.

The PM’s comments come after a number of cross benchers look to push legislation through establishing a federal style ICAC.

Morrison, who vigorously opposed a Banking Royal Commission, which subsequently revealed widespread immoral and criminal conduct across the industry, told The Advocate today that the ‘public don’t have anything to worry about.’

“Look, in this country, the greatest country on earth if I do say so myself, you’ve gotta (sic) be able to take a bloke on his word, and trust his word,” Morrison said.

“Now, I’m as fair dinkum as they come, and I can tell you hand on heart, that there is nothing untoward going on in federal politics to warrant an anti-corruption commission being set up.”

“Just like there was nothing crook happening in the banking industry. So setting up a Federal ICAC would just be a giant waste of time.”

Morrison then explained that even though state politics has been riddled with high profile cases of corruption, there is nothing to worry about at a national level.

“Trust me, it’s all squeaky clean. And if it wasn’t we’d be calling it out and reporting it to the authorities without a doubt.”

ScoMo Forced To Buy New Bed For Victorian Liberals Who Shit In Theirs Over Weekend

ScoMo, the Prime Minister of Australia, has taken time out of his busy afternoon of sheepishly laughing and creating jobs to visit a Canberra Captain Snooze shop to buy a big new bed for the Victorian Liberals who got up on theirs over the weekend, pulled their britches down and shit on the bare mattress.

Witnesses described the scene as the man in the top job waltzed through the doors of the Fyshwick outlet store.

“Plastic sheets this time, too!” laughed Scott as he slammed the bottomless tax-payer funded Diners Club card down on the counter.

“Maybe they’re into that type of thing down in Melbourne? It strikes me as a real plastic sheet town. Those home job Northcote haircuts. Them ding ding buses on the road rails! By golly, get me out of that place!”

“Anyway, hope it’s the last time they shit the bed down there. What would Malcolm Fraser do now? Probably give me a dressing down verbally then choke me out! He was a strong man. Well built! Holy Dooley! He could twist the top off a stubbie before they even made twist tops! So my message to the Victorian Liberals is please stop doing numbers twos in the bedrooms!”

Liberal Party’s Base Found To Be Just These Four Old White People Bickering In Local Cafe

The previously unseen Liberal Party base has been discovered in a local cafe today.

Four Betoota Grove Baby Boomers, who all moonlight as economic, social and environmental handbrakes on our nation, were observed by researchers from the CSIRO bickering in the Steaks de Cheval Cafe in the French Quarter.

For the first time in years, according to Australia’s peak scientific body.

“We were in town to record bird numbers. And then we stumbled upon this! That’s such a CSIRO thing to do! People have said the Liberal Party base doesn’t really exist, however,” said the public servant.

“But the base reportedly got Malcolm turfed and every Tom, Dick and Dutton in the Liberal Party has been trying to appease this base so they’d keep their vote,”

“Nobody was convinced, they said the base is just a figment of their imagination! Well, as it turns out, we are the dumb cunts in this instance. There they are. Four old white people bickering about something. There you have it, Australia.”

The Advocate went down to the Steaks de Cheval to see what all the fuss was about but one of the boomers had a fall while attempting to use the bathroom.

Ambulance crews were preventing people from entering the cafe.

“Landslide Loss In Victoria Nothing To Be Concerned About” Says Third PM In Four Years

TEXT:

The Liberal Party’s woeful result in the Victorian election indicated that the Morrison government will be torn to piece at next year’s federal poll, as a blame game begins within both state and federal party rooms in an attempt to explain how the most uncharismatic man in Australian politics was able to jag another term as Victoria’s Premier.

Daniel Andrews cleaned up on yesterday’s election following a spike in votes to Labor in a many unexpected seats across the state, including marginal electorates held by the Liberals.

However, Prime Minister Morrison has said the Victorian election is simply a one-off, and like the Wentworth By-Election, it’s not at all indicative of how the rest of the country will vote in a couple of months.

“This is a fair dinkum anomaly” said Prime Minister Morrison.

“It’s simple. The Victorian people are out of touch with the rest of Australia. This isn’t anything to worry about”

“The same with the people of Wentworth. They are too elite to be able to relate to the policies of the Liberal Party, which aims to mostly serve a distinct brand of kind of racist upper middle class male climate change denier who think we should have prayers in schools”

The third Prime Minister in four years then paused for a minute before going full Scomo.

“This government is 100% true blue in the fair dinkum department and as dinki-di as a bunch of ANZACS playing Aussie Rules on the shores of Gallipoli after defeating the Turks.”

“There is nothing to worry about… We’ve got this!”

Dutton Furious After Canberra Waitress Accidentally Garnishes His Bald Head With Rosemary

TEXT:

A Canberra 457-visa worker is at risk of being deported home today, after mistaking the Minister For Home Affairs’ bald head for a kiplfer spud side dish.

It is believed the member for Dixon was furious after discovering the embarrassing incident wasn’t even a joke.

“Oh ma gosh!” said the North English backpacker.

“Um honest I thought yer head was part of the ferst coorse”

This marks yet another embarrassing headline for the Home Affairs Minister, following a year that he, and many of his colleagues, are excited to see behind them.

Starting with of course his failed bid for Prime Minister that saw him fly his young family down from North Brisbane on the night of the long knives, only to be robbed of the chance to give a victory speech after yet another Eastern Suburbs silverfox pipped him for the job.

However, sources closes to Dutton say that having his head mistaken for a baked potato isn’t even the most embarrassing thing that has happened to him this week, after the Courier Mail reported that yet another refugee that arrived in Australia by boat had duxed her entire high school and also finished her Australian pre-tertiary education as school captain.

“He’ll be alright” said the party insider.

Turnbull’s Morning Ruined By Facebook ‘On This Day’ Update

TEXT:

According to unnamed sources, former Prime Minister and multi-millionaire Malcolm Turnbull, was enjoying his morning of relaxation until receiving a Facebook ‘On this day’ update that reminded him that he used to be Prime Minister.

No longer having to pretend he is ‘one of the people’ Malcolm Turnbull was enjoying a glass of Penfolds with his wife Lucy when he paused to check Facebook while they waited for their caviar and truffle sliders to arrive.

Bar patrons state it was about this point that Turnbull cried “Aaah, for fuck’s sake,” and slammed his iPhone X to the table breaking the screen.

Upon being asked to leave Turnbull wrote a cheque to buy the bar with plans to ask everyone to vacate the premises and fire the person who had just ask him to leave. Security escorted him and Lucy from the premises with witnesses stating he audibly dragged his wheelie bag as he left.

Once outside, the aspiring monarch confided in his wife how the computer generated Facebook post had hurt his feelings by reminding him of his brief tenure as one of the nation’s most forgettable leaders.

“It was about that time we fought for marriage equality, remember that?” he asked, stating the time he asked the entire nation to vote on something that was already pretty clear-cut.

“I’d like to see Morrison do that. Tit.”

Turnbull was later spotted ranting as he walked, stopping to share his problem’s with a homeless man who asked him for change.

“I worked so hard to get to the top,” spat the former PM.

When the homeless person continued to ask for money the former PM cited a time where he gave $5 to a homeless man in Australia before heading off for some “me time.”

PM Responds To Pamela Anderson’s Accusations Of Misogyny With ‘Reow’ Noise

Scott Morrison has fired back in the diplomatic row with Canadian-American actress and model Pamela Anderson today.

The Prime Minister was blasted by the Baywatch star for his “smutty” and “lewd” comments about her this week.

In response to calls from Anderson to look after Julian Assange and bring him home,  Morrison said earlier this week that he “plenty of mates who’ve asked me if they can be my special envoy to sort the issue out with Pamela Anderson.

However, rather than apologising for his offensive comments the PM has this afternoon decided to escalate the spat, by making ‘Reow’ noises and hand movements when commenting on the issue.

When asked by reporters about whether he had anything else to say in response to Anderson’s comments, Morrison started making the cat-like noises and laughing while glancing at any white middle-aged men around the room.

“Pamela Anderson, Reoooowwwwwww,” he said before bursting into laughter.

“Fiesty one isn’t she?”

“Don’t get your knickers in a knot over it love,” said Morrison in his most dismissive and blokey voice yet

“Geez Louise, Pamela global diplomacy isn’t one of your strengths.”

Knowing what was coming, the reporters in the room sighed and shook their heads.

“I think we all know what her bests strengths are,” Morrison said before making ‘googly’ eyes and pushing his chest forward.

Bursting into laughter again Morrison then explained that he was ‘fair dinkum on this issue,’ and would be touching base with ‘Pam’ to see if they can work the whole thing out.

Bill Shorten Misses The Mark With Season Two Big Bang Theory Reference

TEXT:

The country’s Opposition Leader has left a group of people standing around awkwardly today.

The uncomfortable situation occurred a short time ago when Bill Shorten decided to drop a Season Two Big Bang Theory reference into a conversation with a number of people.

Conversing about some federal Labor policy with a couple of staffers and some other Canberra type people, the Opposition leader decided to throw in a one-liner from American sitcom The Big Bang Theory, a show popular with middle-aged dads for some reason.

“Haha that’s like that time Sheldon schooled Raj about Klingon,” laughed Shorten making some vague connection to a new policy he is planning to announce.

While a couple of the group sharply inhaled through their teeth and looked around, a couple of Shorten’s advisors made the effort to half laugh for a couple of seconds.

Already uncomfortable, Shorten then reportedly followed up the reference with one of the show’s catchphrases.

“Bazinga!” he said before walking off chortling to himself and shaking his head at the people who didn’t get the joke.

One of the staffers present told us that Shorten is partial to a ‘Bazinga’ far too often.

“Bill’s got a poster of Sheldon saying ‘Bazinga’ in his office. He loves the show. He always asks one of us to put it on when we fly,” the staffer said.

“I think he thinks we are all basic normies because we ‘don’t get the humour.”

“Obviously we have to entertain him and go along with it all, but it’s tough, very tough to laugh when he hits someone with a Bazinga mid-conversation.”

“Haha, Nah” Say Government MPs In Response To Calls For A Federal Corruption Watchdog

TEXT:

The Colaition has today explained to The Advocate why a Federal Independent Commission Against Corruption, or similar watchdog type body isn’t necessary.

“Listen here, us blokes don’t have anything to hide, and therefore we don’t need a Federal body to investigate any behaviour that may be deemed suspicious,” said Prime Minister Scott Morrison in his most blokey voice.

“Our Federal politicians are incredibly honest, moral, and trusted human beings who are able to regulate themselves and hold themselves accountable,” he said.

“Trust us,” he laughed.

“Oh I mean, there’s been a few scandals here and there regarding dodgy payments and political appointments, but it’s all hot air.”

The Prime Minister explained that the former Trade Minister Andrew Robb, who helped a Chinese company gain the lucrative 99 year Port of Darwin lease; before quitting politics and walking into a casual 880k consultancy gig with the same company just days after quitting politics, was an appointment based on merit.

“No way anything crook happened there boys. He definitely got that job based upon merit. Just like a lot of politicians who land plumb gigs straight after politics, he got it because he is really good at stuff, not because he may have been doing any favours,” Morrison said.

Shorten confirmed to us that he would begrudgingly support calls for a Federal ICAC.

“I have to just say the opposite of what the PM says. I mean, if I’m totally honest with you, we’ve avoided it for as long as possible, but I don’t think we can get away with it anymore considering how crooked our state pollies have been across the country,” Shorten said.

“It’s a bit annoying that the crossbenchers and the Greens are carrying on actually,” he said.

“They are just jealous that mining, business, and finance companies and property developers don’t ask their politicians to do them favours.”

Morrison Backflips On Initial Idea Of Letting People Starve To Death

TEXT:

The Coalition Government’s Nightwatchman has reversed a funding cut to one of Australia’s largest hunger-relief organisations, after ‘listening to the community’.

While making bizarre media appearance on the day time variety program Studio 10 on Monday morning, Mr Morrison said the government had maintained the level of funding for food support services, but that it was now being distributed among three charities – he has since changed his tune.

“I’ve decided that I will not allow people to starve to death under my watch” said Morrison this morning.

“I’ve been told it’s a bad look”

“That was a close one haha”

Foodbank, which supplies essential food products such as rice, bread and vegetables to hungry people, has had its annual funding reduced from $750,000 to $427,000 – with news of the cut coming just weeks before Christmas.

The National Farmers’ Federation, the community sector and Labor yesterday slammed the Government’s plans to slash Foodbank’s funding in half from January.

Yesterday, Morrison defended proposed funding cuts the charity that feeds 710,000 Australians a month, but said he is open to a review of the decision.

He has since changed his stance, after community backlash from voters and different organisations who were of the opinion that letting people starve to death is kinda mean.

“You might be wondering why I’m not wearing a suit today,” he laughed.

“But I treated myself on the Lords Day to some new artwork,” he said, motioning his arm to our reporters.

“So I thought I’d show it off. Oh, and because wearing a dress shirt over the top of the new ink would have caned all day.”

“Got my cousins mate down in the Shire to draw it up and do it yesterday. Tooking him like 6 hours aye, but I reckon he’s done a real good job on it,” Morrison laughed.

The new relatable Australian male friendly artwork comes after the Government took another hit in the two-party preferred polls, to trail Labor 45-55.

The PM’s Media Advisor then exclusively told The Advocate that Morrison got the depiction of God of Greek Mythology, as part of his sustained and prolonged campaign to appear like an ‘average Aussie bloke.’

“Sco-Mo got the work done because he just wants to show the people that he is just a run of the mill, beer and BBQ loving bloke on half a million dollars a year.”

Latham will run for NSW Parliment and lead the state branch of One Nation.

The former leader of the Labor Party has told reporters that he is thinking about taking time out of his busy schedule out of bashing taxi drivers and abusing people on Twitter to cast himself back into public life.

ScoMo Still Yet To Be Called Out For Giving Himself A Nickname

TEXT:

Although Prime Minister of Australia and professional seat warmer Scott Morrison has been the nation’s leader since August 2018, the nation is wondering exactly when he will be called out for giving himself the nickname ‘ScoMo.’

Since being sworn in, the PM has received a lot of criticism from the public for his focus on religious discrimination, lack of action on climate change and being the sort of person who says “spendings thanks” when paying on card, but has managed to dodge criticism relating to the fact that he was definitely the first person to refer to him as ‘ScoMo.’

Traditionally used to belittle someone you care about, nicknames can be an essential part of belonging to a group, which is why it seems highly unlikely that a Liberal Prime Minister would have one, let alone one they like and use on social media.

A spokesperson from the PM’s office rejects the claims the member for Cook came up with his own nickname, stating the nickname was “actually started by someone cool like Banksy or something” and that it was previously “DJ ScoMo until he left that life behind.”

A source from inside the Liberal party, Patrick Dutton (real name changed), confirmed Prime Minister Morrison does have a nickname they all use, just never to his face.

“It starts with a C,” stated the featureless whistle blower.

Political Movement Named After 20-Year-Old Sci-Fi Movie Surprisingly Made Up Of Nerdy Virgins

TEXT:

Prominent Federal Labor MPs have called on the Government to deny a visa to Gavin McInnes, the founder of the controversial white male supremacist organisation, The Proud Boys, who is due to visit Australia in November, to remind dorky kids with preppy haircuts that they too matter. Even if their dad left the family during his formative years.

“Proud Boys” is a far-right organisation which admits only men as members and promotes political violence,” the letter reads.

However, while the leader of well-dressed sect of Men Rights activism appears to be still able to visit Australia from his home in America, which is usually the place where these obscure political movements form – the edgier, less sexually active movement of the ‘red pillers’ appears to be growing by the day in our country.

The red-pillers, who believe men are being emasculated by the concept of equality that has seen women progress past them based on merit, while still favouring women when it comes to custody battles and victim statements.

The name refers to a scene in the film The Matrix, in which the protagonist is offered the choice of a red pill, representing truth and self-knowledge, or a blue pill representing a return to blissful ignorance. By analogy it seeks to bring awareness to the contrast between men’s rights and what they perceive as favouritism to women.

“It actually shouldn’t be a surprise that this movement is made up of nerds” says Professor Lote Meninga, from the Anthropological Department of Western QLD University.

“Like, for men who have never, ever had sex, and will likely never have sex.. They seem weirdly obsessed with the family courts”

Bill Shorten’s Slightly Charismatic Twin Brother Accused Of Hogging All The Personality

TEXT:

Robert Shorten has been thrust into the limelight today.

This comes after allegations surfaced that the twin brother of the Opposition leader Bill Shorten, stole all of the Labor leader’s personality.

Arguably one of Labor’s best-kept secrets, it is believed that the personality hogging has been taking place since the Shortens’ early teens.

Rob Shorten who has been known to regale his friends and colleagues with the odd tale about his triathlons, also reportedly takes a keen interest in reality TV, novelty socks, cufflinks and extra large flat whites.

It has been a long-held medical theory that throughout history that twins often have half the personality of single birth children.

Dr John Paul, The Head of Paediatrics at Royal Betoota Base Hospital, however, explained that it has never been scientifically clear how exactly the splitting of personality actually occurs.

“What we often see is a 75-25 or 70-30 kind of split in terms of personality with twins,” Dr Paul said.

“The Shortens’ are a particularly interesting case though. Because I can’t see how you make up the 100%. I mean Rob, who has a sliver of charisma seems to have the 70%, which would seemingly leave Bill with the remaining 30%.”

“However, I have got no idea where that 30% went, as Bill actually has no personality. It’s a bit of a scientific anomaly really.”

Dr Paul said that there may be the possibility that Rob started hogging it all during teenage years and never stopped.

His Chief Of Staff then told us that ever since Malcolm has refused to offer any public statements, Mr Shorten has been lost for words.

“It’s been really difficult for Bill. Just saying the opposite of what Malcolm says is very hard now,” the staffer said.

“We are working through it though.”

“So I thought I need to copy the suit of a few of my mates, and just get an au pair in from Europe,” he said.

“A hot one of course.”

“The obvious path to making that happen would have been through the Honourable Member for Dickson. Everyone knows that he is the man to call for these sorts of things,” McSwillion said.

However, McSwillion explained that with all that has occurred over the last few months, he has been hesitant about picking up the phone.

“But I think it’s been long enough know. Hopefully it’s all blown over and Peter can get a visa for a good looking young woman of fair complexion pushed through.”

“I mean, if he can’t, well what has this good country come to.”

Government Rolls Out Emergency Aid Package For Instagram Influencers Following Too Much Rain

TEXT:

Sticking true to his ungracious words on Saturday following the by-election disaster of Wentworth, Prime Minister Morrison got on the front foot this morning.

With an election campaign looming and negative press abound, the daggy dad dubbed Sco-Mo has decided to roll out a brand spanking new package.

In a big move, the Prime Minister announced this morning a 102 million dollar package to help rain affected Instagram influencers.

The package comes after a horror run of rain and miserable weather has thrown the Instagram industry into turmoil.

With day after day of cloudy skies and heavy rain, many of the nation’s entrepreneurs who ply their trade through posting bikini-clad photos near the ocean with cheeky yet clever captions about the weather, work or food have been struggling.

The package will be rolled out over the coming weeks through a variety of different channels.

Prime Minister Morrison speaking at a press conference this morning explained why the much-needed aid will be rolled out.

“This country is built on people who want to work. And with this horrible miserable weather, thousands of our young women have been cooped up indoors, unable to make a crust,” Morrison said.

“So we will be providing some vital aid to these young women, who in a way are the lifeblood of our trades and construction industries.”

“The money will be filtered through in the forms of a new man-made, enclosed beach in each of the nations capital cities, that will look so realistic their followers won’t be able to tell the difference.”

Morrison explained that there would also be aid in the form of providing one-off grants for the influencers to purchase new followers and the creation of thousands of new bots who will like and comments on their profiles.

Gina Phones Rupert Murdoch To Ask If Barnaby Can Have His Old Job Back Yet

TEXT:

On behalf of her close personal friend Barnaby Joyce, Gina Rinehart telephoned Rupert Murdoch this afternoon to see if he’s hugged the cactus on the backbench long enough.

Australia’s richest person is said to be working as a mediator between the two powerful men and she took the time to speak to The Advocate about what she said to both parties today.

“Rupert said he’d think about it,” said Gina to our reporter this afternoon via SnapChat.

“Which is all I asked him to do. Rupert said he thinks this election might be unsalvagable for the Coalition and it’d be best to leave McCormack to fly the plane into the mountainside in the interim,”

“But he also conceded that if they were going to win this election, they’d have a better chance with Joyce at the helm. It’s quite a conundrum.”

Our reporter also spoke to Barnaby, who said he’s just putting along a day at a time and taking his job as the New England’s voice in Canberra very seriously.

However, the Armidale local did say he’d be open to taking the Nationals leadership back if that’s what the party room wanted.

“I don’t want to speculate,” said Joyce.

“One thing I do want to mention is that I secured funding for a new bridge near Tenterfield this week. They’ll be getting their new double-carriageway bridge early next year,”

“And the drought is still ongoing – despite all this recent rain we’ve had. Still need more. Good chatting, anyway. Talk soon, BJ.”

Rupert Murdoch was approached for comment but no reply has been received at the time of print.

Desperate PM Delves Into Situational Comedy In Attempt To Win Over Jewish Voters In Wentworth

TEXT:

Despite growing up only a few kilometres away from the nation’s most iconic and historical Jewish-Australian enclave, Prime Minister Scott Morrison has once again missed the mark in his efforts to secure the Jewish vote in the upcoming Wentworth By-Election.

This follow’s his surprise announcement on Tuesday that Australia may relocate its embassy to Jerusalem. A captain’s call that appears to have divided Wentworth’s Jewish community, and a policy that the Liberal’s own candidate, and former ambassador to Israel, Dave Sharma had previously stayed well away from.

Many in the Jewish-Australian community say that, regardless of their support for the idea, it is not lost on them that such a proposal several days out from an Eastern Suburbs by-election is quite patronising – as the Liberal Party chase a sugar hit of support through knee jerk-backflips and on-the-spot policy.

However, with his balls to the wall, Morrison has returned today with a new shtick that is sure to win over the 13% of Jewish voters in the Wentworth electorate.

Situational comedy.

Because if there’s one thing Jewish people love more than being thrown into divisive barbecue conversations about Israel, it’s Jerry Seinfeld and his legacy of awkward but surprisingly layered jokes about every day life. Well, that’s according to Scott Morrison’s 24-year-old Cronulla-based media advisor

“What’s the deal with aeroplane food!?” said the Prime Minister, in a surprise set at Bondi Beach comedy club last night.

“It’s like, normal food, but smaller. It never fills you up!”

Speaking to the media today, Morrison said he feels like his set went pretty well, and he’s just relieved to have found something that he can use to appeal to Jewish people with pork barreling them.

“Uh oh…” he said.

“I mean, that’s the wrong word… Um”

The next 25 minutes of the press conference saw the Prime Minister attempt to dig his way out from the gaffe of saying ‘pork barrel’ – in a hilarious Larry David style monologue.

Pauline Hanson Tells Great Barrier Reef Its Ok To Be White

TEXT:

After being unable to convince the majority of a predominantly white upper house to vote in favour of her incendiary motion that declared, “It’s OK to be white.” – Pauline Hanson has now turned her attention to the sickly Great Barrier Reef.

The One Nation Senator has since flown to the Great Barrier Reef to discuss anti-white prejudice with the world’s biggest natural organism.

“If I can’t convince Australians it’s ok, if not better, to be white, at least I’ll know you guys will listen. In fact, you’ve got no choice [haha]” she said to some rotting coral just south of Lizard Island.

Senator Hanson’s motion condemning so-called “anti-white racism” was defeated in the Senate on Monday, but was backed by 23 Coalition senators and strongly endorsed on Twitter afterwards by cabinet ministers.

The phrase “it’s OK to be white” is widely associated with alt-right, white supremacist and neo-Nazi movements, particularly in the US.

But now, after failing to convince people that it’s ok to be white, the Queensland Senator has turned her attention to the environment, and more specifically the embattled Great Barrier Reef, which is currently in a critical state after two catastrophic bleaching episodes as a result of climate change and mining spill off.

“Everyone’s telling you that you should be ashamed of your white features.” she whispered to the millennia-old natural wonder of the world.

“Don’t listen to them. It’s beautiful. If holidays want to stop coming here to prop up a multi-billion dollar tourism, then that’s there fault”

“They can be replaced with coal mining and other industries that are supportive of white coral”

“It’s okay to be white. It’s beautiful. It’s a shame we can’t bleach the migrants as well”

National Party’s Alt-Right Infiltrators Resign After Being Forced To Match Barnaby Beer For Beer

TEXT:

NSW Nationals MP Troy Grant has come out saying his party was not a “safe harbour for people with outrageous views”, responding to revelations that alt-right nationalists have been attempting to stack the NSW Young Nationals.

Ironically, while the organisation is mostly made up of young men lacking reliable father figures, the alt-right’s stance on abortion laws is surprisingly less extreme than the busted old bushies running their new party.

The Nationals have revealed they will temporarily suspended processing new NSW Young Nationals memberships, after the revelations

At least three NSW Young Nationals, are, or recently have been, members of a group called the Lads Society, a new project headed by some of the nation’s most prominent alt-right nationalists like Blair Cottrell.

However, the Betoota Advocate can reveal that since this announcement, the rebel infiltrators have already resigned.

This comes after being forced to spend an evening with former Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce.

One at-risk latent homosexual ex-private schooler who walked in on his valium addled mum having sex with a pool cleaner before his preparatory violin recital Wyatt Privolic (27), says although he has spent his whole life craving the attention of a father figure, Barnaby Joyce was just too much.

“He just kept making me drink” says the Eastern Suburbs born and raised son of a hedge fund manager, who fears Muslims and feminists despite never meeting a Muslim and never really meeting a feminist.

“It wasn’t even fun in the end. It was just excessive”

“What’s wrong with these drunk old bushies. They are just loud idiots who yarn about grain storage and water policies.”

“Whatever happened to the real, nostalgic Australia that I misplaced during my underwhelming childhood”

“Whatever happened to making life hard for migrants and Aboriginal people for the sheer jolt of sexual gratification? All these blokes talk about is regional football results and cattle prices”

Labor Vows To Strip Religious Schools Of The Freedoms Labor Gave Them To Sack Gay Staff

TEXT:

Following the news that Prime Minister Morrison will be changing the law to ban religious educational organisations from the right to expel gay students, the ALP has take the opportunity to say that they too will do something even more progressive.

By banning these same organisations from having the right to sack gay staff, a still-standing religious freedom that was afforded to them by Julia Gillard, the second most recent ALP leader, which, funnily enough was only in power like six years and three Prime Ministers ago.

During her stint as Prime Minister, Julia Gillard assured religious groups they would have the ”freedom”  to discriminate against homosexuals and others they deem sinners, under a rights bill her government put forward.

Under current law, which was kept completely in tact by three consecutive Labor governments, faith-based organisations, including schools and hospitals, can refuse to hire those they view as sinners if they consider it ”is necessary to avoid injury to the religious sensitivities of adherents of that religion”.

“We vow to change these horrible laws that we staunchly supported in 2013” said Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, in a press conference today.

“Shame on the coalition government for not doing more to change these laws we created”

Parliament Thrown Into Chaos As Derryn Hinch Does Something Reasonable

TEXT:

The Parliament of Australia was thrown into utter chaos this week as single-issue senator Derryn Hinch awoke from his slumber and shocked everyone by doing something reasonable.

Following the announcement of his plans to cut funding to private schools that discriminate against gay students, many senators were horrified to learn they agreed with him causing Penny Wong to vomit and Richard Di Natale to hide beneath his seat crying and screaming with his fingers in his ears.

“I just think private schools should have their funding stripped if they exercise their right to discriminate against gay students,” stated the Senator as if talking sense is something he does on a daily basis.

“Now can we get back to reforming the justice system?”

Outside of the upper house, many members of the Australian public are having a hard time dealing with the fact that they have agreed with a statement made by a man who has been to prison twice and has pretty much only ever spoken about developing a sex offender register more complex than the entire Australian Tax Office.

Australians say that were also left feeling confused after agreeing with Andrew Bolt on this same issue.

Environment Minister Who Used To Work In Mining Sector Bit Skeptical Of 91 Different Scientists

TEXT:

Federal Environment Minister Melissa Price has put some of her extensive scientific knowledge to good use today by calling bullshit on the recent report released by the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

The report claims that world greenhouse gas emissions must reach zero by 2050 if we are to ensure that Global Warming is halted at 1.5 degrees. If this wasn’t to happen the planet could warm by 2 degrees which would be a “tipping point.”

The forming mining sector employee argued this morning that some of the world’s leading climate scientists are “drawing a long bow” in calling for an end to coal power to limit global warming.

After graduating as a lawyer, Price spent nearly 20 years working in the mining sector across a variety of commercial and legal roles before moving into politics.

Price told The Advocate today that this background has been invaluable, and taught her more about climate science than any of these ‘scientists’ who have spent their entire careers in the field.

“These 91 scientists behind the report got it wrong,” she said.

“They clearly don’t understand that Australia is coal country. And that means that coal can’t be contributing to climate change. It’s simple when you think about it really. I’m not sure why we spend so much times on these things.”

Price then explained to us that it confuses her and a lot of her colleagues why these scientists who have no ulterior motives or political agendas would continually keep trying to damage coal’s brand.

“It’s like a big clean energy conspiracy,” she said.

“And the world is not going to warm beyond repair, that’s all rubbish. And even if it is true, it’s not worth paying an extra few hundred dollars a year per home to ensure that the world is not sent towards environmental ruin. Not on my watch anyway.”

“Besides, if we were to stop using coal, how would I land a plum job after my political career spruiking the interests of the mining industry.”

Uncle Tony X Hosts Liberal Party Pop-Up In Culture Kings

TEXT:

The Special Envoy to Indigenous Affairs has today taken an unorthodox route towards swaying voters, after hosting an in-store signing and merch pop-up event in the Warringah Culture Kings store.

The Former Prime Minister has reportedly become a repeat customer at the iconic Australian streetwear franchise, after his new Tongan-Australian girlfriend took him there to pick up some Chicago Bulls kit over the weekend.

This marks and concerted effort to appeal to more a multicultural spread of Australian voters, which is a first for Uncle Tony X, or as he is now known by his Tongan in-laws Uncle Tane X.

Liberal Party colleagues, while incredibly uncomfortable surrounded by that many black people wearing hoods, say that it shows a new direction for the Liberal Party – who up until now was planning on offering discounts on Coopers Pale Ale and RM Williams boots in an effort to drive up membership numbers.

Today’s meet-and-greet comes after a whirlwind fortnight that has seen the Member for Warringah enter the NSW prison system and convert to Islam, and hook up with Tongan cutie from Griffith, ever since he gave a conditional yes to taking on the job of the Federal Government’s Indigenous envoy.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison did not ask Uncle Tony to be a minister in his new Government, but instead asked him to take on the role of envoy, citing his close association with Aboriginal Australia after growing up in a six bedroom mansion in Sydney’s Northern Beaches and working for the Liberal Party for nearly three decades.

However, it appears that Uncle Tony has decided to embrace the new non-cabinet pity role, after today’s succesful in-store Liberal Party rally.

At time of press Uncle Tane X was seen singing an acoustic version of How Deep Is Your Love, by New Zealand rnb/soul band Adeaze.

Morrison Turns Sickly Grey After A Dementor’s Kiss From He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Prime-Minister

TEXT:

Prime Minister Morrison has experienced the horrid feeling of his soul being consumed upon, after shaking hands with a gliding, wraith-like dark creature once employed by the Australian Ministry of Immigration as the guard of Nauru Prison.

The Minister, who originates from the Division of Dickson, was in the role of Dementor for the Ministry of Immigration from 21 December 2014 until like a week ago, in which time his defection to the Dark Lord’s cause became undeniable.

Following the news last month that Peter Dutton MP had divided his soul in to seven horcruxes ahead of a possible coalition leadership spill, spurred on by NewsLimited, it seems even the Australian Prime Minister is vulnerable to the Dementor’s Kiss.

The Dementor’s Kiss is the act of a Dementor sucking out a person’s soul. It was sometimes used as a sentence for criminals by the Ministry of Immigration, and is considered a fate worse than death.

Prime Minister Morrison, who himself has dabbled as a dementor in the past, was noticeably rattled as Dutton began feeding off his soul in a way that is usually reserved for illegal immigrants and asylum seekers who find themselves within the walls of Nauru.

“He was aware that his soul was being torn from him the moment he touched the Dementor’s hand” said one aide.

“He was quick to wrap up the handshake before he ended up in a vegetative state”

“He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Prime-Minister [Dutton] must be still spewing about missing out on the top job, after fucking up the libspill numbers. He’s not very bright”

“Still, he knows how to run a tidy offshore Azkaban”

As described in popular anglo-saxon folklore, Dementors feed upon human happiness, and thus cause depression and despair to anyone near them. They can also consume a person’s soul, leaving their victims in a permanent vegetative state and thus are often referred to as “soul-sucking fiends“.

They are known to leave a person as an ’empty-shell’ which can sometimes result in self-immolation.

As was discovered underneath the Rudd Ministry, Dementors hold no true loyalty, except to whomever can provide them with the most people to feed off.

Peter Dutton has responded to the allegations that he was attempting a ‘Dementor’s Kiss’ on the Governer-General. He says it is so typical of the lefty media to use the handshake as an opportunity to push their pro-LGBTI, anti-self-immolation agenda.

“Wtf is a Demetors kiss?” he posted to twitter.

“Sounds gay as”

Girlfriend Didn’t Ask For Cooper Cronk’s Life Story

“Yeah, so last year they thought he was gonna be injured, but it turns out he was alright to play,” said Kel (26).

That was pretty much all he needed to say, but after observing the refreshing look of interest in his girlfriend’s eyes, Kel decided to run her through his entire career. Starting from his early years playing rugby union in Brisbane’s Catholic School comp, right through the eight-in-a-row Origin streak, countless Melbourne Storm premierships, the salary cap scandal and of course his most recent club-swap to the Sydney Roosters.

“Oh true” says Sarah, the long-suffering girlfriend of a Fantasy NRL addict, and Victorian ex-pat, who is only asking light questions to kill time until she can go home and watch UnReal on Netflix.

Kel, who’s so infatuated with the match ahead of him that he fails to read past his misso’s feigned interest, continues.

“Yeah, actually, so like, there’s been a bit of legacy in Melbourne over the last decade. The big three they used to call them. Billy Slater, Cameron Smith, Cooper Cronk. Pretty much the greatest players of the modern era in their respective positions, so like, for him to leave for the Roosters was a pretty big call, like everyone thought they were going to retire together.”

“They’ve turned on the fucking government, which by my fucking understanding means they’re fucking done for,”

Another reporter, this time from Fairfax, asked Shorten about the ongoing crisis at the ABC.

“It’s not a good look, is it?” he said.

Leigh Sales And Andrew Bolt Hold Hands In Protest Of Justin Milne’s Political Interference

TEXT:

Two of the nation’s most prominent journalists have put their differences aside today in a touching display of unity against embattled ABC chairman Justin Milne.

Earlier today, a number of leaked emails were published by the failing newspaper branch of Nine Entertainment Co, Fairfax Media, that detailed Mr Milne’s attempts to have the ABC’s chief economic correspondent, Emma Albanichi, sacked for her interpretation of a federal budget.

“That’s not on!” said the Aunty’s Leigh Sales and Fox News’s Andrew Bolt in near unison.

They both laughed earnestly at each other. Leigh called ‘jinx’ and Andrew sighed playfully.

“Any political interference in the ABC is abhorrent and disgusting,” said Bolt.

“Yeah! So what if Emma thought the last budget was just a thinly-veiled neo-Reganist throwback to the good old days where the rich get richer and the poor eat shit and die? That’s just, like, her opinion, man!” added Leigh.

“Anyway, there must’ve been a full moon or something last night because here I am today arm in arm was Leigh Sales on the ground floor of the Ultimo Kremlin in Sydney’s hellish inner-city calling for the ABC Chairman to be sacked. Who would’ve thought?” said Bolt.

“Tell me about it!” replied Sales.

The pair then joined other ABC workers out the front on Harris Street with members of News Corp, Fairfax and Nine to burn a number of effigies of Justin Milne.

This rare showing of harmony between two media identities who clearly don’t see eye to eye on almost everything while still harbouring a respectful disdain for one another has left the nation reeling.

Locally, some members of the Betoota community said they felt uncomfortable looking at pictures of them holding hands in protest.

“This country is going to hell,” said one.

“Maybe they should just privatise the ABC and move it to Ryde? Let it burn?” said another.

“I’m glad my tax dollars are being put to good use this week! We need to drain the ABC swamp right now!”

Uncle Tony X Licks His Lips While Watching Cafe Staff Prepare Him A Devon And Chip Sandwich

Former Prime Minister Uncle Tony X has today admitted to having a few secret vices when it comes to mission cuisine, after revealing he’s managed to get a local Canberra cafe to add devon and chip sandwiches to the menu.

Uncle Tony says he’s well aware that he might not be setting a very good example, especially when considering the statistics that suggest majority of Australia’s Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population don’t have access to fresh fruit and vegetables, but the old ‘Murgon Works Burger’ is something he just can’t quit.

“Eyaa don’t skimp on the salt my deadly brother” said the Former Prime Minister.

Uncle Tony X says the devon and chip sambo is one of the few constants in his life, after a whirlwind fortnight that has seen the Member for Warringah enter the NSW prison system and convert to Islam, since he gave a conditional yes to taking on the job of the Federal Government’s Indigenous envoy.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison did not ask Mr Abbott to be a minister in his new Government, but instead asked him to take on the role of envoy, citing his close association with Aboriginal Australia after growing up in a six bedroom mansion in Sydney’s Northern Beaches and working for the Liberal Party for nearly three decades.

Singer-songwriter Kev Carmody has penned a protest song this week calling for the release of Uncle Tony X – the Prime Minister’s special envoy on Indigenous Affairs.

Last weekend, the prominent Northern Beaches elder was thrown in gaol after failing to get a taxi home after the South Sydney Rabbitohs historic win against the St George Illawarra Dragons.

Since then, the activist has since converted to Islam and has had a few run-ins with a couple jailhouse skinheads.

He’s since been held without charge at Sydney’s Silverwater Correctional Facility Remand Centre where he awaits a hearing.

Rumours have swirled today that Uncle Tony might get day release tomorrow to take part in this weekend’s Koori Knockout tournament in Dubbo.

Until then, he sits in prison – which is something Carmody wanted to highlight.

The Ballard of Uncle Tony X chronicles the life and times of Uncle Tony, who’s experienced an untold personal struggle since becoming the special envoy on Indigenous Affairs.

Carmody took to social media today to release the song, calling on the powers that be to release him and let justice prevail.

“It’s Ok To Be White,” Says The Main Culprit For White People Having A Bad Name

TEXT:

With Parliament breaking again for another month, Pauline Hanson tried her hardest today to grab a few headlines.

The former fish and chip operator from Ipswich put forward a motion in the Senate today, to try and alleviate the suffering of the nation’s Caucasians.

The motion asked the Senate to acknowledge:

The deplorable rise of anti-white racism and attacks on western civilisation

It’s okay to be white

Tragically the Senate was short on time and will have to look at Hanson’s motion next month, which borrows the phrase ‘It’s Okay To Be White’ from prominent Canadian fame hunter and attention seeker Lauren Southern.

Hanson, one of the main reasons for white people having a bad name in recent times, along with the legacy and in some cases the continued systematic oppression of many non-white races for much of recorded history, explained that the Caucasian race needs to stand and be proud of itself.

“If we leave the left to continue pushing their cultural marxism down our throats, this great nation will completely disintegrate,” Hanson said.

She then asked our reporters if they could explain to her what cultural Marxism meant, stating that she kept hearing it used on Facebook and in the Courier Mail but wasn’t actually sure what it was.

After our reporters explained the term to her she then continued on with some shit about anti-white racism.

“This continued acknowledgement by people that white Australians generally don’t have it so bad compared to some groups of migrants and Indigenous Australians will open the floodgates,” she said.

“Enough is enough! We need to be loud and to be proud. It’s okay to be white,” she said, as if anyone has actually been systematically discriminated against for being white.

“Did they do the what’s this then slut thing?” asked incarcerated Special Envoy to Indigenous Affairs.

“Or that one about the migaloo who talks like she’s mob. That’s a crack up”

However, Uncle Tony’s last remaining ally in the Coalition Government, his brother cousin BJ, was unable to to give a clear and thorough run-down on last night’s programme, as he was too busy laughing at the Bondi Blackfella skit.

“Aye hurry up. I only get a five minutes fuck ya”

“What’s the skit about? I hearded Goodesy was on there. The screws won’t let me watch telly after my run in with those gammin skinheads yesterday”

It is believed after trying unsuccessfully to get Barnaby Joyce to settle down, the conversation quickly turned to a discussion about whether or not Scott Morrison was ridiculing them by giving them special envoy positions that meant they would have to spend less time in Canberra and more time in remote communities away from the media.

Uncle Tony Arrested For Jaywalking After Being Unable To Hail A Cab Home From The Footy

TEXT:

After rapidly embracing a new model of staunch Indigenous activism, Uncle Tony Abbott has this weekend experienced the same discrimination faced by many of his black constituents.

The newly-appointed Special Envoy to Indigenous Affairs says he was arrested for no good reason while walking home from the South Sydney Rabbitohs semi-finals clash against the St George Illawarra Dragons.

Using his one phone call from the watch house this morning, Uncle Tony Abbott explained to our reporters that he was unable to hail a cab from outside the Sydney Olympic Stadium last night, and was forced to make his 32 kilometre journey home to Manly on foot.

Despite only having two and a half Premium Light shandies, the Special Envoy to Indigenous Affairs was not able to get a taxi driver to stop for him, even when their overhead lights were switched on.

“Three guesses as to why that was happening” stated a sullen Uncle Tony.

“I can stop the boats but I can’t stop a cab.”

According to the Member for Warringah, he briefly considered the idea of taking public transport but opted not to, remembering an incident when he was racially abused by drunk racegoers last weekend.

“Next thing I know the bullyman is there with the blue and reds. I was just trying to get home, fuck ya” said Uncle Tony X.

The NSW Police Force stand behind their decision to stop the high-profile Northern Beaches elder for jaywalking, referring to the state’s traffic infringement laws.

Upon handing over his ID and and having it run through the system, police then decided to incarcerate the Special Envoy to Indigenous Affairs, after discovering a log of unpaid parking fines.

The officers behind the arrest say they are unable to explain the bruising on Uncle Tony’s face and refuse to comment on his suspected internal injuries this morning.

It is believed that Uncle Tony will remain in police custody until the Aboriginal Legal Service sends a dreadlocked 23-year-old volunteer to represent him against these charges.

ScoMo Excuses Himself From Press Conference To Field Important Phone Call From The Boss

TEXT:

Just minutes after stepping out for lunch today, the Prime Minister held a press conference to throw a wet blanket over his predecessor’s calls to have Peter Dutton’s eligibility to sit in the House decided by the High Court.

However, just as Scott Morrison was about to answer a very difficult question, his phone rang.

He looked down at it and immediately excused himself, saying it was a call he wasn’t in the position to ignore.

Sources close to the Prime Minister have said the call came from his immediate superior, Rupert Murdoch.

Earlier today, the Prime Minister was forced to make a call on Peter Dutton’s future – so he naturally rang Rupert to get some feedback before he made his mind up.

However, the effervescent billionaire was engaged in other business at the time and was simply returning the phone call.

It would seem that during the phone call, the tyrannical South Australian instructed Morrison not to defer Peter Dutton to the High Court.

The Prime Minister spoke to Mr Murdoch for a few minutes before he sheepishly apologised and returned to the waiting pack of journalists.

“Sorry, that was the boss,” he fatherly laughed.

“And I’m not talking about Bruce Springsteen!”

The nation collectively groaned at the dad joke and forgot about how shockingly corrupt federal politics is for another day.

Former Deputy Prime Minister and the current Member for Grayndler, Anthony Albanese MP has today fronted the media after some onkgray scuffed his new cream coloured Nike TNs at a music event in Sydney’s outer inner west.

The Shadow Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Cities and Regional Development, says he knew exactly what had happened when some no hoper stood on the front of his shoes while watching a Sydney hip hop act an all-ages club night in Hurstville over the weekend.

“I’m so off it” Albanese told reporters.

“These Leftie Elites Are Out Of Touch With Voters” Says Man Whose Mates All Have Au Pairs

TEXT:

Peter Dutton has slammed the powerful media figures today after the au pair scandal rages on.

The aspirational Home Affairs Minister, who confirmed to us today that he is wishing things were still the way they were before he shat the bed in a leadership challenge, has once again hit out at what he calls the ‘media elites’ – who are out of touch with everyday Australians.

After another week of headlines, the ex-Queensland Cop is under fire from all corners over his pulling of strings to allow his mates to skirt immigration laws.

However, despite earning his stripes on 2GB and News Corp platforms as an immigration hardman, Dutton is now in a bit of curry for calling in favours for mates and powerful people who knew he was easily impressionable and desperate to have friends as bougie as Turnbull’s friends.

Dutton has explained that to us today that the whole thing is a campaign by media elites to tarnish his reputation, and criticised these so-called elites despite numerous attempts to bring in people who are the very epitome of the silver spoon.

“This whole campaign against me is bullshit. A hard done by Argentine Polo player and some run of the mill persecuted young European women seem to be too much for these elitist toffs to handle,” Dutton said.

“I’m just a battler trying to help other battlers out, and these left-wing media types in their ivory towers hate it!”

Uncle Tony Abbott Accused Been Spoiling The Jarjums Silly

TEXT:

Former Prime Minister Tony Abbott has today admitted to possibly having a rubber arm when it comes to treating his nephew and nieces.

“They know I just crumble when they hit me up for some choccies or some toys” said Mr Abbott.

“I know I gotta be firmer, but hey if you can’t treat your own mob then who can ya treat”

Tony Abbott says his reluctance to discipline his younger relatives comes from the fact that he can’t bring himself to punish Indigenous kids anymore than they already are, given the record-breaking incarceration rates.

In 2015-16, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children were 25 times more likely to be in detention and 17 times more likely to be under some form of youth justice order than non-Indigenous children, up from 21 times more likely to be in detention and 13 times more likely to be in some kind of care in 2011-12. As of 2018, 100% of all juvenile detention inmates were Indigenous.

The accusations of being Uncle Tony being too soft on the kids comes after the Member for Warringah gave a conditional yes to taking on the job of the Federal Government’s Indigenous envoy.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison did not ask Mr Abbott to be a minister in his new Government, but instead asked him to take on the role of envoy, citing his close association with Aboriginal Australia after growing up in a six bedroom mansion in Sydney’s Northern Beaches and working for the Liberal Party for nearly three decades.

Earlier last week and before any of the details of the job had become public, Mr Abbott appeared reluctant, saying he needed to know the precise terms of what was being proposed.

However, it appears that Abbott has decided to embrace the new non-cabinet pity role, and says he’s alway been the go-to man for the jarjums, who know he’s a big softie deep down.

Liberal Party Asks Their Disgruntled Female MPs If It’s That Time Of The Month Or Something

TEXT:

Following the resignation of marginal seat winning Victorian MP Julia Banks, The Federal Government has today had to look subjectively at their treatment of women within their own party.

Ms Banks announced on Wednesday she would quit Parliament at the election, citing “intimidation”, “bullying” and “bad behaviour” by colleagues who rallied the numbers to oust Malcolm Turnbull as prime minister.

Other members of the Liberal Party have spoken out last week about being targeted by conservatives looking to push the party further to the right, and attempting to blackmail their female colleagues into doing what they want them to do.

Senior Liberal women — including Ms Banks — have also spoken before about the party’s gender problem, and how a lack of representation affects its image with voters.

In a 15-year low, just 18 of the 84 Liberal MPs and senators in Parliament are women, and the ones that are there are often threatened to lose their pre-selection unless they do what they are told by the far-right conservatives within the party.

The issue has been in the spotlight this year with Jane Prentice losing the preselection in her Queensland seat and NSW MP Ann Sudmalis also under threat.

However, the Liberal Party has today released a statement suggesting the issues that their female MPs have with the inner workings of the organisation might actually have more to do with their own hormones.

“I mean, you need to ask, is it that time of the month, love?” said an anonymous backbencher for an affluent coastal electorate North of Sydney.

“Their concerns could be very real. But then again, they could just be related to menstruation. It’s can be quite a professional ailment”

“Maybe they’ve all synced up at the same time. I’ve heard that can happen”

ScoMo Ashamedly Admits He Isn’t ‘Turnbull Rich’ When Asked If He’ll Forgo The Salary

TEXT:

The nation’s newest Prime Minister Scott Morrison was forced to concede today.

Fielding questions about his newfound role, the rich white man from Sydney had to admit that, while he is rich, he isn’t ‘Turnbull rich.’

The admission came after we questioned the man being dubbed ScoMo, about whether he would be pulling ‘a Turnbull’ and donating his salary, rather than pocketing it, like all of the other nation’s high paid public servants.

Turnbull, made seemingly few headlines when he announced that he would be donating his Parliamentary salary to charity, in a show of his intentions in terms of the role.

However, ScoMo told us that while he is reasonably well off, he doesn’t think he is well off enough to be running the country pro bono.

“Good on Malcolm you know, but it’s a different kettle of fish for me.”

“Malcolm was a merchant banker, a high flying barrister and a well regarded legal counsel. He is worth a lot of money. He is elite level rich,” Morrison said.

The former Immigration Minister explained to us that while he grew up in the well-to-do electorate of Wentworth, and has been a bureaucrat his whole life, he doesn’t consider himself on that level.

“I’m just public servant rich, which is certainly not rich enough to be turning your nose up at half a mill,” Morrison said.

“In my mind anyway.”

ScoMo Hands Dutton Cabinet Position In Order To Ensure Government Doesn’t Run Smoothly

TEXT:

In today’s announcement of the latest edition of Australia’s cabinet, Peter Dutton was once again given a place amongst Australia’s most influential public servants.

“I thought I’d test myself as a leader,” Scott Morrison said in a statement today.

“In my first real act as Prime Minister, I have made absolutely sure that the instability of our government is not compromised, and that the least qualified people within the party room are given the jobs with the most responsibility. It is now my job to try and unify them.”

When asked specifically about Dutton’s reappointment as Home Affairs minister, Mr Morrison said: “We needed the people with the least ability to competently complete any type of important task. When Dutton’s leadership challenge last week failed as spectacularly as Mal Meninga’s political career, I knew I had the right man for the job.”

“Don’t worry. I’m already planning how to make the Liberals lose this election in spite of Morrison.”

However, due to Mr Dutton’s uncanny ability to fuck up his seemingly unlosable endeavours, it is believed that he may single-handedly win the next election for the Liberals.

He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named Retreats Back Into The Darkness After Defeat

TEXT:

The aspirational former Home Affairs Minister has retreated back into the shadows of the Liberal Party after a crushing defeat yesterday.

The ex Queensland cop is licking his wounds after a demoralising loss in yesterday’s leadership spill.

The Dark Lord of Nauru had the top job pinched from under his nose by the Scott Morrison after many long months of hard work destabilising the party he is supposed to serve.

The Betoota Advocate can confirm that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named has shrunk back into the darkest depths of the Liberal Party to plot what will most likely be another assault with his boss Tony Abbott.

With little to no regard for the people who elected him to the parliament, or the people of Australia generally, the man who walked out on the nation’s apology to The Stolen Generations is trying to figure out where to from here.

After tirelessly pushing for a Home Affairs Ministry, the most powerful Ministry created in the history of this country, the ex-Copper threw it all away for a chance to have a run at the top gig.

With Sco-Mo and his allies promising not to reward the behaviour of the Dark Lord, Abbott and their friends, it remains to be seen whether he will be able to get back into a position where he can deny asylum-seeking children urgent medical attention again.

Go Home Cunt, Says Nation

The nation of Australia has extended a polite request to the Former Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton today.

Australia as a collective country has asked the highway cop from the Sunshine Coast to ‘please, go home, cunt.’

The request comes after Peter Dutton, and his conservative backbench allies and media backers have held the country to ransom over the last fortnight, in a vain attempt to “regain control” of the Liberal Party of Australia.

After destabilising the Coalition Government for months, Dutton looked crushed this afternoon after realising he isn’t very good at counting and had to come to terms with losing the leadership ballot.

Scott Morrison won the leadership ballot 45-40 against Dutton, with Josh Frydneberg taking the reigns as Deputy Prime Minister after edging out Greg Hunt.

After it was announced that Scott Morrison will be the next Prime Minister of Australia, it was confirmed that Peter Dutton, the man who walked out on the National Apology to the Stolen Generations, should just head back to the Sunshine Coast and look out for people changing lanes without an indicator.

Whether, Dutton, the man who refused to bring asylum-seeking children needing urgent medical attention to Australia, will in fact just go home remains to be seen.

After another morning of headlines and speculation about who will be the country’s Prime Minister at the end of the day, the nation of Australia has asked if our politicians could do some actual work.

The calls come after Peter Dutton came out this morning to request another leadership spill, one which Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has so far denied.

The nation, however, is now wondering if the schoolyard games could be put aside by our elected representatives on $200,000+ salaries in order to attempt to do some of the stuff they were elected to do.

The Advocate can reveal that it has been informed by a number of sources that the Coalition MP’s have no real interest in doing actual work for the near future.

WIth parliament about to break for two weeks, the nation has been informed that the coalition politicians don’t intend to spend their last day doing anything other than playing petty mind games about whose team should win at the national expense.

The revelations come as huge numbers of Libs and Nats run between each other’s offices gossiping about whose side they are on today and who they are going to vote for in the next spill.

Kevin Hogan the National MP from the Northern Rivers of NSW has confirmed that he will be leaving the coalition and sitting on the crossbench if there is another leadership spill told us on the record that he seems to be the only one that’s had enough.

Thumbtack On Sole Of Shoe Offers Local Man A Rare Glimpse Into Life Of A Tap Dancer

TEXT:

HR manager Cindy Belengoff (30) had a fleeting trip into the world of ‘what-if’ today as a thumbtack on the sole of her shoe provided her with a rare glimpse into the life of a tap dancer.

On her lunch break, Belengoff was heading to her usual cafe to order her usual no flavour, low-calorie chicken wrap, when she became aware of a metallic clicking sound emanating from her right foot as she walked.

Stopping to observe the cause of the noise, Belengoff was privately delighted to see a single gold thumbtack was stuck to the sole of her shoe, clicking it against the ground to achieve the desired effect synonymous with tap dancing.

“Cool,” Belengoff stated as she tapped her way to a zestier lunch destination.

“Sort of like being a tap dancer isn’t it?”

Tuning into some Michael Buble, Belengoff tapped her way through the Betoota Central Business District, making the occasional flourish as she stopped at a crossing and dodging a street pest with a stunning pirouette.

“Wow. Makes me wonder if I shouldn’t have given it a go.”

As Belengoff tapped carefree through the streets she was catcalled by an unknown man on a smoke break.

Usually, one to privately seeth about catcalls, Belengoff tapped her invigorated feet over to the man and kissed him passionately before stealing his cigarette and messing up his hair, leaving him confused and aroused as she tapped away.

During this time period, a woman matching Belengoff’s description allegedly entered a Betoota fine dining restaurant, ordered a rare rib eye and left without paying. Front of house staff report hearing a clicking sound as the unknown woman fled the scene.

Belengoff is unable to say where she was during the time the steak was stolen but assured reporters she returned to her workplace at 1:32 pm, after removing the thumbtack from her shoe and tossing it onto the street, ready to give another unsuspecting drone a peek into the mysterious life of a tap dancer.

Shorten Becomes ‘Flat Earther’ In Order To Build Credibility

TEXT:

In what some are calling the most desperate move in politics since Harold Holt tried to win the surfie vote, opposition leader Bill Shorten has announced he is now a ‘Flat-Earther’ in an unprecedented move to build his own credibility.

Flat-Earthers are a fringe group of people who in the face of hundreds of years of scientific evidence believe the earth is not a spheroid shape that it actually is, but rather a flat map-like shape floating around in the universe like Rolf Harris’ limp, impotent wobble board.

Shorten is the latest household name to come out publicly as a Flat-Earther alongside basketball player Kyrie Irving and rapper B.o.B. who are rich enough that it

“I guess me and Karierie Irvin [sic] have another thing in common now,” said Shorten, grinning as he tried to spin a basketball on his index finger.

“I’m not one of those snow globe nut jobs though, don’t loop me in with them please.”

Knowledge about Shorten’s new credential building beliefs became known during a press conference when he was asked to give his opinion on US President Donald Trump’s new Space Force program.

“We need to protect our planet’s water resources, that manage to stay our planet because the earth is flat. If it was round the water would slip off and float away into space. If I can figure that out without a science degree you’d think those lying chumps at NASA could do the same.”

While Shorten’s comments have outraged the scientific community, the Labor party still manages to edge ahead in the two-party-preferred polls.

Turnbull Seen Cartwheeling Down Parliament Hill After Dutton Tells Him To

TEXT:

Moments after the Prime Minister and the Minister for Energy And Environment, Josh Frydenberg, hosted a press conference in Canberra this morning, Malcolm Turnbull was seen doing cartwheels down Parliament Hill while Tony Abbott and Peter Dutton looked on.

“Do a somersault this time!” yelled Dutton as a breathless Prime Minister trudged back up the hill.

Earlier this year, fencing was installed at the bottom of the hill to stop people from walking over Australia’s highest temple – but it’s still largely within view from the bottom.

“Ok. Is there anything else you want me to do?” asked Turnbull.

Abbott laughed and said no.

All of a sudden, Scott Morrison came bounding out from the fire escape door and said Barnaby had a good idea.

“Hey Malcolm!” said Morrison.

“Go down the hill in your kayak! The Nats are carrying it up the stairs now.”

The Prime Minister sighed and agreed.

“Ok.”

With a great echoing, earth-shattering clunk, the kayak appear atop Parliament Hill from the fire escape door.

Barnaby Joyce, with his tie tangling loosely around his second button, dragged it over to the edge of the hill and threw the Prime Minister’s own carbon-fibre oar at him.

“There you go, mate.”

As our nation’s leader tucked himself into the kayak and prepared himself for what could be the wildest ride of his life, he turned and looked up at the God Squad holding the country to ransom and said:

“If I do this, you’re got to let me take the party to the next election.”

In the face of what looks like a very real threat to his leadership, Malcolm Turnbull has today announced plans of removing Paris climate change targets from the National Energy Guarantee in his second policy reset in four days.

The revised scheme will not stipulate a 26 per cent cut to greenhouse gas emissions in either legislation or regulation under changes aimed at keeping nameless backbenchers happy by effectively denying the fact that humans are responsible for any form of environmental damage.

“”Those of you who are worried about the environment are just going to have to fuck up for now”

Asked whether his leadership was under threat, the Prime Minister replied: “I enjoy the confidence of the cabinet and my party room.”

When asked if he thinks that he might be compromising a bit too much to maintain his position as the most powerful man in Australia, Turnbull responded as honestly as he could.

“Grow a set, you lot”

“Don’t underestimate the erratic behaviour of backbenchers you’ve never heard of, when faced with the possibility of losing their seats due to manipulated power prices, and then being forced to find another job that pays a lot less than $150k per year without perks”

“It’s up to me to control the narrative. And I believe blaming climate scientists for power prices is the easiest option, and by far the most popular opinion in my party room”

Refugee Child Trapped On Nauru Glad Government Has Distanced Itself From Anning’s Comments

TEXT:

A pre-teen asylum seeker trapped behind bars on Nauru has applauded his new surrogate nation’s politicians this week.

9-year-old Syrian boy Asghar Al-Khatib, whose family is seeking asylum in Australia has spent majority of his formative years inside the Australian government’s Pacific Island detention centre, a semi-privatised institution that has since become the closest thing the stateless war-weary youngster has to call home.

Ashgar spoke to The Advocate about the response to comments made by Central Queensland Senator Fraser Anning in his maiden speech to the Senate.

The new Senator called for a ban on Muslim migration and borrowed a quaint little German phrase ‘the final solution” to really bring it home.

However, Al-Khatib explained that it’s good to see the rest of Australia’s elected representatives condemn the ex-One Nation senator’s prejudice comments towards middle eastern migrants.

“It’s is great to see that Australia’s parliamentarians have a strong moral compass” he said.

Al-Khatib’s family has been split up after they fled from their war-torn home country, with the boy, his sister and his mum hanging out on Nauru while his old man spends a bit of time on the now defunct Manus Island.

“I’m not sure why me and mummy and my sister Azza are locked up on here, but I’m sure there must be some reason for it,” Al-Khatib said.

“I realise that now, that despite trapping us here and punishing us for trying to escape a country destroyed by war they really are quite progressive.”

“I guess they really do care about human rights!”

Katter Staffer Wonders Why He Even Bothers Writing Notes On Bob’s Hands Anymore

TEXT:

One of Bob Katter’s key policy advisors let out a heavy sigh this afternoon as the locally-popular Queensland politician spoke to the media in Cairns regarding the comments made yesterday by his Senate leader, Fraser Anning.

Staffer Colin Overell sighed because once again, Bob didn’t read any of the notes he painstakingly wrote on the palm of each hand just moments before the press conference started.

He spoke to The Advocate in the minutes after the media scrum began to disperse.

“While we were still sitting in the Statesman, I wrote the notes on Bob’s hands and I told him how the party stood on the issue,” said Overell.

“I said we must condemn Fraser and expel him from the party. There’s simply too much at risk. Then I explained that an easy out of that line of questioning was to pull the old crocodile trick and get the country to meme about him harmlessly,”

“But all that went out the window. His media advisor had their first cigarette in five years during that press conference. Honestly,”

“But yeah, back to the notes. I don’t even know why I bother doing it anymore. By the looks of things, he doesn’t even read them – let alone take what I have to say on board. I’m not sure how we’re going to get out of this one.”

Our reporter’s conversation with Overell was abruptly interrupted by Katter himself, who allegedly snatched the phone away from his staffer to continue his tongue-lashing of the media.

“And another thing!” shouted Bob.

“Who am I speaking to here? I don’t care! You’re probably some black-puffer-vest wearing, brown-boot brigade South-East corner bedwetter who doesn’t know what in Green Jesus is going on up here in North Queensland!”

Colin could be herd trying to wrestle the phone back off Bob.

After falling from grace quite spectacularly, the former Labor Senator and powerbroker has managed to find a bit of work.

With TV appearances becoming more frequent and rumours swirling round about his own TV show in the future, the previous darling of the Labor party has now also landed a role in a major film.

“Arghh arghh arghh, the Chinese Government’s military involvement in the South China Sea is an issue that should not be the concern of anyone but the Chinese Government,” Dastyari says in one of the scenes.

“The Australian Government should not interfere in these matters. Arhoooooo,” he then says before McCarthy vehemently insults him.

Barnaby’s Mid-Life Crisis Peaks After Being Spotted Wearing Lycra In Main Street Of Tamworth

Just days after releasing his autobiographical political manifesto ‘Weatherboard and Iron’ – Former Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce is back in the headlines with gusto.

Yesterday, he was dismissing the Paris agreement as something that people in Kmart don’t care about, last night he was telling the Courier Mail that the Coalition will not win the next election without Tony Abbott was leader.

And today, photos have been released of the husky Dirranbandi boy rocking some cyclist-wear in the main street of New South Wales’ North-West Capital, Tamworth, the home of the country music.

Joyce’s recent re-emergence in the community for NAIDOC events and drought relief fundraisers had all but convinced voters in the New England that his mid-life crisis was over.

However, that theory was blown out of the water after a Tamworth resident snapped photos of the National Party stalwart wearing figure-hugging lycra in the middle of Manila Street.

“I thought, maybe it’s something his new missus has gotten him into” says one voter, Toby Archdale (55).

“You know, to keep his rig under control, but he was here by himself… Which only means he fucking road in from Armidale. That’s a hell of a nudge on a road bike”

The Honourable Bob Katter III has today arrived in Brisbane with his son, Mt Isa state Member Robbie Katter, to hold ‘passionate talks’ with the Southern Cowards that want to fiddle with the clocks.

This comes after an exclusive poll by The Courier-Mail revealed that 55 per cent of Queenslanders back a transition to daylight savings, while 41 per cent opposed it and 4 per cent were undecided.

The Katter Family, who represent one of the most powerful political dynasties in North Queensland have made it very clear over the past three decades that they sit squarely in the 41 per cent who opposed these changes.

“First you take all of our taxes to build a light rail project on the bloody Gold Coast, now you want us waking up in the dark” spat a furious Bob Katter, who has indicated that he and his constituents are willing to spill blood over this issue.

“Either we succeed and stay in the same timezone, or you can load up your pissy little police issue handguns and fight us”

The new poll suggested to two-thirds of people living in the southeast wanting to see the change introduced across Queensland. If the changes were to be implemented, clocks will be moved forward an hour in October and an hour back in April – like they do in the elitist Southern states that Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk wishes we could be more like.

“We new the bastards in Brisbane were planning something, and we knew this day would come” said Robbie Katter.

Labor Deny Accusations Made By Labor About Labor Politician

TEXT:

The federal member for the seat of Lindsay, is being investigated over allegations of harassment and bullying in her staff office, according to the Labor Party. However, the Labor Party has denied these claims.

The random MP who is apparently a frontbencher for Bill Shorten has been accused of doing heaps of shitty stuff including alleged misuse of funds and entitlements, misuse of staff, workplace bullying, intimidation, verbal abuse, spreading false rumours, and harassment.

While these accusations appear serious, the Labor Party has denied that they happened, while also suggesting that they acknowledged them months ago, and are taking them seriously, and have been for a while, just they didn’t make them public during the by-elections, but also they might not have even happened.

New allegations reported on Thursday include that money raised by New South Wales Labor was paid into this random Western Sydney politician’s personal bank account and that she inappropriately harassed a former staff member on two occasions.

The random politician, that the nation has previously never cared about, responded to the allegations on Twitter, labelling them “100 per cent false”, “completely and utterly untrue, unfair and hurtful beyond belief”.

It is not yet certain if anything ever happened, but Bill Shorten has insisted that everything is okay, just stop asking about it.

Michaelia Cash Asks Pauline For Advice On How To Turn A Toothbrush Into A Prison Shank

TEXT:

Senator Michaelia Cash has today consulted on-again, off-again frenemy Pauline Hanson for some tips on how to survive life in prison.

In yet another example of the highest powered people in this country being no more tacticle or low brow as run of the mill degenerate criminals, Senator Cash has had to today ask for some advice from the only other Senator she can think of he’s been in prison.

This follows the news that the AFP is liaising with the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions about whether charges should be laid over leaks from Federal Jobs Minister Michaelia Cash’s office about raids on the Australian Workers Union.

Some journalists were tipped off and waiting when Federal police officers raided union offices in Melbourne and Sydney last October to seize documents relating to donations made to Get Up and Labor candidates when Bill Shorten was head of the AWU.

It appears this leak may result in Michaelia Cash finally living out her dream of being in a similar scenario to the girls in Wentworth, where she can assert her alpha-status by plugging a sharpened plastic toiletry into someones lung until they stop breathing.

“It’s been a while since I was in the joint, love” said Senator Hanson.

“I’m not sure what they are using nowadays…”

“But let me suss it out. One of my guys just went in last week for raping and bashing his wife.”

“If not we can put the word out through the state governments. Plenty of good intel going in and out of Long Bay with some of those old Labor mugs”

Senator Cash initially denied her office had any involvement in the leak to the media but subsequently told a Senate committee her senior media adviser had confessed that he had tipped off the media before the raids.

He has since resigned.

Shorten Feels Confident Enough To Take Stab-Proof Vest Off After Weekend By-Elections

TEXT:

Prior to his morning jog around Lake Burley-Griffin this morning, the leader of the Opposition felt safe enough to remove the stab-proof vest he’s been wearing for the past fortnight.

In the lead up to last Saturday’s by-elections, clouds were beginning to form over Bill Shorten’s capacity to lead the Labor Party to the next election – but after retaining all four seats of the seats previously held by Labor, it seems the Victorian has all-but cemented himself as the captain.

Many analysts and political commentators agreed that the Saturday by-elections were to be a litmus test for the public’s confidence in Bill Shorten, whereby a loss of any seats could trigger a knifing event.

That lead Bill Shorten’s team to recommend he start wearing a stab-proof vest to work to prevent a stabbing should it occur in the lead-up – or after a terrible result.

“It’s quite hard to jog in,” laughed Shorten as he took the vest off this morning in Canberra.

“Honestly, I’ve got half a roll of electric tape over my nipples it chaffed that bad. But yeah, a good result for the party over the weekend. The people of Australia are beginning to cotton on that the Coalition is selling them down the river and the real people leading the nation are the Liberal god squad,”

“Going into an election either by Christmas or early next year, I reckon we’ll shit it in this time. If not, I’ll give someone else a go. But for now, I’m going to frisbee this fucking vest in the lake and get on with the job.”

The Advocate reached out to the office of Tanya Plibersek and Anthony Albanese for comment, but have yet to receive a reply.

Shorten Tells Bullied ALP Staff To Harden The Fuck Up Because He Can’t Lose Another MP

TEXT:

With pressure on Bill Shorten to sack Labor backbencher Emma Husar if bullying and harassment allegations against her are proven, the leader of the ALP has today told her alleged victims to harden the fuck up, because losing another MP would almost definitely result in him never being Prime Minister.

Former staff have accused Western Sydney MP Ms Husar of asking them to perform her personal duties while working in her electorate office and of bullying them in the workplace – and say that they reported these workplace conflicts a long time ago, probably around the time that every second Labor MP was found to be a dual-citizen.

This comes as five different electorates around the country go to the polls for by-elections, four of which have resulting from sitting Labor MPs being found to have dual-citizenship.

However, while Shorten has declared that the ALP are ‘investigating’ the allegations made against Husar, he has also asked those making these allegations to ‘please harden the fuck up’ – because the abuse they are suffering at the hands of one of his colleagues is making life hard for him.

The possibility of a 6th by-election in yet another potential swing seat means that both major parties are effectively running a full-blown election campaign a whole year before a full-blown election.

“Please, I ask these victims, who we haven’t even clarified actually are victims, to harden the fuck up”

“Please. Your claims of emotional and psychological abuse are not high enough up on the totem pole to force me into even more of a vulnerable position”

“Please, I’ll follow up later, if we get elected”

“Cheers”

Turnbull Gets Back At Abbott The Only Way He Can By Getting The Pope Involved

TEXT:

Aside from putting on a united front in the lead up to the Super Saturday by-elections later this month, Malcolm Turnbull has hit back at Tony Abbott the only way he can – by getting Jesus involved.

Earlier today, the Prime Minister called on the pope to sack disgraced Adelaide archbishop Philip Wilson after he was found guilty of protecting child abusers.

The festering bag of human shit refused to step down from his position until all avenues of appeal have been exhausted.

Declining to elaborate on his comments, the PM told The Advocate that he hopes the pope does the right thing by the victims.

“It’s the least God’s representative on this hellscape we call Earth can do,” he said.

“That’s all I’m going to say on that. Thank you.”

However, many in Canberra see the Prime Minister’s comments as a direct barb to the man he deposed as leader back in 2015.

One person qualified to speak on the conflict between the two men is Barnaby Joyce.

He took time out of his busy afternoon of chopping firewood and smoking to tell The Advocate first to go fuck themselves – but later relented and said he’d glad both of them are squirming.

“I couldn’t give two fucks,” he said.

“About those two or your newspaper. Actually, delete my number, you pack of bastards.”

Joyce then let out a long sigh.

“But it’s nice to see them both so uncomfortable. Anyway, I’ve got things to do. Never call me again, cheers.”

Our reporter reached out to Tony Abbott’s office for comment but each call went through to message bank.

Australian Tax Office Has Funding Slashed After Having The Nerve To Audit An MP

TEXT:

The nation’s least favourite government agency is set to have their funding almost halved after an Australian Tax Office employee had the ‘intestinal fortitude’ to order an audit on a sitting Member of Parliament.

No media outlet is able to name the Member currently under investigation by the Tax Office because of legal reasons – however – The Advocate can reveal that the staffer at the ATO who ordered the audit is set to lose their job.

A statement released by the Office of the Treasurer this afternoon detailed the desperate necessity to ‘streamline’ and ‘restructure’ the Tax Office as to return the nation’s bottom line to the black.

“Like the ABC, the Tax Office is full of driftwood and left-leaning rot. Just the operations alone cost millions of dollars a year more than it needs to,”

“Every now and then, every company needs to trim the excess to keep shareholders happy. The government is the same. But every Australian is a shareholder in the government and the interests of every Australian is in our heart going forward when we make decisions such as this,”

“Purple monkey dishwasher.”

Just before signing off for the week, the Prime Minister explained to reporters huddled over a bin fire in a Manuka park that the cuts had nothing to do with any MP being audited.

“I’ve been audited many times,” said Malcolm Turnbull.

“There’s cheques and balances that need to be done. I expect all of you reporting on this to be audited next year. It’s just a part of the job of being an Australian tax payer,”

Turnbull then told a very cold and shivering Joe Hilderbrand to wake up to himself before getting back into the Prime Ministerial 7-Series.

Prime Minister Makes Double Sure Not To Mix Up His Australian And Panamanian Tax Returns

TEXT:

The Prime Minister has reportedly looked over his two tax returns this year, one for Panama and one for Australia, and made double sure he didn’t lodge the wrong one here.

After being named in the so-called Paradise Papers last year, Malcolm Turnbull explained to The Advocate via an encrypted end-to-end messenger service that he needs to take extra special care this year as to not have a repeat of last July.

“It’s great people in this country have such short memories,” he said.

“Now we can focus on winning on the 28th. This will be a real litmus test for the nation’s political climate right now. I reckon we’ll shit it in, personally, but yeah. I’ve been wrong before and Christ knows I’ll probably be wrong again in the future,”

“But looking forward, I think these byelections will be good for us. Anyway, I just wanted to make double sure I was lodging the right tax return with the right country. I reckon another scandal like this would just about do us.”

The Advocate also reached out to the leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, who said he didn’t really understand the Paradise Papers in the first place – he just knows they’re bad.

The privately-educated union heavy told The Advocate today that he feels the immortal quote by Kerry Packer, the one about minimising tax, is so ingrained in the Australian psyche now that when people of note get caught doing the dodgy on their tax, it’s almost seen as being uniquely Australian and is lauded.

“I don’t think anybody is particularly surprised that Malcolm Turnbull minimises his tax to the point where it’s a negligible amount to him. He’s a cleverboy Rhodes scholar, you’d expect him to know how,”

“You wouldn’t really expect every Tom, Dick and Harry who grew up throwing rocks at cops by day and smoking bike hydro in a skatepark by night to know how to defraud the Australian Tax Office via a complex network of offshore accounts and shell companies, would you? That’s where in inequality comes from,”

“Anyway, nobody cares about that so going into these byelections, we’re just going to say he’s rich and out of touch with the common man. Which is true, he knows all the words to Kubla Khan off-by-heart. When he holds a spherical fruit, he doesn’t instinctively try to rip a leg break and catch it with his other hand. There’s no way he can with on the 28th!”

Coalition Frontbenchers Rock Off To See Who Has To Be Humiliated On Q&A Next Week

TEXT:

The Prime Minister has held his usual cabinet meeting this afternoon to decide which one of them will have to brave the ABC’s Q&A programme next week.

Malcolm Turnbull, aided by Michael McCormack (New Nationals Leader FYI), organised his team into a round-robin-style scissor-paper-rock tournament around 3pm this afternoon and declared that the loser of the competition will be facing the music down at the ABC next Monday night.

Last Tuesday, Nationals Senator and Minister for Resources and Northern Australia, Matt Canavan, just lost out to fellow Queensland National and Ag Minister David Littleproud.

Speaking exclusively to The Advocate regarding the closed-door meeting, former Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce said you could’ve ‘cut the air in the room with a plastic spoon’.

“Fuck!” Canavan allegedly yelled.

“For fuck’s sake! Why me, God?”

Littleproud laughed in relief and then wiped the sweat off the inside of his glasses.

“Fuck, that was close,” he said softly.

Joyce then said even if he did lose the weekly Coalition rock off, there was ‘fuck all chance’ of him doing it.

“I’m trying to keep my head down. I reactivated my Twitter to comment on Q&A last night and people just sent me photos of red things. I get it. But yeah, I would’ve thrown an actual rock at the Prime Minister if he told me to go on Q&A. There’s fuck all chance I’d ever going on that moral Alcatraz again.”

Joyce then said he was done talking to us and hung the phone up.

“Give Us Another Shot” Says Man That Had Twenty Years To Prepare For His Last Shot

TEXT:

Former prime minister Tony Abbott has today issued a warning to the government, saying the Australians he has been talking to, who mostly live in the entitlement belt of North Shore Sydney, are “sick of politicians” and encouraged people who hate politicians to take it out on the bloke who took his job.

Speaking to 2GB yesterday, Tony Abbott revealed he plans to stay in politics for as long as he’s welcome and admits he still has eyes on the top job.

When quizzed on what the future holds for the former Prime Minister, Mr Abbott told the radio host Mark Levy that he’s actually quite enjoying being a backbencher… for now.

“One of the plusses of being on the back bench is that I can speak my mind.

“As long as the Party and the people of Warringah want me, I can see myself staying for quite some time because I’m just 60, I think I’m a young 60.

“Sure, I guess it’s unusual for a Former Prime Minister to come back, you could really only come back if you were drafted by your party.

“But let’s just see how things work out.”

Abbott, who has worked in Canberra since he was in his 20s, and was ousted from the top job nearly two years ago after he thought it would be a good idea to knight Queen Elizabeth’s husband instead of the late Richie Benaud, says Australians feel detached.

He has has warned that he picked up an expectation that Opposition Leader Bill Shorten could soon be installed as prime minister, and says his sworn enemy Malcolm Turnbull should be not underestimate the power of jaded backbenchers like him, who will literally oust leaders every six months if it means they can stay on $200k a year without having do much other than yell ‘shame’ during question time.

Mr Abbott, who is the real deal and well-known for how appropriate his language is around women and his ability to relate to people who aren’t born into an affluent Northern Sydney surf club community, says to retain power and please the public his party who hate him must reform the Senate; stop putting renewable energy before the pussy arse environment; dump the Human Rights Commission and stop using big words.

“Australians are sick of people who spend their life in Canberra, between hosting dinner parties for high-ranking clergymen in their massive leafy North Shore brickhouses” he said.

“Australians are feeling detached”

Derryn Hinch Reveals He Too Has Been Slut-Shamed By Senator Leyonhjelm

TEXT:

Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young says she has received support nationally and internationally, after declaring she has “had enough of men in [Parliament] using sexism” for intimidation.

Hanson-Young says she feels as though Senator David Leyonhjelm was “slut shaming” when he told her to “stop shagging men” during a heated argument about violence against women.

Senator Leyonhjelm could face a parliamentary censure for derogatory remarks made about Senator Hanson-Young, and she has reportedly spoken to lawyers regarding the similarly sexist Sky News coverage of the incident.

Leyonhjelm, leader of the Libertarian minor party, the Liberal Democrats, has refused to apologise to her, telling 7.30: “I’m also entitled to call out double standards.” during a debate about whether only women should be allowed to carry tasers and mace.

However, it appears this isn’t the first time the Senator has sunk as far as bringing up someone’s alleged sexual activities during during a parliamentary debate.

Senator Derryn Hinch has also come out today with further allegations of slut-shaming against Senator Leyonhjelm.

“It’s happened to me as well” he said.

“For some reason, Mr Leyonhjelm thinks it is appropriate to bring up my reputation as somewhat of a pantsman over the last half century”

“I find it inappropriate, regardless of whether these rumours are true.”

Hinch has said that making fun his alleged history as a prominent rooter is about as low as you can go.

“Is this bloke not getting any or something? Why does he care about who’s rootin who, and why does it have anything to do with whether we should change our laws on women carrying tasers?”

It is not yet known if Hinch will be following Hanson-Young’s lead in pressing charges, mainly because Sky News don’t care for, or publicise rumours about his sexual endeavours.

However, several involuntarily celibate Sky News hosts have since labelled Derryn Hinch a ‘Chad’ for his sexually active lifestyle.

NT Intervention Praised For Success In Keeping White Kids Out Of Juvie

TEXT:

Former Prime Mininsters Kevin Rudd, John Howard and Julia Gillard have met over a coffee today to congratulate themselves on not listening to the critics and persevering with the Northern Territory Intervention during their respective governments.

“Fair shake of the sauce bottle” said Kevin Rudd.

“This blanket approach to resolving a made up paedophile rinh was under a lot of scrutiny throughout the four different governments held between the three of us”

Gillard, who hadn’t spoken to Kevin Rudd again since he ousted her – appeared to agree with the her predecessor and successor – for the first since he ousted her.

“Oh absolutely. It took a lot of neg-osee-ating but I think we should pat ourselves on the backs for not listening to civil rights lawyers for two decades”

John Howard was also quick to point out that, while there a very few positive stats to come from their race-based welfare quarantine programs and child-seperating policies, the fact that there are no more white kids in juvie is a great start.

“This will trickle down to the rest” he says.

This bipartison, inter-factional display of self-importance and self-worship comes after news that as of this week, 100% of the children in detention in the Northern Territory are Aboriginal, according to The NT families department.

“The proportions have not changed since the royal commission.” the agency told a parliamentary committee last week.

Nationally, 53% of all young people in detention in 2017 were Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander, and Indigenous young people aged 10 to 17 were 24 times as likely as non-Indigenous young people to be in detention.

Bill Shorten Overtakes Barrie Cassidy For Deepest Forehead Creases In Australian Politics

TEXT:

Labor leader Bill Shorten has this week been recognised for having the most defined forehead creases in the Australian political arena, after finally knocking off media personality and former forehead heavyweight Barrie Cassidy.

Cassidy, a veteran Australian political journalist, as well as a radio and television host and presenter and commentator for the ABC, gracefully conceded defeated on Twitter late last night.

“Bill must be under the pump” he wrote.

“He’s squeezed in two more creases just this year alone. Very impressive. I now hand over the reigns”

The current host of the Sunday morning political commentary program Insiders told the Betoota Advocate that forehead creases are part and parcel with working for the Labor Party, stating that his ones first came to light as the personal media advisor for former Prime Minister Bob Hawke.

“The job can be stressful” he says.

“The divisiveness of the factions and power struggles are a big part of the creases”

“Personally mine were formed during the last days of the Hawke Government, when Keating was doing everything he could to take the job”

Cassidy went on to draw paralells between the unspoken animosity between Hawke and Keating, and the current challenges posed by his arch-nemesis, Anthony Albanese.

“I suspect that a similar thing is happening for Bill right now. Albo is coming around the bend, and Bill isn’t looking like he could lead the party to an election win”

Boring Deputy Prime Minister Needs To Threaten To Kill Someone’s Dogs Or Something

TEXT:

As we near the back-end of the Malcolm Turnbull’s first term as an elected Prime Minister, the possibility of another federal election looms in the peripheral of all politicians, and some voters.

After a chaotic twelve months of citizenship scandals, Chinese collusion and workplace affairs, each and every federal MP appears to be doing whatever they can to reaffirm themselves as a household name for fearing of having to get a real job in the next few months.

Everyone except the incumbent Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack.

The Member for the National Party safe-seat of the Riverina has successfully avoided the spotlight after replacing the bad boy of the Cabinet four months ago – and some might argue this is is plan – after Joyce dragged both the party and their allies through broken glass over the last twelve months with revelations of both sheep and staff shagging.

The career politician who looks like pretty much like every CEO of every ASX listed company to ever exist, has made very little headlines since taking over as leader of the Nats, and in turn Deputy Prime Minister of Australia.

Political analysts say that while McCormack is not at risk of losing the support of the blueblood farmers and Italian winemakers in his electorate, he is very much at risk of being replaced the moment someone else in his party does something remotely interesting.

The Eastern Suburbs rugby dad look-alike has so-far only made media after someone found some weird shit he wrote about gay people ages ago.

Commentators say that it would be very wise of McCormack to threaten to kill a Hollywood celebrities dogs, or better yet, play overly-competitive touch football against journalists on the lawn outside Parliament House ahead of Origin Game III.

“He’s gotta at least threaten to shoot something” says one party insider.

“Or else everyone’s gunna think he’s just another wool-coat cockie”

Albo Visits Parish Priest To Ask Forgiveness For What He Is About To Do To Shorten

TEXT:

With the first cloud of steam of the election season rising to the surface, shadow infrastructure minister Anthony ‘Ablo’ Albanese visited St Brigid’s Catholic Church in Marrickville, to ask Father Erick for forgiveness for what he is about to do to his party leader, Bill Shorten.

Witnesses report seeing Albanese enter the church for confession at approximately 11 am Friday morning at which all churchgoers were ushered outside by members of the Member for Grayndler’s entourage.

Removing his leather gloves, Albanese took a seat in the confessional booth where he skipped over Father Erick’s pleasantries and immediately asked for forgiveness for what he is about to do to his party leader, Bill Shorten.

Rumours state Father Erick pulled back the dividing curtain to look into the Labor MPs eyes in a desperate search for a shred of humanity but was met only by the cold black eyes of a downtrodden man who was willing to dance with the devil to get where he wants.

The confessional is reported to have lasted 55 minutes, before Albo left the booth, adjusting the silk lapels of his Armani double-breasted suit as he does.

Witnesses state Father Erick stayed in the booth and asked a nun if someone would please bring him a glass of water.

Before leaving, witnesses report seeing Albo removing $10,000 from a money clip that he then dumped casually into the donations basket before departing in the backseat of a vintage stretched Rolls Royce.

When asked for comment Father Erick was not able to say what Albo had planned.

“I am bound by a strict oath to never speak a word of what I hear in confession,” said the priest, shaking a little.

“But fuck, I wish I had someone to talk to about what he said. I don’t even know how he entered the church without burning like the sun.”

“Bill, get your passport in order mate! Do not go on that boat!”

Pauline Hanson Considers Ripping Into Asians Again In Last Ditch Effort To Save One Nation

TEXT:

In the face of One Nation’s imminent collapse Pauline Hanson has told party members that she is considering going back to her roots, and abusing Asian immigrants.

“I don’t know. That seemed to work a few decades ago, and there’s even more Asians here now. Maybe I should drop a few ‘swamped by Asians’ on Sunrise a couple times this week.”

“I don’t know really. There’s not much that gets the voters blood boiling anymore. There haven’t been any Muslims doing anything bad for quite a while”

This comes after one of her former loyalists, Brian Burston, has announced that he will quit One Nation and sit as an independent in the Senate after a spectacular falling-out with his party leader.

The New South Wales senator’s departure from the party was widely anticipated after he was embroiled in a bitter feud with Senator Hanson last month, as she proves once again that she might not be the easiest to work with.

Senator Hanson accused Senator Burston of “stabbing her in the back” by continuing to vote alongside the Coalition Government with their proposed company tax cuts, after she was made aware by her anti-bank supporters that she had misread the room with her previous decision to support it.

The One Nation leader also called on him to quit Parliament — but Senator Burston has brushed that demand aside and will remain in the Upper House, just like the last senator that jumped ship minutes after he got sworn in because the other senator had been born in British India and was not a citizen.

This marks the fourth senator that has left Pauline’s team since the 2016 election, out of the three that were elected alongside her.

Speaking to the media from his surf town hub of Caloundra, after being chased out of Byron for punching a 63-year-old surfer in November last year, Xavier says his relationship with uncle Kevin became tested in August 2013 after the Member For Griffith refused to launch a Royal Commission into vaccinations causing autism.

“It was like, man, I knew Peter Garrett was a sell-out with Nuclear power, but not you too Uncle Kev”

“Fair shake of the sauce bottle” said Kevin, when approached by media this afternoon.

“I’ve always consulted Xavier for advice on humanitarian policy. As well as animal rights”

“Everyday Australians Are Sick Of Relatively Organised Political Parties” Says Hanson

TEXT:

Following the news that her last remaining Senator is not doing anything she tells him to do, Pauline Hanson has today declared she will continue to act in the interests of everyday Aussie battlers, who hate seeing political parties achieve things.

“Everyday Australians are sick of this” she said.

“After the Rudd, Gillard, Rudd years. They are starting to feel disillusioned with two major parties that have managed to keep the same leaders for over two years”

After being elected into the upper house with three other One Nation senators in the 2016 election, Pauline Hanson says she’s made a point of severing all relationships with any colleagues since then.

“It’s not about presenting yourselves as an organised, consistent political movement who can continue to grow off the back of divisive comments about minorities” she said.

“For me, it’s always been about in-fighting to the point where I end up doing the exact same thing I did 20 years ago”

Pauline says her party should be congratulated for being so unrefined that she has managed to lose four senators, even though she was only elected with three.

“My party even had a citizenship scandal. Don’t talk to me about being in touch with everyday Australians. One Nation is the only party that does exactly what they expect of us. Back-stabbing eachother to the point of non-existence”

NBN Boss Says People Using The Internet May Be The Leading Cause Of Slow Internet

TEXT:

NBN Co chief executive Bill Morrow has identified online gamers as a major cause of congestion on the network, stating if it wasn’t for them using the internet, the internet wouldn’t be as slow.

Morrow says that NBN Co is “evaluating” slowing down or limiting downloads for users during peak times in order to overcome these fixed wireless congestion problems for people doing other stuff on the internet.

At a parliamentary hearing in Sydney this afternoon, the head of the National Broadband Network said that the heavy users likely targeted by a fair use policy were “gamers predominantly” – because they are kids just playing silly games, and not Baby Boomers trying to binge stream episodes of The Crown.

“While people are gaming it is a high bandwidth requirement that is a steady streaming process,” Mr Morrow told the committee.

“This is where you can do things, where you say, ‘no, no, no, we can only offer you service when you’re not impacting somebody else”

This logical explanation follows similar comments by the Federal Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, Darren Chester MP, who has identified motorists as the key reason behind increased traffic problems in Australia’s metropolitan areas.

Barnaby’s Tell-All Interview About Rooting An Employee Somehow Fails To Repair His Career

TEXT:

In a shocking twist, Barnaby Joyce’s political career is still in tatters, even after telling the entire country the intricate details behind a sexual affair with a much younger staffer who he ended up impregnating, on prime time television.

In a tell-all interview that literally everyone told him was a bad idea, Former Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce has revealed he knew he had impregnated a staffer in mid-2017 around the same time as his citizenship drama. But he went on to fight a by-election without revealing his personal situation.

Mr Joyce and his former media adviser, Vikki Campion, revealed the timeline in a paid interview with Channel Seven.

Surprisingly, these revelations and the subsequent social media backlash hasn’t been any good for Joyce or Campion’s careers.

As someone who came into the public eye as a federal senator, and then a lower house MP, before becoming a cabinet member and eventually the second most powerful politician in this country who was later revealed to have been ineligible to hold any of those positions due his latent New Zealand citizenship, Joyce’s career was already under the pump – well before his lovechild made headlines.

“I suppose I was living a lie,” Joyce conceded at the end of his $150,000 interview last night.

No one in the coalition or opposition have commented on the interview, with many starting to wonder if this can get any worse.

ABC Reportedly Offered Joyce 10-Pack Of Blackrats And Packet Of Smokes For Baby Story

TEXT:

In the wake of the news that former Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce has reportedly accepted at $150,000 payment for a tell-all story about his new family with Channel 7, it can be today revealed that the ABC’s Four Corners had also made a bid for the rights.

Barnaby Joyce and his new partner, Vikki Campion, have reportedly sold the story of their relationship to the Seven Network for $150,000, with the interview to air on the Sunday Night program, months after appealing for privacy and telling the media to “move on”.

While Channel Nine’s 60 Minutes are believed to have pulled on on the bidding war at around the 100k mark, the ABC have had to today declare that they too had a run at it.

“We don’t have much cash floating around here after the budget freeze” said ABC Director Michelle Guthrie.

“But we thought we might be able to persuade him with a ten-pack of pre-mixed Bundy and cokes, as well as twenty Pall Mall Rich Blues.

Guthrie says upon consultation with Pip Courtney from Landline, the Four Corners team were confident that ten or so rumbos is usually all it takes to get Barnaby to open up and little, and the smokes were just complimentary.

However, this humble offer was dismissed the moment the commercial networks started to up their fee to the $100-$200 mark.

“He ended up with $150,000. Which is a bit how ya going” said Guthrie.

“You can buy like 60,000 black rats with that kind of coin”

Joyce’s colleagues have declined to comment on the ethics of a politician accepting money for interviews but the human services minister, Michael Keenan, says he would never do such a thing.

Greens Senator Lee Rhiannon Quits Politics To Focus On New Essential Oils Business

TEXT:

Greens Senator Lee Rhiannon has announced today that she will retire in the next few months to focus on her Essential Oil distillation business.

The controversial senator from NSW whose been in the role for seven years now spoke to our reporters today about her reasons for stepping aside and allowing Mehreen Faruqi to fill the vacant Senate spot.

“Well, there are a few reasons actually for my decision. Obviously, there are the well-publicised issues between myself and other members, particularly those that don’t like me baiting farmers” she said.

“I have spoken out for a while now about how much power Di Natale’s shaman has within our party, and the lack of mandatory chakra alignment for our members,”

“But I also want to focus on a project of mine that I have been working on for a while. Lee’s Leftie Lotions” she said.

Our reporter took a quick minute to open some windows after being overpowered by the pungent aroma of the oils Rhiannon was using before letting her continue.

“So I am moving up to full-scale distillation and cold pressing, and looking at expanding my operation from one Saturday market stall in Balmain, to over 5 around the Greater Sydney area.”

“Oh, and it’s probably going to be good to get someone into the party who isn’t an affluent white person.”

She then tried to offer our reporters some powerful natural healing oils that could prevent ageing and prevent cancer.

Our reporters declined the offers conveniently sighting the MEAA code of ethics for journalists.

We spoke to a local Grazier out the back of Bourke today about the decision.

“You wanna know what I think,” he asked, before pulling his .223 up to his shoulder and greasing a roo some 60 metres away in a neighbouring paddock.

“That’s what I think. Bye Lee.”

Andrew Hastie Fields Stern Phone Call From Sam Dastyari After Chinese Bribery Allegations

TEXT:

Andrew Hastie, the Chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security has had to take an angry phone call from Sam Dastyari this morning after he leveled allegations of bribery and foreign influence at a Chinese National yesterday.

Andrew Hastie used parliamentary privilege to claim businessman Chau Chak Wing funded the bribery of former president of the UN General Assembly John Ashe, and allege that the Chinese Communist Party is seeking to exert its power in Australia.

The ex-Special Air Service soldier reportedly didn’t tell his colleagues that he intended to accuse Dr Chau Chak Wing, (a Chinese National with links to the Chinese Communist Party who has donated over 4 million dollars worth of money to both major parties since 2004) of bribery.

That bold assertion has landed him in hot water with ex-Labor power broker and Chinese Government mouthpiece Sam Dastyari.

Dasher, the former senator from NSW, phone Hastie this morning to light him up.

“Nǐ hǎo Andrew, now you fucking listen to me alright. If you wanna keep chatting shit you won’t be able to go swimming at the beach for the rest of your life alright. Cause if you do you are gonna be the next fucking Harold Holt okay champion,” Dastyari reportedly said to Hastie over the phone this morning.

Hastie responded by telling Dastyari to back up on those threats because he has a very particular set of skills. Skills he acquired over a very long career. Skills that make him a nightmare for people like Sam.

Dastyari then said before hanging up; “Now you might well have had some experience in the Special Services Andrew, but I would like to see you go all Jack Ryan on a midget Chinese Sub picking you off from your nice little family holiday okay. Shieh-Shieh bye now okay.”

Turnbull told us that he was very disappointed with Hastie.

“Very stupid. We have a responsibility to our political donors to ensure that we act in their best interests. I will also be having a stern word to Andrew.”

Bill Shorten refused to give an official statement but told us his position was whatever Malcolm’s was, but the opposite.

Man Who Let His Learners License Expire Says The People Running The Country Are Hopeless

TEXT:

Local youth Taylor McGregor (25) penned a venomous Facebook status today stating ‘this government is bloody hopeless’ while he made his way home on foot, as his learner’s license to expired over a year ago.

With aspirations to one day get his provisional license and make a run at a diploma, McGregor states the inflated wait times and poor service he has experienced at any government agencies are concrete proof this government needs to “get there head out of there arse [sic]” and “pick up there game [sic].”

“How am I even meant to have time to apply for a job when I’m on the phone with them ten hours a fricking week just trying to get paid? Riddle me that Scott Morrisey!” mused McGregor.

According to McGregor, the government’s shortcomings are bi-partisan and politicians spend too little time taking into account people like him who have spent 1000s of hours killing teenagers on Call of Duty but have logged 12 hours learning to drive an automatic car.

“Haha, I fudged a couple of those too mind you!”

McGregor claims to have gotten his learner’s license on his 16th birthday but hasn’t been able to log many hours due to his commitments to trolling feminists online and the fact he has been perpetually hungover for the past half a decade.

“I can drive OK? I just don’t have my license, 100 hours is just too long. If these pollies spent 100 hours trying to sort their shit out maybe Centrelink wouldn’t be so hard on the average battler.”

“I’m gonna get my license, I’ve got decent Lancer in my parent’s garage you know? It just needs new lights and wheels. And maybe if Labor was as committed to booting Shorten as I am flexing my ride, they wouldn’t be in the shit they are now.”

Reporters At Shorten’s Press Conference Distracted By Paint Drying On Wall Behind Him

TEXT:

Bill Shorten has had to interrupt reporters at a press conference this afternoon in an awkward state of affairs.

The Opposition Leader was talking about how slightly different his approach to the budget would have been in an address to a room of reporters from some of the major media outlets, as well as our own Channel Country publication.

However, after a few minutes, Shorten and his advisers noticed that the entire cohort of journos had completely drifted off.

“Hey, did you hear what I just said? You, from Channel 7? Are you listening?” he asked frustratedly.

After some dozy nods and awkward glances around the room, Shorten asked if anyone had any questions for him.

“You guys got any questions? Anything? You can ask me whatever you want. I swear. Even about some of the shit I’ve done in my union capacity,” he said.

“Beaconsfield? Chloe?”

“Fuck youse”

The Advocate can confirm that everyone, in the room including our very own junior reporters had lost track of the presser because they had become distracted by some paint drying on a wall behind the leader of the ALP.

“Yeah, they have put some glossy paint there on the back, sort of behind Bill, and it looks pretty fresh but then it did seem to be drying, so I just got caught up in analysing that whole process you know,” said one journo who asked to remain anonymous.

“I was initially counting the number of square panels on the lectern when he started, but the paint eventually got the better of me,” the journalist said.

“The Money Needs To Come From Somewhere” Says Liberal Voter Wearing Tax Deductible RMs

William Hugosmyth-Willingtley (55) says he’s all for a fair go, but some people are just leeches.

“Mate, it’s all good and well to cry poor me, but where’s the money coming from?”

“Riddle me that? Who’s gonna pay for these people to sit at home and do nothing because they have chosen to live that life?”

After a harsh upbringing in ‘the rough part’ of Sydney’s North Shore and a few failed business ventures throughout his twenties, William says he knows more than anyone that hard work, presentation and eagerness is the only three things you need to do well in this country.

“I mean, seriously. How much more tax do I need to reluctantly pay until people realise that nothing is free in this world”

“Tax dollars should be spent on failed light rail infrastructure projects and Royal Commissions, not some bludgers in the houso blocks”

“It’s not that hard to get a decent pair of boots on your feet and find a bit of work”

Study Fails To Find Anything Remotely Cool Or Practical About Using An Apple Watch

TEXT:

Bad news for Apple fans, a recent study by the CSIRO has concluded that there’s no redeemable benefit of owning an Apple Watch.

The results of the year-long research project were published this morning to mild outrage among local gadget enthusiasts and tech-savvy early adopters.

Detailing the ‘cool factor’ as well as the practicality of the device, the CSIRO wasn’t able to find a single thing remotely attractive or useful about using the popular smartwatch.

“If you’ve ever seen someone use an Apple Watch on the street, you won’t need to read this paper’s findings,” said the CSIRO’s Peter Flanagan.

“This research is more for people who are still sitting on the fence. Thinking whether or not they’re going to buy one. In our opinion, owning an Apple Watch is not cool and for those thinking of buying one, you can buy something cool like an illegal firearm or bootleg fireworks for around the same price,”

One early adopter and Apple Watch devotee have lashed out at the government science bureau, saying they’re simply publishing their own opinion as fact.

However, we here at The Advocate trust and value the opinion of the CSIRO over that of the average Apple fanboy – making their opinion on this matter invalid and unfit to print.

Turnbull Concedes He Had To Give Banks Time To Shred Documents Before Royal Commission

TEXT:

The Prime Minister has told the media this morning that he admits failures were made on his government’s part in delaying the Royal Commission into the banking industry.

In addition to that, Malcolm Turnbull also conceded and defending his judgement – saying he had to give the banks time to prepare for the investigation.

“Mistakes were made and I accept full responsibility for the Royal Commission’s delay,”

“However, there were a number of important documents that needed to be shredded. There were offshore bank accounts that needed to be dusted off, you know, that type of boring banker speak,”

“To the layperson, the banks needed to make sure they were fully prepared and compliant in time for the Royal Commission. If we were to start without the banks being prepared, it would’ve cost the taxpayer even more and taken jobs overseas. Is that why the people of Australia elected my government? No.”

A few brave journalists, one of them was surprisingly from the ABC, asked the PM whether it was wise to let the banks destroy key evidence prior to the investigation – to which the PM said ‘no’.

“Weak banks mean a weak economy. A weak economy means no jobs and endless peril for all Australians. I trust you understand. If we didn’t have a GFC, Bill Shorten would still be shouting down collapsed mineshafts from South West Cape to the Barrow Island,”

“And that’s God’s honest truth.”

Morrison Says This Shit He Knew About For Years Is Not A Good Look For The Banks

TEXT:

Australian Treasurer Scott Morrison and Financial Services Minister Kelly O’Dwyer will announce on Friday new criminal penalties of up to 10 years’ jail and maximum fines of $945,000 for individuals doing stuff that he has known about for years.

Some of the initial findings shows rampant breaching of the Corporations Act, actions which have ruined the lives of  thousands of Australians and until now was only really a sackable offence upon being caught, with very few bankers facing criminal prosecution

Mr Morrison said government agencies already knew about the problems identified by commissioner Kenneth Hayne, which include low-level corruption, kick backs and poor lending standards.

“Yeah, it’s nothing new” he said.

“But, either way. It’s not a good look for the banks”

“I can’t believe this shit that I’ve known about for years has been happening for so long”

No top bank executive has lost their job because of information exposed by the inquiry, which will cost each of the big four banks an estimated $100 million each, mostly in legal fees, and could cost the government $70 million.

Morrison says he’ll try and do as much as he can about this, but it’s not like they’ve done anything super immoral like claiming Centrelink without declaring an income of over $253.00 per week.

“I’m Not Out For Revenge” Says Abbott In An Attempt To Mislead Public

TEXT:

The former Prime Minister has told reporters today in the bush capital that he’s not out to depose Malcolm Turnbull as leader.

Tony Abbott, who famously lost the job to the more popular merchant banker in 2015, made the statement with his left hand cocked behind his back with his fingers crossed.

“Malcolm Turnbull will take the Liberal Party to the next election because he’s more popular than Bill Shorten, which in turn will get him elected,” said Abbott.

“I am not out for revenge, I am not working with the right-faction to either install myself or Long John Dutton into the hot seat,”

“As far as I’m concerned, it’s business as usual.”

However, a number of journalists were left scratching their heads after the statement.

Abbott then excused himself and walk back into the House of Representatives wing.

Many saw Mr Abbott’s fingers cross behind his back, which some in the industry consider being associated with telling a lie.

“I’m not entirely convinced he was being truthful with us,” said one overpaid and underworked ABC reporter.

What’s This Cunt On About Now?

Australian Conservatives federal leader Cory Bernardi has returned from his Easter long weekend with a new highly personalised grievances that have somehow become national news.

It appears his conspiracies about lefties taking the Christianity out of the chocolates and bunny rabbits have taken a back seat as the very minor party Senator informs the world of some other shit that’s worrying him.

The former professional rower who defected from the Liberal Party to start his own party has lashed out at his former South Australian colleagues, accusing them of white-anting his party from within by considering joining the Liberal Party.

Prior to his most recent headlines, Bernardi’s last appearance in the news was related to his disgust at being referred to as a cunt by the ABC – however, his newest tantrum is believed to actually be related to politics, leaving many Australians to ponder, what’s this cunt on about now?”

The party’s South Australian leader, Dennis Hood, announced on Monday he was quitting to join Premier Steven Marshall’s newly-elected Liberal government.

It was later revealed that Mr Hood had been encouraged to consider the move by his Conservatives colleague Robert Brokenshire, who was up for re-election at this month’s poll.

With the count of Legislative Council votes yet to be finalised, Mr Brokenshire, a former Liberal minister, appears unlikely to be returned.

This internal conflict appears to be more dramatic than the internal conflict Bernardi detested in his last party, which he left to start his own party, before all of his new colleagues started defecting to the his old party.

Malcolm Turnbull’s on and off lead over Bill Shorten as the preferred prime minister has come to a standstill, following the chaos that resulted from Barnaby Joyce’s  love-child scandal and blatant bias towards upper-middle class baby boomers with a new collection of coalition policies on the table,

The sharp drop in the Prime Minister’s personal ratings in the past month comes as Mr Turnbull approaches the benchmark 30 Newspolls behind Labor, which he set as a measure of failure when he challenged Tony Abbott for the leadership.

Following this news, former Prime Minister Tony Abbott appears to making moves to take back the throne, by doing exactly what it was that got him ousted in the first place.

Standing before a media scrum salivating at the thought of him criticising his party leader on camera, Abbott has brought with him his trusty set of eight Australian flags and started reminding everyone that it was him that made boat people dissapear into the night.

“I ahhh. Just want to say. Ahhh. Boats” said Abbott.

“Stop the boats. Boats, boats, boats, boats, ANZAC, respect the diggers. Defund the ABC. White South Africans. Footy. Mateship. Blokes”

“Apex gang”

As the crowd stirs, Abbott toys with whether or not he should whip out his draw four card. He goes for it.

“We should have listened to Pauline” he says.

It is not yet known whether or not Abbott has managed to create any ripples in his own party, or in the national psyche, as he is still being haunted by photographs of him attending his own sister’s gay wedding.

Throwback Thursday: Dutton Rocks The Three-Quarter Cargos From His Undercover Cop Days

TEXT:

As excitement brews in the office of Home Affairs about a possible leadership spill, Peter Dutton MP has today thrown on what he calls ‘civilian clothes’ in an attempt to prove to the Australian public that he is in fact a normal human.

It is believed Dutton went searching through the basement of his Canberra rental this morning to find a pair of quadruple-pocketed three-quarter cargo shorts – an outfit staple from back in the day when he was arresting homeless people for marijuana possession on Brisbane’s Ferny Grove line.

As a former undercover drug detective from Brisbane, Peter Dutton’s entire understanding on ‘casual wear’ is related directly to clothes that cops try to wear to look like they aren’t cops.

Commonly seen undercover cop attire includes three-quarter cargo shorts, three-quarter denim shorts, Quicksilver button ups and New Balance sneakers.

As the embattled Prime Minister faces yet another unflattering newspoll survey, his only far-right-wing ally in the Coalition looks to be making a move on the youth vote, by rocking up to Parliament in his funky casual threads.

It is believed while getting dressed for work this morning, Dutton was unable to find a t-shirt that didn’t have a ‘marriage alliance’ logo sprawled across the front of it, and had to settle for a work shirt with rolled up sleeves.

“Haha. Gotta catch the last of the warmer weather” said the Minister, while bending over to fold up the hem on his groovy shorts.

“Because, like any normal humans, I enjoy summer”

“I also like footy ball and white people”

“Aussie Aussie”

Abbott Launches New Pauline Book That Doesn’t Include The Bit Where He Had Her Jailed

TEXT:

The man that was behind a trust fund set up to fund civil cases against One Nation in the 1990s, which eventually saw Pauline Hanson incarcerated for electoral fraud, has today launched her newest biography in a weird showing of unity.

Tony Abbott, who was sic’d onto Pauline by John Howard when her party began to look like a threat to the Liberals, has today endorsed her as both a politician and a person, after being essentially ostracised by both the left and right wing factions of his own party and not having anything to do or say because gay marriage is now legal.

Pauline Hanson’s first demise was so spectacular that in August 2003, Hanson was jailed after she and her adviser at the time, David Ettridge, were found guilty of fraudulently registering One Nation, in a desperate bid to get back into the spotlight that shone so brightly on her in 1997.

Since her reality TV return to the limelight earlier this decade, Pauline has quite often publicly blamed Mr Abbott for her brief imprisonment for electoral fraud, a conviction that was later quashed.

The book, which doesn’t include nearly as many mentions of cannibalistic Aboriginals and Lesbian Chinese-Indian Prime Ministers as her last book, is titled ‘In Her Own Words’ – and features a book cover that shows Pauline wearing a burkha, which kind of makes it look like she’s secretly been a Muslim this whole time.

Today’s book launch comes 15 years after Senator Hanson was released from prison and was quoted saying “Heaven help this country if Tony Abbott is ever in control of it. I detest the man.”

However, a decade after her release and as several years after Abbott was, in fact, in control of the country. The relationship has changed.

It has been proven before thatxenophobic North Shore elites can quite be prone to getting a little excited by the red-haired former Ipswich Fish and Chip shop owner – like the original One Nation founders Oldfield and Ettridge – both of whom were rumoured to have had a shine for Pauline.

The book has been written by her controversial chief-of-staff James Ashby, who is currently at the centre of her most recent electoral fraud allegations.

Malcolm Turnbull told our reporters that he’s hours away from getting the controversial legislation through the red room, making it law.

He remains hopeful that he’ll get it all put to bed before the nation stops shaking its collective head at Steve Smith and his leadership team of apparent cheats.

“The savings these large companies will make on tax will trickle all the way down from the boardroom to the broom handle, I can assure you,”

“If they don’t, I promise to hold some sort of Senate committee, whatever that means, or even another Royal Commission into the banks after this one is done. Enough about that, we’ve created a lot of jobs. Can I tell you about them?”

Our reporter said no.

When The Advocate asked Mr Turnbull if he thought it was ‘unethical’ to push policy through when the public is looking elsewhere, he explained that it’s just politics and that Australians shouldn’t be surprised – or even upset by it.

“It is what it is, then you die,” said Malcolm.

Turnbull Concerned He Might Not Be Remembered As The Greatest PM Of All Time

TEXT:

The Prime Minister has reportedly begun voicing concerns this morning that his dream of being remembered as the greatest leader this country has ever known might not come true.

Speaking candidly to The Advocate this morning via telephone, Malcolm Turnbull said that a few things have happened recently which might, in the future, look bad.

“I didn’t get into politics for the money or the glory,” he said.

“The reason why I got into this game is that I wanted to be the best at it. I was the best banker in Sydney, the best lawyer. Back in the day, I was unstoppable. Even in New York City, people would tremble in my presence,”

“I fucking relished in it, I did. Now, look at me. I have some of the most powerful men in America kissing the sole of my shoes 30 years ago. Now I’ve got thank Peter Dutton and the rest of the God Squad for keeping me in power every morning. I think history won’t be kind to me if I keep it up.”

The Point Pipernese sexagenarian’s fears were confirmed by a number of political pundits, who said that there’s been a number of recent errors – among many others – that history will not remember fondly.

One of them being Peter Dutton himself, who told The Advocate (which he considers the last impartial media outlet that isn’t dead to him) that Malcolm isn’t the same Malcolm that people first met when he became an elected official.

However, just prior to giving comment on the matter, Dutton noticed that our reporter was wearing Vans and promptly declared our small town newspaper to be left-leaning.

Alex Bhathal’s Unaligned Chakras To Blame For Batman By Election Loss, Says Di Natale

TEXT:

After the Greens shock loss in the Batman by-election on the weekend, left-wing figures around the country have been asking questions.

Questions, which have been answered today, by spiritual guru and leader of the Greens, Richard Di Natale.

Di Natale has told The Advocate, that Alex Bhathal’s 6th electoral loss in Batman can be attributed to her chakras being all over the place.

“Yeah, I ordered a spiritual healer of mine to conduct an assessment on her (Bhathal), and he discovered that there was serious chaos within her internal energy,” Di Natale said.

For those who may not have spent a lot of time around the Northern Rivers of NSW, or inner city Melbourne, chakras are energy centres within the human body that help to regulate all its processes and keep you healthy.

According to alternative medicine practitioners, kinesiologists and witch doctors, there are 7 chakras or energy centres within your body, and each chakra has its own vibrational frequency and ‘governs specific functions that help make you, well, human.’

Di Natale explained that in hindsight, he should have had the assessment done before beginning the campaign.

“There is no way she was ever going to win, let alone lead a healthy life, with even a single chakra out of place,” he said.

“It’s extremely concerning, and I will be looking at introducing party policy that attempts to prevent debacles like this in future.”

Jade Saskia-Evans from the Alternative Medicine Provided At Extortionate Financial Cost Body Of Australia (AMPAEFCBA) echoed this statement and encouraged anyone with concerns about their chakras to come in and have them seen to for only a couple of hundred dollars a session.

Nadesalingam and Priya, and their children aged two years and nine months, have lived in the remote Queensland town of Biloela for several years. That was until Australian Border Force officers, police and Serco guards raided their home at dawn last week, taking the husband and wife and their two Australia-born children into custody.

Dutton has today praised the work of his gallant Border Force soldiers for opening up a job at the Teys meatworks in Biloela, where Nadesalingam was employed as a labourer.

“Today, a coalition voter now has the opportunity to find work in a town 200km west of Rockhampton. That’s why we do this”

“And for that, I applaud the brave people who drove across the country to this sleepy rural working class town to rectify the wrongs perpetrated by these aliens”

Dutton went on to explain why it is so important to deport migrants the moment they show signs of struggling in their dealings with the bureaucracy that makes up the immigration department.

“This week, we opened up a job that was undeservedly given to someone who was unable to travel 1800 kilometres to Sydney and update his Visa in time”

“That’s one less working class family that doesn’t deserve to be living in Biloela, by birthright”

“If there are any other unorganised subcontintentals hiding in the 15,729 square kilometres that make up the Banana Shire…”

Bob Katter Refuses To Disclose Where His Deadly New Boots Came From

TEXT:

The Honourable Bob Katter III MP has told journalists he won’t be spending anymore time on this issue that surrounds where he got his flash new boots.

The leather boots, which don’t look like they’ve been made by his mates at Prospect Street, appear to be made out of a reptillian animal hide.

This has led to questions that Katter may have been discreetly killing crocodiles in the Deep North, following his blow up about civillian deaths related to the animal late last year.

In a doorstop interview following the marriage equality plebiscite result, Mr Katter said people were “entitled to their sexual proclivities, let there be a thousand blossoms bloom” before his demeanour darkened and he declared he would spend no more time on the topic.

“Because in the meantime, every three months a person is torn to pieces by a crocodile in north Queensland,” he said.

In response to accusations that he has been firing bullets into the now endangered loung lizards, Katter was quite to put his dukes up.

“A mate gave ’em to me. Why do you care?” roared the Maverick North Queensland Independent after being meet with a media scrum on his way out of Parliament House.

“Sorry should I be wearing square toed Italian leather when I grace the halls of Parliament house? That’s not what we do in the Curry. Maybe in Point Piper – but not up top”

Promising Young Labor Member Thankful For Working Class Values Passed Down By Art Critic Father In West End

TEXT:

The daughter of a prominent West End-based art critic says she wouldn’t be nearly well equipped enough to fight the good fight of low level youth politics if her father hadn’t instilled into her the humble sensibilities most commonly associated with Australia’s working class.

Manila Weatherly (23) says unlike the trustfunded elite that make up her rival party in the pointless echo chamber of university politics, she actually knows how hard it is

“My dad, was like, he worked really hard” she says, while talking about her upbringing in the Bohemian inner-city Brisbane suburb.

Manila says her father, Rylance (62) wouldn’t let the fact that he was too opposed to organised religion to send her to private school get in the way of her having a decent education at an equally ranked inner-city selective school just down the road.

She says watching him head out each evening to head to work, to peruse gallery openings, instilled a deep-seated appreciation for the working man, and woman.

“Eventually Fairfax gave him a column when I was about to start high school. But before that, he was having to play one or two gigs a week with his Go-Betweens cover bands… just to pay the bills”

He’d even set up a stall and sell mum’s hand creams and incense at the markets on Sundays… Anything to get by”

With the Australian economic divide now more evident than ever before, Manila says the Labor party needs to embrace their grassroots and penetrate these working class communities that stupidly vote for populists because they have bad educations and are latently racist.

“It’s not their fault that they are being mislead and voting for the wrong party. All they do is work in factories and watch sport”

The growing divided between the public and Australia’s news organisations and politicians has been on display for all over the last month, sexual rumours, innuendo and personal attacks make their way out of hotel rooms and into the headlines.

Popularised in early 1990s British comedies, the word ‘bonk’ has made a return to national vernacular as journalists and politicians begin to sound like undercover cops in their attempts to latch on to lingo.

Starting with the former Deputy Prime Minister’s lovechild, and now Senator Michaelia Cash’s comments surrounding more whispers in the Labor camp, Australian voters are begging the media and politicians to stop saying the word bonk.

“It’s not a thing” said one protestor, Shayleigh (22) from Betoota Ponds.

“Literally no one says bonk. This isn’t a fucking Austen Powers movie. Is that honestly how these people talk about sex?”

Last month, the Prime Minister strengthened the code of conduct for cabinet ministers, but there is nothing similar for MPs – stating he was only focused on cracking down on sex between high-ranking politicians and their staff. A new rule that has been dubbed ‘The Bonk Ban’ by people who don’t sound like they have sex much.

Senator Paterson Feeling Both Political And Youthful In His Flash New Brown Suit

TEXT:

Liberal Senator for Victoria, James Paterson has stepped out in style this afternoon.

The career politician appears to be struggling after he turned the big three oh a few months back, and has made an attempt at combating his quarter life crisis by buying some new threads.

Paterson, who previously had only ever made news when people were talking about how dysfunctional and damaging it is for democracy for someone to immediately enter federal politics straight after university – is making headlines for all the right reasons.

It is believed the equally self-important millennials working in the Parliament press gallery were quick to comment on Paterson’s ‘cute AF milo-esque suit’.

“You might make GQ this year big fella” said one Buzzfeed employee.

In March 2016, the Victorian division of the Liberal Party of Australia nominated Paterson to fill the casual vacancy in the Australian Senate caused by the resignation of Michael Ronaldson. Paterson was appointed by a joint sitting of the Parliament of Victoria on 9 March 2016. Just in case you didn’t know who this cunt was.

However, Paterson is now a household name, all thanks to the new suit that perfectly matches both his age and politics.

“Damnnn” said fellow Liberal senator, Eric Abetz, after spotting Paterson in the hallway at Parliament house this afternoon.

“My great uncle used to own a suit like that”

Bill Shorten Says He’s Open To Saving Great Barrier Reef, Maybe, If You Vote For Him

TEXT:

Bill Shorten has reportedly told environmental groups that he is open to possibly rushing to rescue planet earth’s oldest living organism and Australia’s greatest natural wonder, possibly.

This, however, would require Shorten to take steps to revoking the Adani mine licence, and in turn butting heads with just about every pro-coal bureaucrat in federal and Queensland politics.

“Maybs” said Shorten.

“Like, what you all need to focus on is voting me in first. That’s the first step to this maybe happening”

Businessman and environmentalist Geoff Cousins says Opposition Leader Bill Shorten told him that if Labor wins government he might do something vaguely likeable, maybe.

Mr Cousins, former president of the Australian Conservation Foundation, told 7.30 that Mr Shorten made the statement to him privately last month.

“The key statement was that, ‘When we are in government, if the evidence is as compelling as we presently believe it to be regarding the approval of the Adani mine, we will revoke the licence, as allowed in the act. That’s a clear policy’,” Mr Cousins said.

He said the conversation took place when Mr Shorten asked him for advice about the environmental impact of the Adani mine in Queensland’s Galilee Basin and Great Barrier Reef – before not saying anything about his position on the controversial mine publicly.

“Just wait and see” said Shorten.

“Like the gay marriage thing. That was something I would have possibly passed if I was in government. But I didn’t get voted in so no one got to see whether or not I was going to do it”

“Right now, it’s a firm maybe”

“Within the first 100 days we will reveal our position on it”

Trump Reportedly Declined Turnbull’s Offer Of Traditional Shoey During Meeting

TEXT:

The Prime Minister has refused to comment on his American counterpart declining a traditional shoey during a meeting, saying only he respected his wishes not to have one.

“I will not be talking about that incident,” he said. “Next question.”

But that incident has begun to overshadow his visit to Washington.

Malcolm Turnbull reportedly removed his boot during high-level talks with Donald Trump over the weekend and filled it with a crisp lager – then offered it up to the president.

“Get this into, you big red bastard,” beckoned Turnbull as per the cultural custom dictates.

“Hey woah, get that thing away from me! What the hell are you doing?” replied Trump.

Turnbull, perplexed by the rejection of the said shoey, stuttered through an explanation.

“It’s just what we do, mate,” said Turnbull as the beer quickly leaked through the seams.

“Nobody knows why. We just started drinking out of shoes one day.”

“What the fuck is the matter with you, put your goddamn shoe back on. Jesus H Christ, have some self-respect for yourself.”

The Prime Minister then finished the shoey himself.

“That’s got to be one of the dumbest things I’ve ever seen in my whole fucking life!” said Trump.

“Can we get back to business now?”

Malcolm nodded and apologised before clearing his through to give his opinion on nuclear weapons.

Mathias Cormann’s First Act as Acting PM Was To Appoint Jean-Claude Van Damme His Deputy

TEXT:

Belgian-born acting Prime Minister Mathais Cormann has taken advantage of his newfound powers by appointing Belgian-born action star Jean-Claude Van Damme as his deputy.

The West Australian also threw the gauntlet down to Malcolm Turnbull, saying that he could have his old job back – he just has to get through both of them first.

He invited The Advocate into the PM’s office for a short, to-the-point interview.

“Very happy to have Jean-Claude on the team,” said Cormann, who sat feet up on Turnbull’s desk cleaning his personal FN-FAL.

“Yah, sure. Malcolm can be Prime Minister against if he wants. All he has to do is come in here and take the keys from my cold dead hands,”

“Isn’t that right, JVD?”

Jean-Claude emerged from the Prime Minister’s private washroom, drying her hands on the front of his suit pants.

“Yah, Matty C. If he ever wants to see all those monogrammed washrags in the toilet back, he’s got to go through me, yah?”

He point a finger to his chest, revealing two Walther PPQs in shoulder holsters under his jacket.

“You seen the end of Universal Soldier? It’ll be just like that when Malcolm comes back from Trumpstan. Mathias will inject me with the muscle enhancers and somebody will get impaled on something.”

Cormann laughed.

“And if this Fiji-style coup fails to materialise, we’re going to flee to Perth and secede.”

The pair then high-fived and told our reporter to get out before they threw him out the window.

PM Regretfully Confirms Barnaby Joyce Has Taken Leave To Appear On I’m A Celebrity!

TEXT:

Just when it seemed things couldn’t get any worse for Malcolm Turnbull, they have.

This morning, the Prime Minister was forced to address rumours that his deputy Barnaby Joyce had taken leave not to hide from the spotlight of public outrage – but to appear on Network Ten’s cornerstone programme, I’m A Celebrity! Get Me Out Of Here!

Turnbull spoke to waiting journalists today at the Lower House entrance in Canberra around 10 am this morning.

“At this time, I can confirm that Barnaby Joyce, the Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of The Nationals, has taken leave from parliament to star on that ‘I’m A Celebrity’ show on Channel Ten,” he said.

“It’s disappointing that this has happened, I had no control over it. It’s a National Party initiative to repair his image and rebrand Mr Joyce as a knock-about bloke who’s been judged too harshly for his many, many trespasses,”

“That’s all I’m prepared to say at this time, thank you.”

The Advocate reached out to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister but have yet to receive a response.

A representative from the reality television programme did answer our reporter’s queries, outlining the coup to get Joyce on the show and the purpose behind it.

“Commerical television is a lot like politics,” said Jack Hewitt, the show’s fourth-unit director.

“You need to keep things fresh, keep it in the headlines. We’ve been able to keep the ratings up by bringing the flavour of each month on. When everyone was hounding Bernard Tomic for having no ticker, we got him on the show and basically paid him to quit,”

“So it’d generate headlines. We got Danny Green and The Man Mundine on the show because respectfully hate each other and it makes fireworks. Now that Joyce is coming on the show next week, we can expect another ratings bonanza. Nothing is what it seems on television, just like politics.”

Seething Barnaby Wonders If The Point Piper Toff Could Even Land A Fucking Glove On Him

TEXT:

A visible divide down the middle of the Coalition was on display the afternoon, as the Deputy Prime Minister began fantasising about having a dip with the top hat.

During a reluctant meeting between the Nationals Leader and Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, the Deputy was seen to be drifting off while daydreaming about dusting off the elite Eastern Suburbs politician, while still seething over Turnbull’s media conference yesterday.

Mr Turnbull began an announcement about banning sex between ministers and their staffers by describing Mr Joyce’s behaviour as, “a shocking error of judgement” that “set off a world of woe”.

Today, the Deputy Prime Minister said the comments caused “further harm” to his family.

While both men were forced by colleagues to talk it out in a Parliament backroom today, Barnaby Joyce began wondering if, hypothetically, Malcolm Turnbull would even stand a chance against him in a Tamworth-style punch on.

“I don’t think that little toff would even land a fucking glove on me” he said to himself.

“I don’t think he would last a fucking minute. He’s never seen me in full flight at the Albert”

“We aren’t in Point Piper anymore your majesty”

This comes shortly after a angry-sounding Joyce approached the media to accuse the PM of making his life harder with comments he gave yesterday about the extramarital affair between Mr Joyce and his former staffer.

“Comments by the Prime Minister yesterday at his press conference … in many instances, they caused further harm. I believe they were in many instances inept and most definitely in many instances unnecessary,” he said.

Deputy PM Under Siege After Revelations That He Also Rooted The Murray Darling

TEXT:

Mutiny against Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce is now in the open, with backbencher Ken O’Dowd speaking out on his way into Parliament this morning.

This comes as a result of the public backlash Nationals are facing from their constituents about the way he has handled his marriage breakdown and new relationship.

However, things are only getting worse for Mr Joyce, as another prominent affair is brought into the limelight.

ABC Four Corners can reveal that Barnaby Joyce has also fucked the Murray-Darling basin.

The Murray–Darling basin is a large geographical area in the interior of southeastern Australia. Its name is derived from its two major rivers, the Murray River and the Darling River. The basin, which drains around one-seventh of the Australian land mass, is one of the most significant agricultural areas in Australia. It spans most of the states of New South Wales, Victoria, and the Australian Capital Territory, and parts of the states of Queensland (lower third) and South Australia (southeastern corner).

Allegations of water theft and meter tampering in New South Wales aired by the ABC’s Four Corners program have prompted the Commonwealth Auditor-General to expand an investigation into the Federal Department of Agriculture and Water Resources, a job that was held by the Deputy Prime Minister up until his citizenship saga last year.

Sources inside the National Party have confirmed that Barnaby Joyce has been ‘fucking’ the Murray-Darling on the side for many years now, but unlike his most public affair he has been using protection – namely the cotton blue bloods in North New South Wales.

However, this particular affiar isn’t Barnaby Joyce’s number on issue right now, as the media vultures begins to circle in on his baby mama drama.

But Nationals Cabinet minister and member for Betoota David Littleproud demanded Mr Joyce’s critics should “put up or shut up” and to “stop being so gotdam Vanilla about a bit of rooting around”.

Barnaby Joyce Will Attempt To Play The Saxophone On ‘The Project’ To Repair His Image

TEXT:

Following in the footsteps of Bill Clinton, the under-siege Deputy Prime Minister will play the saxophone on The Project tonight in an effort to repair his tattered image.

The news was confirmed this afternoon by Barnaby Joyce’s office within Parliament House.

Question Time today was difficult for Mr Joyce and Malcolm Turnbull as they both faced a slew of lewd innuendo and snide remarks from their political opponents.

However, the Member for New England is looking toward the horizon.

In a short statement a moment ago, the former senator said he plans to weather the storm and showcase some of his other talents he can offer his constituents.

“I’m going on The Project tonight and I’m bringing a saxophone with me,” he wrote.

“Never in my life have I ever played the saxophone. I haven’t even picked one up before. But let it be known, I will play that saxophone until you see me for who I truly am. If It worked for Bill Clinton, it’ll work for Old Barn.”

Producers from the popular youth-orientated variety show have defended themselves against criticism, even going to the point of threatening to unleash the network’s on-retainer Gerard Malouf & Partners solicitor on anybody who’s game to take them on.

“Barnaby rang us this afternoon and asked if he could come on the show and play the saxophone,” said one producer.

“Naturally we said yes. He even asked for a little stand to put his sheet music on. Then he rambled on a bit about being a Phoneix rising from the pyres of hell,”

“Apparently he’s never played an instrument before so we’re looking forward to seeing what’s going to go down.”

Di Natale Studies Old Crocodile Hunter Episodes In Case He Needs To Save One From Katter

TEXT:

The Greens leader said he didn’t mean to take any limelight away from the Deputy Prime Minister this afternoon but according to many in Canberra, he has.

Richard Di Natale told waiting journalists this afternoon in the nation’s capital that he’s been watching and studying old episode of The Crocodile Hunter in order to gain a better understanding of the majestic beasts.

He wants to gain a better understanding because he wants to save them from maverick Queensland member, Bob Katter.

“I know, deep down, that there will be a time and place where I need to put myself between Bob Katter and a crocodile,” he said.

“And if I can’t do that rationally, like with some carefully-worded legislation, I need to get a little dirty.”

By dirty, the barnstorming Victorian means he’s not going to break the law – he’s going to break a sweat.

“I will drag, wrestle and fight to save a crocodile from being shot. If I get torn to shreds, which I won’t, so be it. Carpe fucking diem. Which reminds me… why can’t he just shoot carp? I’ve killed lots of animals in my dad but they’ve all been carp.”

The Advocate reached out to the Office of the Member for Kennedy and received a short statement in reply.

In the statement, Bob Katter says he will also drag, wrestle and fight Richard Di Natale to stop him from being torn to shreds by a crocodile.

“He can do what he wants but if I come across him in a mangrove or lignum, I’ll jump out of my Quintrex and wrestle the bloke in. It’s no place for a man of science up in the Cape,” he wrote.

“I hope he knows what he’s getting himself into.”

Barnaby Blames Affair On Wipe-On-Sex-Appeal From Pub Bathroom Vending Machine

TEXT:

Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce has reportedly laid the blame of his recent affair with a staffer Vikki Campion on his drunken decision to lather his neck with a wipe-on-sex appeal sachet.

Popular in regional pub bathrooms and truck stops, the Wipe-On sex appeal has proven time and time again to be the number one pheromone scent.

In December 2015, a Betoota local admitted he successfully ‘got a root’ after trialling the product in a local nightclub.

Sources close to the red-faced sex icon say after experiencing a renewed interest from passing females, Mr Joyce decided to make a habit of using the sachets, believing that it may help him politically if he was able to mesmerise the opposite sex after wiping his neck and wrists.

It is believed that it was not just Ms Campion that found the Member For New England wildly irresistible in the brief few weeks he spent wearing the leading Australian pheromone wipe – but he was unable to fend off the affair as she was just too persistent.

“Barnaby never wanted this. But the women just found him too sexy” said one source close to the Nationals leader.

“He was really bringing sexy back for a while there. We are all very glad he stopped wearing it”

“…There could have been many more kids”

Albo Calls For Investigation Into Who The Fuck Keyed His Charger

TEXT:

The Federal Member For Grayndler, Anthony Albanese says he doesn’t want to point fingers but he has a fairly good idea about who scraped a key down the side of his beloved Valiant Charger in the Parliament House car park yesterday afternoon.

Dubbed ‘The Marrickville Mercedes’ – the Valiant Charger has for several decades been a popular vehicle for young bucks in light industrial suburbs.

However, as was the case out many bottle shop carparks across the countries in the 80s and 90s, any disrespect shown towards this particular make of car can usually result in a punch in the head.

“Someone needs to own up to this” says Albo.

“I’ve got a lot of hardheaded mates at the bar of the Orange Grove in Balmain who’d gladly have a sniff around for me. But, I’d like ASIO to get to the bottom of it first”

It is rumoured that while Christopher Pyne was initially suspect number one in the keying of Albo’s whip, attention has now turned to the right-faction of the Labor party. This follows the Labor party’s quite blatant move to trotting out their greenest faces in an attempt to win back the inner-Melbourne seat of Batman in yet another citizenship-related by-election.

As Shorten’s poll numbers drop, the kingmakers are beginning to look to the husky Italian from the inner-west to lead the party into battle with Turnbull – leading many to believe that the vandalism of Albanese’s car may have come from the leader of his own party

“I don’t give a fuck who he’s mates with” says Albanese.

“I’ll give him the old Henson Park kiss if he wants to keep this shit up”

Top Secret Government Documents Found In Boot Of Abandoned Kingswood 20km Out Of ACT

TEXT:

Just when you thought things couldn’t get any weirder, another batch of documents containing five governments worth of secret dirt files have been found in the boot of an abandoned 1974 Holden Kingswood, just outside of the Canberra city limits.

This comes just hours after ASIO agents have entered ABC offices in Canberra and Brisbane this morning to secure thousands of top-secret and classified Cabinet files left inside two filing cabinets sold at a second-hand shop.

The filing cabinets sat unopened for some months in the home of the buyer who eventually decided to drill them open. The ABC said the cabinets had been sold at a second-hand shop which stocked ex-government furniture and were cheap because they were locked and came without keys.

Dubbed ‘The Kingswood Files’ – the documents detail heaps of kind of dodgy stuff but nothing really incriminating. However, one thing they do confirm is that most politicians are fuckwits.

The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation has given comments regarding the newest batch of weirdly sensitive government files to make their way out of Parliament House and into the hands of civillians.

“What’s the fucking point” said the ASIO spokesperson.

“Like, we try our very best to protect this information, but we aren’t dealing with geniuses here. We are dealing with half pissed public servants”

Uni Communist Shows Off Che Guevara T-Shirt He Haggled With Peasants Over In 3rd World Country

TEXT:

A local University student who describes himself as a “total communist” has reportedly found an absolute ripper of a deal on a t-shirt with the face of Communist revolutionary, Che Guevara, at a small market in the 3rd world country he’s currently visiting to ‘find himself’ in.

Max LePont, 22, has spent the last month and a half travelling across South-East Asia, hoping to be inspired by his fellow communists while also satisfying his life-long passion for branded clothing.

“Honestly, it’s so amazing being in a true communist utopia”, said Mr. LePoint, upon returning from Cambodia. “Not only am I getting to learn about famous socialists who shaped the 20th century by taking a stand against rampant capitalism, they’ve got incredibly cool merch that you can buy really cheap!”

Mr. LePont’s latest, and perhaps greatest, find is a green t-shirt bearing the embossed head of infamous Argentinian Marxist and revolutionary, Che Guevara. Che Guevara was a man known for his almost fanatical hatred of the global capitalist order, a fact which Mr. LePont believes is perfectly encapsulated by this $3 t-shirt he found at a street stall in Phnom Phen.

“It really captures the essence of Che. I mean, just look at it. The windswept hair with the beret. That wry smile. Everything about him just screams ‘we need to seize the means of production!’”

“I think there is no better way to commemorate a man who hated capitalism so much than by printing an idealised version of his face onto child-labour-produced t-shirts and have millions of people around the world spend their money on them so they can tell all their friends how ‘with it’ and ‘liberal’ they are”

Mr. LePont is hopeful that this prized find is not the last treasure he discovers in his travels.

“I mean, there’s so much I’ve seen already! There’s this really cool calendar where all the months are October, to celebrate the October Revolution of 1917. You can buy a bunch of pre-cooked frozen microwave meals to commemorate the Great Chinese Famine of 1959. Hell, there’s even a cross with Jesus on it – although that one feels like they’re taking the piss a bit”

Patriot Proudly Defends Actions Of Ancestors While Also Distancing Himself From Them

TEXT:

A local UPF member has today declared that Aboriginal people should be thankful for white people did to them, while also stating that he can’t be held accountable for what white people did to them.

Kai Blottrell (32) a local car detailer who made heaps of coin during the Pink Batts fiasco, says that he doesn’t know much about his family tree given his estranged relationship with his father and general disinterest in his mother – but he presumes his family arrived in the First Fleet.

This wild guess at his family’s heritage makes him one of the most Australian people there is, and he won’t be made to feel ashamed about that.

However, as January 26th approaches, Kai is forced to confront the national dialogue currently surrounding the idea of celebrating the end of Indigenous sovereignty, and the unfair treatment of First Australians that followed his ancestor’s supposed arrival.

“I wasn’t there” he says.

“I had nothing to do with it. Why should I be made to feel bad about the atrocities they committed.”

However, while Kai grapples with the well-documented attempts at genocide and forced assimilation, he also can’t help but defend them.

“My ancestors didn’t steal Australia, they created it” he says, while contemplating whether or not he can continue with this new angle.

“And my family didn’t immigrate into an existing country, they built one – even if they still don’t have their own head of state and still answer to the Queen”

As Kai begins to lose his temper, the deep sadness inside his heart lifts slightly – which inevitably leads him to undermine every other coherent argument he has made throughout his entire tirade.

“They should be thankful” he says with a tear welling in his eyes, as he ponders on how long it has taken his dad to buy a packet of smokes.

Abbott Kindly Requests Media To Not Ask His Daughter For Her Thoughts On Australia Day

TEXT:

Former Prime Minister Tony Abbott has today requested that the media please do not undermine his politics by asking his youngest daughter, Frances, what she thinks about having the national holiday on January 26th.

In a throwback to the gay marriage postal vote, where Abbott’s own daughter campaigned against his wishes to never allow gay people the right to get married – Abbott has requested that the media just stop asking her for her compassionate millennial female opinions on issues that could be quite simply resolved with a slight gesture.

Today’s comments come as the former chaplaincy student appeared on 2GB talkback this morning to argue that the events of January 26, 1788, were a “good thing” for Aboriginal people.

Abbott defended his view that the controversial date — which marked the beginning of British settlement and kicked off a massacre of indigenous people — was the best date to mark Australia’s national day in a radio interview on Monday morning.

“What happened on the 26th of January, 1788, was on balance, for everyone, Aboriginal people included, a good thing,” Mr Abbott told 2GB host Ray Hadley.

“It brought Western civilisation to this country. It brought Australia into the modern world.”

“At least that’s what we all reckon at the surf club”

“But, please Ray. Please for the love of God don’t send anyone to Melbourne to ask Frances what her opinion on this all is. She’s been brainwashed by her gay aunt”

“It’ll undermine what we have here. The last bastion of Australian pride – telling Aboriginal people that we aren’t taking their feelings into account”

Bill Shorten Appeals To Youth Voters With Belated NekNominate Video

TEXT:

Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten has today made a bold attempt at winning over youth voters by posting his very first ‘NekNominate’ video – just 46 months after the brief viral trend rose to prominence.

It is not yet known which recent Melbourne University law graduate working as an advisor and confidante of the Labor-right identity was behind the idea, but it has caused collective groans right through his own party, and Australia as a whole.

The game became popular in early 2014, and as it spread it escalated, with nominees performing the challenge in more extreme circumstances, drinking more potent beverages or engaging in dangerous activities either during or immediately after consuming their beverage.

It was three years ago when Bill Shorten was was originally neknominated by Sam Dastyari, the Labor-right darling at the time but due to his newfound position as leader of the ALP, Shorten thought all that was needed to be elected was a squeaky brand. However in the post-truth populist political climate, this is no longer the case.

“I next nominate you Penny! [hahah]” said Shorten in a monotone voice that made him sound as though he was reading quite slowly from a teleprompter.

Neknominate, also known as neck and nominate, neknomination or neck nomination, is an online drinking game. The original rules of the game require the participants to film themselves drinking a pint of an alcoholic beverage, usually beer, in one gulp and upload the footage to the web. A participant then nominates another person to do the same, which has to be done within 24 hours.

It has been reported that Shorten latched onto this idea after seeing former Prime Minister Bob Hawke managing to remain relevant at the Sydney test last week, and demanded that his staffers find him a funny and relatable way to binge drink on camera.

His video, posted to Facebook last night has so far received 150 likes from mostly Labor staffers and friends of his wife.

Richmond Bloke Calls For Government To Deport African Gangs But Undeport Dusty’s Old Man

TEXT:

Although Royston Saxon says that while he doesn’t feel safe in his community anymore, he stills adamantly believes that a deported man with well known links to outlaw motorcycle gangs and a criminal record should be let back into the country.

“Come on, he’s Dusty’s dad for christ sake, he needs to be let back in” he told our reporters.

The Richmond-raised Saxon, who recently moved out to Dandenong after property prices surged and he cashed in, told us that he can’t take his family out for dinner anymore, citing gang violence as the primary concern.

“As soon as the sun goes down around here lock the doors fellas,” said Townsend, pretending like our reporters had just set foot in a Sao Paulo favella.

“I’m not racist but, these African gangs have completed ruined this community,” he said, looking out the window at a his favourite hotel, with 270 poker machines pinging through the suburban street.

We asked Townsend why he strongly held the belief that Shane Martin (who had his visa cancelled by the Immigration Minister for the aforementioned reasons) should be allowed to return to the country.

“Okay, okay, taking my Richmond hat of here for a second. The poor bloke, yes he was the leader of the Rebels and all that, but he missed his son win a Brownlow and Premiership, surely that’s punishment enough?” said Townsend.

Exhausted Woman Grinds Through Hostile Drinks With Two Alphas From Different Circles

TEXT:

A local girl has regrettably attempted to cross streams between friendships circles tonight – ultimately having to duck and weave through a skirmish of passive-aggressive comments being fired by her two besties.

Jacqui had initially hoped that her childhood best friend, Liz, and her work best friend Carrie would get on like a house on fire.

Unfortunately for Jacqui, the only chance she has of these two alphas bonding with each other is if they are able to develop a friendship over their mutual respect for eachother’s nasty comments.

Liz begins the sparring with a completely out of line shot at Carrie’s fashion sense.

“Hey I like your top. It really reminds me of one I used to have in Uni. Oh my God Jacqui! Do you remember that top!” she says, quickly diverting from her cold-hearted jab, into a nostalgic but ultimately exclusive trip down memory lane with Jac.

“Yeah I do!” says Jacqui.

“Hey Liz you should tell Carrie about your new job with the hospital”

Carrie, who is also a medical professional, takes her chance – and owns it.

“Oh you work at the hospital, which one? The Royal or The Ladies?”

The room is filled with silence. Carrie doubles up…

“Ohh.. Are you in public? Oh cool. Are you a nurse?”

“I started as a nurse”

Jacqui goes to the toilet for ten minutes to play on her phone in a desperate attempt to get them to play nice.

Transition Back Into Work Mode Made Easier By Office Air Conditioning

TEXT:

Over are the lazy days of playing Battlefield on the couch wearing only underpants.

At least for Dennis Samuels they are.

The oppressive heat was getting to him this morning as he made his way to the Betoota MetroLine stop on the corner of Greenbow and Kent in Betoota Heights.

He wasn’t used to wearing a $29 business shirt in such conditions.

But as the Shire Council upgraded all MetroLine services to have air conditioning at the end of last year, the 36-year-old felt that relief was just moments away.

However, the entire light rail car was already full to bursting so little relief was had during the commute.

“I thought to myself, ‘Oh well, it’s just a few short weeks until there’s another public holiday,'” he said.

“It’ll take a bit to get to get back into the swing of things. Check which invoices haven’t been paid from last year, chase them up. Get my body clock back into work mode. It’ll get easier.”

But one thing that has made it easier is the presence of the office air conditioning, a luxury that he simply doesn’t have at home – much like everybody else in this scorched hell pit.

Samuels’ employer, Bell Potter Betoota, told The Advocate that their air conditioning is often seen as a ‘huge drawcard’ when attracting graduates.

But they refused to comment on whether they’d turn the heat up come winter time.

“We advise our employees to bring a jumper all year round.”

The New Year’s bash at a private residence was attended by many One Nation staff and representatives, including party Senate Whip Brian Burston, who says Robert’s drink of choice was not the only strange behaviour exhibited by the Indian born former senator.

“He finished off the last of my XXXX which was strange, but it was the way he looked at me afterward and made this sort of low grunting sound that seemed to come from deep within his chest that I didn’t like. I can honestly say I was scared.”

Party host and Queensland One Nation Leader, Steve Dickson, says his Buderim home is used to hosting a lively crowd but believes the limits were tested by Robert’s particular style of partying.

“When he wasn’t finishing off the last of peoples beer or champers he was acting rather odd. He walked around handing people individual Corn Flakes that had words like ‘anal’ and ‘discharge’ written on them and kept asking the DJ to stop the music to put a Joe Rogan podcast on.”

“Then, later on, he just bolted out from behind a corner yelling ‘RUN!’ We all thought the cops were coming so Rosa Lee Long quickly slammed all the coke she had in one go. Wasn’t even anyone there.”

Reports state that after helping himself to more unfinished drinks, Robert’s tried to force the entire party to play a game of Risk with him, grapple tackled a staffer he believed responsible for leaking his citizenship documents and insisted on yelling “Happy Batman” instead of “Happy New Year.”

Partygoers were unable to find Roberts between 1:02 and 2:15 am, until he was later found in the kitchen pantry playing Russian Roulette with David Oldfield and Robin Scott.

Later, it is reported Robert’s was asked to leave after trying to persuade Peter Georgiou to do a shot of bong water and calling him a ‘mussy-loving pussy’ when he refused.

“There weren’t even any bongs at the party so where he got the water from is beyond me.”

It is reported that after being asked to leave he was later found on the roof of a neighbouring home, yelling spoilers for Star Wars: The Last Jedi at exiting partygoers, citing he was allowed to do so ‘because of free speech.’

Roberts himself is yet to comment on his behaviour but his employer Pauline Hanson has some theories.

“I think being unemployed has really fucked with him. He keeps editing his Wikipedia page and is still really upset he’s never been invited to speak on Q&A again.”

“I think it’s a combination of those things and the likelihood that whatever David Ettridge was drinking gave him a bit more than he bargained for.”

Barnaby Praised For Extra Cautious Sun Safety At Mooloolaba With Beach Akubra

TEXT:

Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce has been praised by advocates of sun safety this year for his oversized ‘beach akubra’ at Mooloolaba.

After a health scare with sunspots earlier in the year, the member for New England has made a point of covering his fair Kiwi skin with a long sleeved work shirt and a sombrero style cane hat, a type of headwear popular with regional Australians on holiday in the Sunshine Coast.

“Fuck me she’s a hot one” says the leader of the National party.

“Can’t be too bloody careful nowadays”

This report comes days after several other Barnaby-related stories in the Mooloolaba region.

On the 23rd he was spotted berating a South American backpacker for using ‘Havana’ rum when mixing a sugarcane champagne with cola at the Mooloolaba surf club.

The Deputy PM was reportedly ropeable that his rum and coke was made without the Bundaberg branded dark spirit.

On the 24th, he was seen yelling at the teenage deli staff at Mooloolaba Coles for running out of tartare sauce to have with his prawns.

After a big year of controversy, it remains unclear if the regional politician is actually managing to unwind this Christmas.

More to come.

Barnaby Berates Teenagers Working At Mooloolaba Coles For Running Out Of Tartare Sauce

TEXT:

Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce is reportedly ‘spewing’ today after being informed that there is no tartare sauce left in Mooloolba, by the nervous teenagers holding holiday management roles.

“Fuck me” he said.

“Can’t a man unwind”

Mr Joyce was quite controlled while telling the 16-year-old deli supervisor that he’s got about eight kilos of fresh Sunshine coast prawns that he needs to get through between now and New Years.

Earlier this month it was reported that the 50-year-old Tamworth man had been unable to pay attention during  Parliament question time because he was so caught up day dreaming about prawns over Christmas – but those excited holiday plans appear to be soiled, as his number one accompaniment for crustaceans is believed to be unavailable in Mooloolaba.

“Do you at least have some bloody one thousands islands”

“What am I supposed to dip these things in. They are monsters… I need a dip”

With the terrified staff members at Coles checkout currently on the phones to nearby Coles and the packing room, the Deputy Prime Minister says he’s in half a mind to buy some tomato sauce and mix it with some mayo.

“Don’t make me do the T Sauce prawns again like we used to do in Dirranbandi.” he says.

“C’mon are you sure there isn’t any out the back”

“You Were The Chosen One!” Screams Bill Shorten Before Leaving Sam Dastyari To Die In The Firey Pit Of Trade Unionism

TEXT:

Earlier yesterday, the Opposition Leader rang one of his backbench senators and told him not to come to work next year.

Shortly after, Bill Shorten and departing senator Sam Dastyari fought hand-to-hand and room-to-room over the Sydneysider’s future in politics.

Initially, only punches and slaps were traded, until maverick MP Bob Katter threw them both a sword, which he kept behind the desk in his office for occasions such as this – and the fighting escalated.

Security quickly threw them out and onto the street where they continued their running skirmish.

The pair spilt out onto the streets of Barton, in Canberra’s cosmopolitan pointless museum district.

“It’s over Dasher, I have the high ground!” said Bill.

“You underestimate my power! I have the Chinese Communist Party on side!” yelled Sam.

“Don’t try it!”

The Victorian ultimately defeated Dastyari, cutting his legs off and one hand using Robbie Katter’s double-handed Celtic sword he was gifted from Mel Gibson.

As Sam lay there, writhing in his own self-inflicted agony, Bill stood over him and watched him slowly burn to death outside the offices of Hawker-Britton.

“You were the chosen one! It was said that you would destroy the communists, not join them! Bring balance to Labor… not leave it in darkness!” Shorten yelled.

“I hate you!” Sam gurgled in reply.

“You were my brother, Dasher! I loved you!”

Shorten then turned and left, returning to parliament in his Trabant comcar.

Moments later, some minders from Hawker-Britton slithered out through the door and retried Sam before he bled to death in the Kim Beazley Snr Memorial Smoking Area.

Mid-Afternoon Kayak Fails To Cheer Malcolm Turnbull Up After Q&A Train-Wreck

TEXT:

Many times in the past, a quick scoot around Sydney Harbour’s Shark Island from his Point Piper home is enough to put the breath back in his trumpet – not today.

Malcolm Turnbull appeared on popular ABC witch-hunting programme, Q&A, last night and not everything went to plan according to many media commentators.

The sentiments of those particular commentators were echoed this afternoon as the Prime Minister was spotted kayaking, as he loves doing, away from his private wharf and out onto the harbour with a scowl on his face.

Just over an hour later, he returned looking just as displeased.

He dragged his late-model Boréal up into the boatshed and begun rinsing the seawater off.

Speaking to The Advocate via mobile telephone, the former barrister spoke of how he was feeling regarding last night.

“What else do they want from me?” he said softly to himself.

“All this NBN business. For fuck’s sake it’s summer, get off the internet and enjoy the outdoors for Christ’s sake! Your fucking goblins and warcuff [sic] elves will be there when you get back. I promised to get gay marriage over the line, I do it and no cunt at the ABC would even give me a cheer last night,”

“Fuck me, right? And another thing! I’d be loving this Labor-China shit a lot more if it wasn’t for last night. It really took the Kerry out of my Packer, it did. Don’t get me started on last night, child. I could go on for hours.”

When asked what else he had planned for today, he said nothing and hung up.

Shorten Forced To Explain His Mandarin Tattoo Not Associated With Political Donations

TEXT:

Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten MP has today had to clarify that the mandarin tattoo running down his neck has nothing to do with the Labor parties newly revealed links to the Chinese Government.

“It was a mid-life crisis brain snap” said Shorten.

“Not the political donations stuff, the tattoo”

“I believe it says Golden Boy, in Mandarin, I had it inscribed down my back during the second Rudd ministry… When things started looking good for me”

After being spotted taking a swim at St Kilda beach yesterday, Shorten’s Mandarin tattoo raised immediate questions about the minister’s ties to the Chinese Government, particularly after the news that Chinese billionaire Huang Xiangmo paid $55,000 to have lunch with Bill Shorten in October 2015.

The revelation comes as Mr Shorten faces pressure to expel senator Sam Dastyari from the Labor Party over his links to Mr Huang, who intelligence agencies warn is closely linked to the Chinese Government.

Mr Huang attended the function organised by a Labor fundraising arm with Mr Shorten in Sydney on October 5, in the midst of a heated political debate about Labor’s opposition to the China-Australia trade deal.

Mr Shorten says the tattoo has nothing to do with party policy, or Senator Dastyari, but is more about his love of oriental culture ‘in general’ – and a need to express himself after turning 40.

“It’s just a massive coincidence that all this stuff has been revealed at the same time”

“I literally had no idea about Dasher, or that a controversial Chinese billionaire with ties to the Chinese Government had attended a low key lunch in Sydney with me a couple months back”

Report: Dastyari In Some Curry

TEXT:

A recent report by anyone who has been reading the news has found that Labor senator and walking headline Sam Dastyari really couldn”t have landed himself in more shit if he tried.

This comes after a report in Fairfax Media that suggests he urged Labor’s deputy Tanya Plibersek not to meet pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong.

“Oh fuck” said Shorten.

“Just when I thought all eyes were on Malcolm. Gotdam it Sam”

The report is the latest in a string of allegations around Dasher’s links with Chinese donors, which recently saw him demoted from leadership positions in the Labor party.

Labor’s health spokeswoman Catherine King said Senator Dastyari should consider throwing in the towel, that’s if he cares about the fucking Labor party, which no one really does unless they are the leader of it.

“We have been very, very clear about the matter of Sam Dastyari, that his political career is, in essence, going nowhere,” she said, referring to Labor leader Bill Shorten twice dumping the senator from senior jobs.”

“I feel like slapping the bloke in the face, like ease up dickhead. What the hell is all this China shit”

Gay Marriage Bill Expected To Pass After Coalition Officially Use Up Both Their Reviews

TEXT:

Same-Sex marriage opponents were dealt a huge blow this afternoon, after it was confirmed that they’ve used up all of their reviews and won’t get any more to fight the passing of the bill.

Coalition captain Tony Abbott had displayed some truly frivolous reviewing over the course of the debate, and matters came to a head today as yet another attempt to make ‘freedom of religion’ amendments to the SSM bill were overturned by Third Umpire Marias Erasmus.

At the close of play, it was confirmed that due to his inability to judge the trajectory of an entire nation, the Coalition can no longer call into question the decisions of their peers to finally enact same-sex marriage in Australia.

Abbott, who has long been a proponent of the DRS (Dickhead Revisionist System) throughout his career, was said to be furious at the turn of events, and even tried to complain to the Match Referee, Queen Elizabeth. However, his attempts were futile, as the Queen was pre-occupied trying to teach Prince Phillip not to make any black jokes in front of their new granddaughter-in-law.

Abbott’s woes were further worsened by the unceremonious mocking he received at the hands of his Barmy Army, who have long been at the forefront of the LGBT fight.

The captain was unreachable for comment.

NSW Premier Considers Pulling Down Opera House And Making It A Bit Bigger For No Reason

TEXT:

Gladys Berejiklian has reportedly spent some time sniffing around the Opera House this morning, looking for somewhere else to piss away billions of dollars.

Other members within the party have revealed to The Advocate today that the Premier is not content with spending just $2 billion demolishing and rebuilding the two major football stadiums in Sydney, so is looking for other fully functional public assets to pour cash into

A senior cabinet member who wished to remain off the record told us that Berejiklian has been eyeing off one of the most expensive public buildings in Australian history, and has already reached out to contractors to see how much bigger she can make it.

“I’m all for lining pockets with developers and construction companies money, but shit like this costs us elections and makes it awfully hard to keep our jobs,” the insider said.

“Like I don’t even know how she has sold it so far. ANZ stadium was built like 17 years ago. If she wanted to get some political points to go with it she should have just said there will be more trains running so people don’t have to herd like cattle for hours to get home after a game.”

Political commentators have blasted the decision to rebuild the stadiums citing a whole raft of areas far more deserving of taxpayer money like schools, hospitals and grass roots funding for sports.

Stuart from Penrith spoke to The Betoota Advocate today, he says it’s great and all and maybe a few people will go to some more games, but pointed out that his kids go to the local public school which is essentailly a tent army og demountables and he reckons Gladys could probably spend that coin slightly better.

Katter Welcomes Banking Royal Commission But He Ain’t Spending Anymore Time On It Because, In The Meantime, Every Three Months, A Person Is Torn To Pieces By A Crocodile In North Queensland

TEXT:

Maverick North Queensland MP The Honourable Bob Katter III has today commended the Turnbull Government for ‘growing a set’ and announcing a royal commission into the banking sector, after Australia’s big four banks wrote to the Treasurer asking for an inquiry to restore public faith in the financial system.

Turnbull fronted media today alongside Scott Morrison MP to declare that he will be receiving a lot less Christmas cards this year.

“Since the financial crisis, there have been examples of misconduct by financial institutions. Some of them extremely serious. And that’s demanded a response from the institutions themselves and from government,” said Mr Turnbull.

“ANZ, Commonwealth, NAB and Westpac – all eyes on you, motherfuckers”

“Those who need to get got, will get got”

However, Katter, who has been one of the most vocal supporters of banking royal commission has already turned his attention to the next biggest issue facing his electorate.

“Our farmers have had their backs to the wall as a result of stand over tactics from these bastards in Martin Place” he said.

“It’s about bloody time. I commend Turnbull and his cronies for making this decision, may a thousand banking executives go to prison, but I ain’t spending anymore time on it, because in the meantime, every three months, a person is torn to pieces by crocodile in North Queensland”

Turnbull is yet to comment on whether or not he would entertain a Royal Commission into why every three months a person is torn to pieces by a crocodile in North Queensland.

One Nation Staff Change Channels To Albion Greyhounds Halfway Through Election Coverage

TEXT:

It is believed the minds behind the unsuccessful Queensland state election campaign were quick to change channels after realising that their party wasn’t going to win one seat over the weekend.

Hanson and her followers spent the election day at Buderim on Queensland’s Sunshine Coast – not an area that would be readily associated with hardcore Xenophobia and political populism, but more linen shirts and Reds Rugby scarves.

That is, except for their party leader Steve Dickson, a former frontbench MP with the Liberal National Party who defected to Hanson in a poor career move – after wrongly assuming he would win back his seat as a high-ranking member of One Nation.

Hanson and Dickson were surrounded by campaign staff for most of the day, most of whom discreetly donate money to online neo-nazi organisations and have a history of torturing animals during their childhood.

After an entire day of dismissing poll results and early estimations, as well as comparing themselves to Donald Trump and blaming the media for the increasingly unexciting election updates, the devastated staffers decided to take their mind off the Queensland voters horrific response to their tax frauds and online conspiracists that were put forward as candidates.

The entire room at the Buderim garage party became fixated on the results of a greyhound race broadcasted live from Albion Park, as the party staffers pointed out that they had all loaded up on a 3-year-old named ‘White Australia’.

“Come on you bastard!” shouted the now unemployed state leader, Steve Dickson.

“At least give me this you fucking mutt!”

“Come on White Australia, get your fucking nose in there!”

Malcolm Roberts Returns To Former Job Of Denying Climate Change In A Sandwich Board

Former senator-turned-state-political-hopeful Malcolm Roberts has returned to his former role with the Galileo Movement, after being defeated in the Queensland election over the weekend.

The One Nation candidate was hoping to win the Ipswich electorate at Saturday’s state election just weeks are being parachuted in at the eleventh hour – but ultimately fell short of his goal.

Now with his political life seemingly behind him, the Indian-born political activist has taken up his old post on the roadside, where he denies climate change in a sandwich board.

The Advocate caught up with Roberts this morning outside Roma Street station in Central Brisbane.

“I also hand out literature for people to read regarding the subject,” said Roberts.

“Unless you’ve seen the error of your ways. Then please let me explain how Russia is using microwave ovens in our homes to control our thoughts and push their leftist agenda on us.”

“China is also spying on us, they planted a listening device in a pair of my shoes once. I had to throw them out. Here, take this literature, it’s got some helpful links in it.”

QLD VOTES: Nation Wonders If Queensland Will Validate One Nation’s Existence

TEXT:

As millions of Queenslanders head to the polls today, the rest of the nation looks on with wonder and anticipation.

Often a great litmus test for the country’s political sentiments as a whole, the election is the first since controversial paramilitary organisation, One Nation, won a number of Federal Senate seats last year.

Which is why the question on everyone’s lips is will Queensland validate the existence of Pauline Hanson by voting her into even more power – or let her and her party evaporate into the annals of history?

Local businesswoman, Justine Greer, spoke to The Advocate just minutes after casting her vote at South Betoota Public School this afternoon.

“I hate everyone and everything to do with politics so I wrote a swear word on the ballot paper and put in through the slot,” she said.

“Fuck the southeast and fuck the reef, it’s already dead. Build us a new hospital, now!”

Another voter said One Nation didn’ stand a chance because Queensland doesn’t have an upper house.

“That’s where you find all the lunatics, in the upper house,” said local farmer Walter Greencoat.

“Here in Queensland, we shitcanned that idea a long time ago. Just look at other states. You’ve got that gibbering old cunt Fred Nile still poking about down in Mexico. Abolish state government, it’s the only way forward! Australia not for sale! Australia not for sale!”

After speaking to a number of voters, there was no clear consensus of who is voting for One Nation, which is alarming to many local electoral pundits.

The voting continues.

PM Demands Kiwis And PNG Stop Conspiring To Solve Humanitarian Crisis Behind His Back

TEXT:

Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has come out today and demanded that the leaders of Australia’s closest neighbours stop meddling behind his back to solve the situation on Manus Island, and allow things to continue not happening.

“Just cut it out” he said.

“We’ve got this. It’s none of your business… A part from maybe you lot [Papua New Guinea]… This isn’t an international issue…”

“Just.. Umm.. Let’s just see how it goes”

According to the United Nations, the current situation on Manus Island is now well and truly a humanitarian crisis, which is described by the Oxford Dictionary as a singular event or a series of events that are threatening in terms of health, safety or well being of a community or large group of people.

Australia closed the Manus Island regional processing centre at the end of October as part of an agreement with the PNG government, spending $10m on an alternative reception centre in East Lorengau – a township that scares the shit out of them due to cultural clashes and intimidation from the locals.

As many as 380 refugees and asylum seekers have refused to leave the old centre, citing safety fears.

Immigration Minister Peter Dutton has also condemned New Zealand’s attempts at sorting out his fuck up.

“Just keep your wool-fleecing hands out of it!” said Dutton

“The last thing we want is a resolution that makes our country look empathetic, after everything that has happened over there. We can’t back down now – it would look weak”

This comes as twelve former Australians of the Year last night penned an open letter asking Mr Turnbull and Mr Shorten to immediately allow doctors access to asylum seekers in the facility.

The letter’s signatories include Australians of the Year Rosie Batty, Ita Buttrose, Simone McKeon, Patrick McGorry, Mick Dodson, Tim Flannery, Fiona Wood, Fiona Stanley, Gustav Nossal, Peter Doherty, John Yu and Robert de Castella – They warn Australia’s reputation on human rights is deteriorating because of the failure to meet the obligations of the UN Refugee Convention.

Turnbull says these kinds of petitions aren’t helpful either.

“Please don’t. You’ll make Peter angry. You don’t want to see him when he’s angry”

“We need to keep Peter off 2GB at all costs, just, let’s see if we can work together, huh?”

Brisbane Baby Boomer Confident In LNP’s Chances After Waving At Traffic For 4 Hours

An outspoken local and avid reader of the works of Murdoch, has come back to his gated community in The Gap today, confident he’s boosted his favourite parties numbers substantially.

The humble optimism came after Cooke pulled a two-hour stint on the corner of Waterworks and Settlement Roads this morning. In a solid effort, he waved to the neighbourhood’s peak hour commuters, who no doubt appreciated the sentiment.

As tensions rise in QLD’s political landscape, Cooke grabbed his camping chair and busted out a spiffy new A-frame, perching himself right amongst the action, in a brave and noble effort.

His decision to hit the front-line came as concerns about the “PC Brigade” began to rise amongst his Sunday men’s cycling group during their post-ride coffee.

“This bloody PC brigade” said Cooke, “I don’t like the bloody PC brigade. Those PC brigader people. PC brigade. Don’t like em at all.”

Not getting much else out of Cooke, we approached other members of his cycling club at their favourite coffee spot. Cooke’s mate, Phillip Collins, echoed his concerns somewhat.

“This bloody PC brigade, they’re making us uncomfortable” he said, adjusting his penis and testicles inside his imperative cycling suit.

“We’ve avoided all these silly little issues our whole lives. Where not gonna start letting them bother us now”

“This bloody PC brigade. It’s getting on our nerves and we really should feel comfortable in our own state”. He then asked “are you reading that?” before running off into a corner with the Courier Mail.

Malcolm Turnbull Steps Out In His Favourite AC⚡DC T-Shirt

TEXT:

Laughing off the suggestion that he’s completely and utterly detached from modern Australian society, the Prime Minister was spotted at a local beach in his electorate wearing his favourite AC⚡DC t-shirt.

Telling following journalists that he ‘simply had a brain fart’ yesterday on Triple M Brisbane where he was unable to name a single Acca Dacca track, Malcolm Turnbull said he knows plenty.

“I have a penchant for their For Those About To Rock album, I regard it to be one of the finest pop-rock records of all time,” he said.

“Today I’ve also chosen to wear my favourite AC⚡DC shirt in memory of Malcolm Young, who I understand recently passed from some sort of ghastly ailment. Terrible business, that. Anyway, Vale Malcolm and I send my condolences to his family and friends,”

“I trust you’ve got enough to write your articles and produce your news packages. Yes? OK. Fuck off now, I’m going for a swim. I’ll see you all in a few weeks.”

However, a number of music pundits have concluded that the PM was wearing a Metallica t-shirt.

Speaking on-the-record to The Advocate, local record store owner, Poncho Dickman, said that ‘he wasn’t surprised’ with the gaffe and talking about only makes him die a little more on the inside.

From the counter of his Old City District music shop, Dickman said the Prime Minister needs an education in classic rock and he needs it now.

“Come to think of it, why should he even bother,” he conceded.

“I mean, the bloke clearly doesn’t like rock music. He’s probably into some creepy shit like chamber baroque or something perverted like that. I’m not about to ram T-Rex down his throat, just like I don’t expect him to ram Bach down mine,”

“If he said he like Metallica more than AC⚡DC, it probably would’ve gone a bit better for him. At least he’s not a self-described ‘ABBA Man’ like Christopher Pyne is.”

QLD: One Nation Only Party Listening To Working Class Pleas To Be Paid Less On Weekends

TEXT:

As the Queensland election enters it’s final lap, Pauline Hanson has today announced that One Nation is the only party taking the time to listen to the wants and needs of the working class – and how thankful they are to have their penalty rates taken from them.

One headline that has been greatly overshadowed by citizenship drama and postal votes, is that earlier this year the Senate passed legislation to cut more than $1 billion in welfare funding, including support for single-income families.

One Nation leader Pauline Hanson, who was immediately singled out for blindly joining the Liberal Party in a decision that looks to impact hundreds of thousands of Australians in vulnerable positions, was quick to deflect attention from her involvement in the scrapping of penalty rates.

When asked if her decision to scrap penalty rates was, in fact, not a good thing for working Australians, Hanson responded by saying that she believes it is the first step towards banning Muslims from Australia.

“Ummmm… No, I don’t think it’s a bad thing” she said, attempting to justify both her promises to the terrified working class and the billionaire political donors that funded her entire campaign.

“You, see… These muslims. A lot of them are working in jobs that Australians wouldn’t work in”

“Which um, means that, a lot of them are on penalty rates”

“I think scrapping penalty rates is a good way of stopping these people from sending money to their family overseas and bringing them here”

After several minutes of bumbling, Hanson utilised the message that she realised she was trying to make.

“Scrapping penalty rates is the first step towards a Muslim ban!”

As One Nation ramps up it’s campaign for the upcoming QLD election, the leader of the party says she believes Queensland’s ‘battlers’ agree with her when it comes to slashing their own wages.

“It’s what they want. They are sick of all of this political correctness that allows them to be paid extra for their family time. We are the only ones listening to their pleas”

Internet phenomenon and celebrity goat ‘Gary’ passed away earlier this week, triggering an outpouring og grief around the world.

Unlike the April Fool’s joke last year, the animal actually died aged 6 on Thursday night via euthanasia after vets diagnosed a bleed from an acute heart tumour.

As Gary was arguably the most famous Australian animal, the Prime Minister has offered a state funeral to the family of Gary.

“Mr Speaker, I’d like to pause for a moment to reflect on the life of Gary the Goat and his service to the Australian people,” said Turnbull.

“The offer of a State Funeral has been extended to the family,”

More will be known at a later date. For now, we remember Gary.”

Opposition leader Bill Shorten simply shrugged and looked over at his deputy Tanya Plibersek, who also shrugged and seconded the motion.

However, our reporters observed Mr Turnbull take his seat in the House and look up the ceiling, letting out a small laugh.

Gang Of Youths Frontman David Le’aupepe Receives Late Call Up To Samoan World Cup Side

Media at Darwin airport today is abuzz with an unexpected arrival, as the lead singer of Sydney-based Alt-Rock band Gang Of Youths was seen wearing full Toa Samoa squad clothing and Beats headphones.

David Le’aupepe was spotted alongside other members of the Samoan national side, confirming rumours that the rum-swilling rockstar has thrown the boots back on.

“Fuckkk, he’s looking pretty good” said one Virgin hostess from their flight.

“He must have been in training, he’s really bulked up”

It is believed that Le’aupepe will be replacing Melbourne Storm fullback, Young Tonumaipea, after questions arose surrounding the rising star’s eligibility following revelations that his first name is actually a nickname that has been appropriated from Yee-Huang – the 7th most common first name in mainland China.

Le’aupepe, who’s father is Samoan, says he always knew this day would come, but was waiting for

“I didn’t think I would be more eligible than someone born in Apia” Le’aupepe told the media.

“But I guess the stats from my juniors still stand, there was a point in my life where I could have really pick up either a guitar or a Steeden”

“Obviously, I chose music, but it is great to get a chance to trot around again. Toa Samoa!”

“I always remember what my u12s coach told in Strathfield as a kid. They can’t run without heads. Billy Slater, I’m looking at you”

Samoa have one more chance heading into this match after two losses and a draw in their earlier pool clashes.

The side has already been listed as the tournament’s biggest disappointments – the side must now take to Darwin with momentum to prove that they deserve to be in the finals.

Fleeing with just the clothes on their backs, a number of no-voting Warringah seniors only had a matter of minutes to escape the gay which has seemingly won the hearts of 75% of their fellow residents.

Gwendolyn Jackson, 69, said she heard the news echo throughout her Davidson home from the AM radio in the kitchen shortly after 10 am this morning.

It sent a chill down her spine.

“I grabbed a cardigan and hit the road,” she said.

“Didn’t even have time to run back into the bedroom to get my car keys. My husband Brett and I ran all the way here to Epping from the Northern Beaches. It’s safe here in the electorate of Bennelong. We can breathe again,”

“But it was horrible. Both of us got this overwhelming sense of impending doom as they [702 ABC Sydney] said here in Warringah three-quarters of people voted in favour of same-sex marriage. We didn’t feel safe in our own home, we had to get out.”

Mr and Mrs Jackson weren’t the only elderly Warringah residents putting a few clicks on their all-white New Balance sneakers this morning.

Local authorities say they counted upwards of sixty ageing couples making the dash west to Bennelong with a steady stream of Christians behind them.

Police have advised that the gay poses no health risks to greying heterosexual people and couples and that short of staying put in their homes, they advise those feeling threatened by the Yes result to speak to their neighbours and family about it.

Turnbull Tells Abbott This Is The Last Time Australia Will Blow $122M On Stroking His Ego

TEXT:

Malcolm Turnbull has taken the time out of his busy day to catch up with arch-nemesis and his predecessor, Former Prime Minister Tony Abbott.

It is believed that aside from rubbing int today’s same-sex marriage survey results, Turnbull has made a point of telling Tony Abbott that the Coalition government will never again spend that much money in an attempt to appease his religiously-charged detachment from the Australian public.

“I just want you to know, dickhead, that this was all your fault”

“We could have built two brand new hospitals with that money. But no, you needed an official statistic on how wrong you were”

“Pull your fucking head in. If Shorten wins this next election, it will only be because of your hero-worship for George Pell”

As confirmed this morning by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the people of Australia have voted in favour of changing the law to allow same-sex marriage.

Australian Statistician David Kalisch announced the results of the ABS postal survey from Canberra, confirming the survey had delivered a Yes result. Of 12.7 million votes, 61 per cent were returned in favour of same-sex marriage.

The final participation rate accounted for 79.5 per cent of eligible voters, most of whom decided that gays can get married and who gives a fuck.

Tony Abbott is believed to be now working towards creating a nest of hyper-political red tape to prevent the marriage act from being changed before the next election – but it is believed his ego has been wounded by the overwhelming pro-SSM survey response from his own electorate.

Local Young Liberals Chapter Concede They May Have Slightly Misread This One

TEXT:

Though he’d tell himself he could bat a bit, Courtney Walsh would often walk out into the middle, misread the first ball and be on his way back to the pavilion all within a few minutes.

A number of local Young Liberals explained to The Advocate that they’re feeling the same right now.

“We didn’t really expect this, to be honest,” said Gracey Henry, president of the South Betoota Association of Young Liberal Nationals.

“Though Maranoa voted No on the whole, the wider Betoota community obviously voted Yes as we saw this morning. Frankly, I don’t know how to feel about this. We were all so confident we represented to feeling of the majority of local young people,”

“Turns out we misread this one. I think we are now in danger of being on the wrong side of history. Jesus, there are photos of me a No rallies on the internet. We even had a book-burning one night. I wonder if this will negatively affect me in the future?”

Echoing young Gracey’s sentiments was Angus Ponsford, a mildly popular former school prefect who campaigned heavily for same-sex marriage to remain a socialist pipedream.

He told our reporters that he feels threatened.

“I don’t feel comfortable speaking my mind in public anymore,” said the 29-year-old.

“Or privately for that matter. My speech is no longer free. I feel marginalised and unheard. This is simply not fair. I thought their campaign was for equality,”

“Please leave our meeting, please. Our parents are coming to pick us up.”

City Of Sydney Passes Away Peacefully Hours After Naming New Ferry ‘Ferry McFerryface’

TEXT:

The nation is in mourning after its largest and most populous city passed away this afternoon surrounded by family and friends.

Announced via a family spokesman, the news comes as a shock to many as the city showed signs of recovery after the controversial lockout laws almost claimed its life in 2014.

However, it seems the life was once again sucked out of it after naming a new ferry after a popular 2016 meme.

The Prime Minister addressed the passing of his hometown during Question Time in Canberra just a short time ago.

“Over two hundred years of trials and tribulations have failed to mortally wound Sydney. From the earliest years of the colony, right up to the controversial lockout laws. Nothing has been able to kill our first city,” said Malcolm Turnbull.

“Until now. It seems naming a new ferry ‘Ferry McFerryface’ epitomises everything that is wrong with Sydney, which ultimately proved to be the straw that broke the Port Jackson shark’s back,”

“Vale Sydney, you will be missed by all except those who hated you. Which is everyone that’s visited you in recent years. May you finally be at peace.”

A requiem mass for the city will be held in each major capital city later this week. Check local newspapers for the venue and time.

Lambie Says High Court Decision May Take Her Job But It Will Never Take Her Freedom

TEXT:

As the Australian Federal Government faces it’s most dramatic constitutional crisis since we somehow managed to lose a sitting Prime Minister at sea, whispers are bouncing around the halls of Parliament House as public servants who would never be able to find a six figure salary in any other job, desperately dob each other in for having wog parents.

Another senator that looks like she will fall victim to the ongoing citizenship crisis within 24 hours, with Tasmanian independent Jacqui Lambie awaiting urgent advice from British authorities as to whether she is a dual citizen.

This means there is a possibility of a complete stranger with absolutely zero experience as a politician stepping in to replace Lambie in the Australian upper house.

Senator Lambie has she had sought urgent advice last week as to whether she holds dual citizenship, and said she will resign from the Senate immediately if that is confirmed.

Speaking to the Betoota Advocate this afternoon, Senator Lambie was more than nonplussed about this particular issue.

“Oh for fuck’s sake” she roared.

“How the fuck was I supposed to know”

As Lambie’s recently acknowledged Scottish blood boils, she stormed from her office in full Mel Gibson face paint.

“You know what, I’m sick of all of these High Courts toffs taking Aussie jobs from hard working Aussie politicians”

The iconic lino-floor feminist offered some words of advice to her fellow pollies facing the same issues.

“Aye” she yelled in a broad Tasmanian accent.

“Fight and you may get the sack. Run and you’ll get a job on the board of a massive corporation — at least a while. And dying in your beds many years from now, would you be willing to trade all the days from this day to that for one chance to sit on $200k a year to abuse people in the senate”

“Just one chance to come back here and tell the high court that they may take our jobs but they’ll never take our freedom!”

Barnaby In Stable Condition After Giving Away ‘Stranger Things’ Spoiler In Tamworth Pub

TEXT:

Barnaby Joyce is icing his face today following a violent incident that allegedly started over a discussion about season 2 of Stranger Things that was not prefaced with a spoiler alert.

Two Tamworth locals have been taken into police custody and charged with aggravated assault. Witnesses claim the altercation started when the victim began describing the problems he had with the ending of Stranger Things 2.

“He just started talking about how we wished that [redacted] had more screen time and next thing you know his mates were just on top of him, punching him in his mouth to get him to shut up.”

Legal representatives of the perpetrators state their client’s actions were not malicious but done out of self-defence.

“Our client was only up to episode three of Stranger Things 2 and did not want to hear about the alleged shortcomings of the following episodes. Furthermore, we will be counter-suing for damages to awe-factor they would have otherwise experienced without the knowledge that episode seven is allegedly ‘skippable.’”

Speaking exclusively with The Advocate from the Tamworth sauna, Joyce said that he wasn’t going to spoil everything and mentioned that if the perpetrators really cared about what happened they would have finished it by now.

“It’s all available now, just binge it into the early hours of the morning like a normal person!”

“I wasn’t telling them everything that happened, I just wanted to mention that it was really charming when Dustin and Steve Harrington-”

Our interview was cut short when Joyce’s masseuse twisted his nipple as he was making this statement.

“Had to do it just at that moment. Plus I’m still on season one. No spoiler alert again. When will this guy learn?

Barnaby Joyce Finally Takes Own Advice And Seeks Job In Regional Area

TEXT:

The people of North-West New South Wales are once again being reminded that Barnaby Joyce is actually from the back-hills of Tamworth, as the man recently stood-down from the role of Deputy Prime Minister.

After years of criticising Sydney and Melbourne workers for complaining about house prices, Mr Joyce has in turn, taken his own advice and moved to the New England, where he is looking for work as a public servant.

Earlier this year, the by-election hopeful  suggested Australians who are opting for “incredibly expensive” homes because they want to live within 100 kilometres of a central business district, and to work in careers that can only be sustained by living within 100 kilometres of a central business district.

The Nationals leader told ABC RN Drive that those who cannot afford a home in Sydney or Melbourne should consider moving to much shitter areas, where it is cheaper to buy property.

Mr Joyce made his provocative comments after being questioned about a new survey which rates Sydney’s housing as less affordable than New York or London and whether the Government was doing enough to address the issue.

“The thing is, if you want to live in Sydney as a first home buyer – you need to be rocking two $100,000 plus incomes”

“So technically, you can only be a first home buyer in Sydney if you married with no kids and on a wage higher than majority of Australians under 35 are on”

The fromer Minister For Agriculture went on to point out that living in the city is simply unsustainable for young people, unless someone does something about the fact that the average wages for people under 35 have only increased 3% in the last 30 years – and need to be scaled accordingly Australians over 50 enjoy an averaged wage increase of over 30%, which isn’t going to happen.

“Entering the housing market is easy. Just give up on having a job in finance, media, law, town planning, state services or anything else that would require you to be in a city”

“There’s plenty of rehab and counselling jobs going in Bourke right now, why would anyone be wanting to work as a nurse or paramedic in Sydney right now”

Joyce has advised young Australians to pick between working in education, agribusiness or mining – that’s if they want to own a home and be able to get to work in under 2 hours each day.

“We’ve got plenty of jobs in Boggabilla, plenty in Wilcannia. Why does everyone feel the need to live in metropolitan areas with more than four types of occupations”

“Our state governments have made it clear that they aren’t interesting in stemming the flow of overseas investors into our cities vacant apartment buildings, so this is your only option”

“Please don’t stop eating smashed avocado, though. Avocado farmers are some of my safest constituents”

It is not yet known who will be running against Joyce, and if they would even stand a chance, but locals say it has been good to see him floating around again.

Patriots Abusing Sam Dastyari Insist They Aren’t Those Racist Patriots You’ve Read About

TEXT:

Iranian-born Labor senator Sam Dastyari was approached by a group of patriots in a Melbourne pub last night who then decided to film themselves hurling racially-charged insults at the politician.

Through the three minute video, the patriots in question repeatedly tell Mr Dastyari to ‘go home to Iran’ while the practising socialist repeatedly explains that he doesn’t have time for ‘UPF racists’.

However, many of the patriots in the video have expressed their anger at being labelled racists and for being lumped in the United Patriots Front – they’re from another completely different group called ‘Patriot Blue’.

The Advocate spoke to a gentleman claiming to represent the group a short time ago after he kicked the door in at our Melbourne bureau we share with Launceston’s tabloid daily, The Examiner.

“We are not racist patriots like the UPF, we are just patriots,” said one Patriot Blue spokesman, who asked to remain anonymous as ‘it would cost him his job if his boss knew he was a patriot’.

“Mate, watch the video and then tell me we’re racist. We’re an anti-grub organisation. That Shane Dastyari is a grub. He took Chinese money and continues to take taxpayer money. Resignation now!”

He then spat on the floor and rubbed it into the carpet with his Mack Truck branded boot.

“Anyway, fuck you cunts, I’m outta here.”

Moments after storming out of our Ascot Vale Rd hot desk space, the man, who we can identify as Michael Sock of Bendigo, threw a rock at a passing bus before running off down Puckle St.

The Advocate reached out to Mr Dastyari’s office for comment and received a prompt reply.

“Yeah guys, they were racist patriots,” said Dastyari.

One Nation Considers Changing Party Name After News Of Hanson’s Possible Dual-Citizenship

TEXT:

The latest casualty of the Dual-Citzenship saga embroiling the federal Government, Paul Hanson has today confirmed she has trade marked and registered the brand Two Nations.

In a move set to divide the nation Senator Hanson said because she had duel citizenship she didn’t that retaining the name One Nation actually reflected the true spirit.

“We are one, but we are many, from Britain and Australia I come,” Senator Hanson sang to a packed media scrum in weird rendition of the Seekers famous Ballard “I Am Australian”.

This comes as Pauline Hanson says she will check with the British Home Office to ensure she’s not a dual citizen.

A day after she stressed she had no reason to worry about being caught in the parliamentary citizenship crisis, the One Nation leader has decided she better double check.

“Well you never know” she said.

“If Malcolm Roberts got done, I could easily get done. He’s one of the smartest blokes I know”

Senator Hanson reportedly told Woman’s Day magazine in February 2010 she was relocating to Britain where she could hold dual citizenship.

The recently unearthed interview sparked speculation on Tuesday about the party leader amid the ongoing citizenship scandal engulfing federal politics – marking the first moment in print history where Woman’s Day has been praised for their journalism.

When queried about the possible name change, Hanson said after the debacle with former Senator Roberts, she thinks it’s time for her anti-immigration party to focus on the two countries that most of their prominent leaders seem to hold citizenship with.

Late this afternoon, the Prime Minister was seen standing like Liam Gallagher does when he sings at the end of a Sydney jetty as he looked toward the sky.

“Why God,” said Malcolm Turnbull.

“Why have you done this to me? What have I done to deserve this shabby treatment? I’ve ticked all the boxes. I don’t understand, God! Give me a sign!”

A number of concerned locals from the nearby Prince Edward Yacht Club came out to see if Mr Turnbull was OK but most were turned back by the Prime Minister’s AFP detail.

One of those turned back was Jack Carmichael-Jones-Cornwall-Davidson III, a 48-year-old art curator that’s met Mr Turnbull enough times around Sydney’s Eastern Suburbs to think they’re on a first name basis.

He spoke to our reporter about what he saw down on Felix Bay this afternoon while he took his incontinent 17-year-old King Charles Cavalier bitch for a ‘jolly beach walk’.

“I wanted to go and comfort my friend Malcolm on the jetty but as I started on down the wooden gangway, one of his AFP goons came out of nowhere and put the muzzle of a Glock against my belly button and told me to fuck off,” he said.

“Most crass but the bodyguard did explain that this latest bother with Senator Parry has just tipped Malcolm over the edge,”

“I mean how would you feel? When Malcolm was crushing foreign governments in the High Court and working with Goldman Sachs, Peter Dutton was holding a radar gun on the Bruce Highway, booking people for going 107 in a 100 zone.

Dutton Says Manus Detainees Should Relocate To Town He Won’t Visit Without Armed Guards

TEXT:

Immigration and Border Protection Minister Peter Dutton said the Coalition Government has arranged shelter and other services in the middle of a third-world pacific island community that he wouldn’t even visit without an armed security detail.

Hundreds of refugees inside the Manus Island detention centre are determined to stay, despite power, water and food supplies being cut off, after being scared off by the locals who have already rushed into the the premises to begin looting.

Dutton says he stands by his clear and consistent policy since coming to office that anyone attempting to enter Australia illegally by boat would never settle here, and that alternative arrangements have been made in the township that he will not visit without armed security guards due the social issues faced by this community that has had an Australian detention centre forced upon them and in turn developed an instinctive disdain for foreigners.

“The constant claims of [illegal maritime arrivals] and advocates about their situation in Manus are nothing more than subterfuge,” Mr Dutton said.

“They have long claimed the Manus RPC was a ‘hellhole’ but the moment it was to be closed they demanded it be kept open.”

“Sorry, but we don’t have room. You’ll have to take what you can get, and right now all you can get is a bed in a scary pacific island community with it’s own problems”

Tony Windsor Released Unharmed By National Party Goons After Agreeing Not To Run Against Barnaby Joyce

The National Party of Australia announced this morning that they’ve released Tony Windsor without harm following his suspected abduction on yesterday morning.

Just after lunch on Friday, the former parliamentarian was rushed as he left a popular Tamworth cafe and forced at knifepoint into the boot of a waiting HSV Statesman.

Bound, gagged and hooded, Mr Windsor was dumped around 11 this morning near Glen Innes relatively unharmed.

Following a visit to his local constabulary, the former Independent Member for New England spoke briefly to The Advocate via wireless telephone a short time ago.

“I was enjoying a skinny flat white and a neenish tart with a friend one minute, then the next, I could hear a car driving erratically, Limp Bizkit blearing on the hi-fi inside it as it drew closer,” he recounted.

“Then these men with those boarding school sock wash bags over their heads leap from the car with machetes, dragged me across the wide Tamworth footpath and into the boot of this car,”

“Next thing I know, I have the hood pulled off my head and I’m in a shearing shed surrounded by a number of old foes from the Nationals.”

From there, Windsor says he was told not to run against Joyce in the upcoming New England by-election. If he did, there would be repercussions.

“I’m too old for this type of Canberra horseplay,” he said.

“So I said I wouldn’t run against him. They said they’d cut me if I didn’t agree. Then the goons drove me home and waited inside while I spoke to the media out by the dam that afternoon,”

“Then when I came back, they put me back in the boot and drove me out into the boondocks, out somewhere near Glen Innes, where they tossed me into the table drain and sped off,”

“No hard feelings, politics is one hell of a game.”

Recently self-appointed Minister for Agriculture, the Honourable Malcolm Turnbull MP, has this morning rocked up to his first day on the job wearing a panama hat thats costs more than most Australians would spend on their first car.

Appointed on 27 October 2017, The Prime Minister now holds the badge of Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources, and is assisted by Senator the Hon. Anne Ruston, following the news that former Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce is not eligible to hold public office as a citizen of New Zealand.

“I’ve got this. Don’t you worry” said the former Goldman Sachs executive as he arrived in Deep-North West NSW.

“I own more cattle than the entire Nationals combined. It’s a fact. Ask Lucy”

“Now quick, who do I talk to about getting my hands on some specialized animal feed which consists of corn byproducts – derived from ethanol production – barley, and other grains as well as alfalfa and cottonseed”

“My lord it’s hot. I am quite thankful that Lucy picked me up this Panama Montecristi when she was in Ecuador last month. It keeps the sun off my face, but also allows me to cool my forehead while shooing the flies away”

“It serves as a bellow of sorts. A device constructed to furnish a strong blast of air. Through waving it at myself”

The High Court decision to disqualify senior ministers Barnaby Joyce and Fiona Nash will lead to an “ugly month” of uncertainty for the Turnbull government in parliament.

On Friday the court ruled Joyce and Nash, along with three others, were ineligible to stand for the 2016 election because they were dual citizens of New Zealand and Britain respectively.

Joyce will face a by-election in his seat of New England on December 2 and won’t return to parliament until February at the earliest.

In the meanwhile Turnbull will continue rocking up to country towns wearing resortwear.

High Court Discovers Empirical Evidence That Suggests Malcolm Roberts Is Ineligible To Sit In Federal Parliament

The High Court of Australia has found empirical evidence that disqualifies One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts from sitting in parliament.

Roberts joins a list of five federal politicans that have been ousted from parliament today, which include the likes of the DPM Barnaby Joyce, The Greens Scott Ludlum and Larissa Waters and Fiona Nash of The Nationals. Nick Xenophon and Matt Canavan are safe.

Speaking to a growing media pack outside the High Court this afternoon, an irate Roberts took aim at the powers that removed him from office.

“I asked for empirical evidence,” shouted Roberts, flanked by One Nation leader Pauline Hanson.

“And I certainly fucking got some! It’s disappointing that the ‘Twitteratti’ were given an opportunity to sway the court’s decision, which I plan to appear by the way,”

“As for my future, I plan to return home to Queensland and spend some time doing the things I enjoy the most, like throwing rocks at passing traffic and complaining about living in the greatest country on Earth. Before I leave, I just wanted to extend a giant ‘fuck you’ to all of you in the media. I hope there’s a fire at the press club and you all burn to death. Laters.”

The Advocate can reveal that Mr Roberts and Barnaby Joyce crossed paths on the way out of court this afternoon, where it’s alleged the outgoing senator attempted to high-five the Deputy Prime Minister.

Man Starts Caring About Astronomical Sexual Assault Rate Once It Involves Immigrants

TEXT:

In the wake of the viral #metoo hashtag, out of touch men worldwide have gained some minor understanding of the sexist underbelly pinned beneath our patriarchal society.

Perhaps most surprising is retired cabbie Alistair Coote (72) who has now started caring about sexual assault upon realising the perpetrators are sometimes immigrants.

“They shouldn’t be allowed to do that! You can’t come here illegally and be doing shit like that, it’s just wrong!”

Formerly a taxi driver, Coote was vocal about defending his fellow cab drivers whenever one was accused of sexually assaulting lone female passengers late at night.

“Ridiculous. In all my years on the job, I never met a cabbie who did that sort of thing. It’s a stereotype is what it is. You want to find a rapist, you just need to look at some of these people we’re letting in here!”

When asked for a source for the particular acts of sexual assault Coote was referring to, he responded immediately that he’d heard it on “the radio” and that it was “all over the papers.”

Coote even went as far as to say that the average person didn’t need to listen to his variety of AM radio stations and tabloid journalism to form the same opinion as him.

“Just step outside mate! They’re everywhere and they’re not the same as us, they’re a different culture. They don’t treat women right, no respect.”

We asked Coote’s wife of 45 years, Mary Coote (71), what she thought of his newfound feminism and Alistair was all too happy to answer on her behalf.

“Come on!”

The annual Nats pull-off happens each October during the Northern Australian wet season and celebrates the unique brand of regional politics, highlighting the fact that whoever bucks their head and refuses to move is the likely winner of any professional encounter.

The well-known regional pub game gets its name from the fact that the participants look like goannas when taking part in this competition. The event requires two people to face each other with a heavy leather strap joining them around their necks, then they pull each other in a version of tug-of-war.

After a succesfull win this week with the scrapping of the last bastion of renewable energy reform, Mr Joyce was feeling unbeatable as he dragged the 150 kilo member for Dawson across the mat.

Man Who Used To ‘Bash Poofters’ For Fun Says Leftie Bullies Turned Him Off Voting Yes

TEXT:

A 55-year-old who spent a big part of the eighties looking for gay men to bash at local parks says he was almost considering lending his vote to marriage equality, until ‘these people’ tried to make him feel a certain way.

Bradley, a prominent football manager at his medium-sized coastal hometown, says his past behaviour of going poofter bashing for fun has nothing to do with his current opinions towards the Federal Goverment’s same-sex marriage postal vote.

“It was a different time back then” he said.

“You weren’t made to feel a certain way about people who were different to you. The cops would do it too”

That part of Brad’s life is way behind him now, and he says no one he knows has been bashing shirtlifter since the local boys accidentally killed a German backpacker in 1989 after he ended up being thrown off a 70-foot ocean cliffs in the heat of the moment.

“Bamarama’s not the same anymore” he says.

“Those boys learnt their lesson. It never happened again. Most of them were forced to leave town. This has got nothing to do with my views on traditional marriage”

Brad, who has never married, and has an obscure take on men’s fashion, says the 88 gay men that were either bashed to death or thrown of cliffs to drown between the eighties and nineties in his town and surrounding beaches has nothing to do with his recent decision to vote no against same-sex marriage.

“Mate, I had no problem with it until they tried to force themselves onto me”

Revolutionary New Clinic Successfully Reintroduces Canberra Residents To Life Outside

TEXT:

An amazing new clinic in the outskirts of the Australian Capital Territory has been recognised for it’s world-renowned programs aimed at reintroducing Canberra residents to a life outside their circular inland public service-reliant city.

Species reintroduction is the deliberate release of a species into the wild, from captivity or other areas where the organism survives – and has until now never been successfully applied to people from the Bush Capital.

The lead doctor at the ACTnormal reintroduction clinic, Professor Nadruku, says it’s definitely a gruelling process that they have formulated, but it is one that should equip almost any Canberran for a trip to the beach, or a dress code that specifically asks for no sleeveless hoodies.

“The goal of species reintroduction is to establish a healthy, genetically diverse, self-sustaining population to an area where it has been extirpated, or to augment an existing population”

“While Humans have been reintroducing species for food and pest control for thousands of years, it has taken until now to figure out just what needs to be emphasised in the lives of Canberra residents, before they make tracks elsewhere”

After six years of trials, the professionals at ACTnormal beleive Queanbeyan residents are the easiest to tame, mainly because they could almost play off being your run of the mill regional NSW townies, but the full-blown government babies are by far the hardest.

“Anyone who is born into government families are very hard to prepare for a life outside entitlements and pensions” said Professor Nadruku.

“The same goes for people that arrive in town to work as political staffers in their mid twenties and then want to head back home as a forty year old to run as a Federal Member in their home town”

“We are yet to find success with this particular breed”

As the Member for Warringah comes to blows with both his gay sister and his own daughter, who are staunch defenders of gay marriage, he says he’s never been told what to do by a women – let alone one that he is ranked above in the traditional family structure.

“A vote against marriage equality is a vote against political correctness” he said.

“And my annoying sister”

However, in the weeks following that announcement, Abbott says he has realised that even tearing apart his family is still too taxing on his ideologies, and he must seperate himself from them completely”

“As I have reflected on the approaching halfway mark of more time spent outside of the top job as in it,  the opportunity it presents to refresh team, I have decided that this is the perfect time for me to hand the reins over to my wife, and resign from my family”

“Serving as Prime Minister was been a tremendous honour, as was playing the role of a irrelevant backbencher of the last few months, but I have made clear from the beginning that I was in politics to be as powerful as possible”

“After 10 years in public life, this moment for me has arrived.”

Mr Abbott later addressed the media where he said the career cost of his family had been great, and he struggled not being able to spend time with other backbenchers members who were experiencing the horrible blow of discovering your opinions are irrelevant”

“My family are making it very hard for me to look like I care about Aussie families, because we tend to disagree on everything and it often undermines my efforts to make life hard for Malcolm Turnbull”

“I’ve probably felt that cost more than any other time in the past few months,” he said, trying to maintain his composure.

CSIRO: “Mr Abbott, What You’ve Just Said Is One Of The Most Insanely Idiotic Things I Have Ever Heard. At No Point In Your Rambling, Incoherent Response Were You Even Close To Anything That Could Be Considered A Rational Thought. Everyone In This Room Is Now Dumber For Having Listened To It. I Award You No Points, And May God Have Mercy On Your Soul.”

TEXT:

The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) have today released a statement in response to former prime minister Tony Abbott suggested climate change is “probably doing good”

The devout Catholic who staunchly defends his own ‘opinions’ regarding catastrophic man-made damages to the environment,  gave a speech in his hometown of London, in which he likened policies to combat Climate Change to “primitive people once killing goats to appease the volcano gods” .

While at the ironically titled climate change scepticisim ‘thinktank’ Abbott also told the audience that the ‘talking down’ to those who did not accept climate science was “the spirit of the Inquisition, the thought-police down the ages” –

He also reprised his 2009 assertion that the “so-called settled science of climate change” was “absolute crap” and that hotter temperatures are a good thing if anything, because far more people die in cold snaps.

“At least so far,” he said, “it’s climate change policy that’s doing harm. Climate change itself is probably doing good; or at least, more good than harm.”

The CSIRO, who have spent the last decade tiptoeing greatly around the once most powerful politician in Australia, say that they can no longer allow Australians to be exposed to such a dangerous level on anti-intellectualism.

Larry Marshall, who is CEO of the federal government agency for scientific research in Australia, says that having millions of dollars and jobs gutted from the organisation’s climate science department was bad enough, but for Abbott to then deny any of the world they had done before that was too much.

Larry Marshall: “Mr Abbott, what you’ve just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.

Marshall then went on to point out that the rising sea levels are only going to create an influx of refugees from the pacific islands, as well as thousands of more cyclones, bushfires, floods and droughts for the Australian people who don’t live in Sydney’s North Shore.

“Please stop what you are doing”

Dulux Identify World’s Palest Shade Of White After Bill Shorten’s Appearance On NOVA

TEXT:

What will back the rendered brick walls of suburban Australian McMansions be wearing next year? The shade of the near-future is a muted neutral-white, according to iconic paint company Dulux.

The company has declared that the newest colour identified by their scientists is known as Bill ShortenTM, a name meant to evoke a wider theme: the concept of carrying on like the whitest man on the planet while on NOVA with Fitzy and Whippa.

According to the paint brand, when times get tough, we make absolute fools of ourself and in turn ridicule another culture with freestyle rap video, alongside Ray Hadley – while mimicking black Americans in half-hearted sportswear.

This comes as Opposition leader Bill Shorten failed to go viral on Fitzy and Wippa’s weekly rap battle this morning. In his ‘freestyle’ rap, the Labor MP managed to make Turnbull’s appearance on the Project look like ABC Radio.

“It was appalling. Simply disgusting” says Liberal cabinet minister and staunch hip hop fan, Christopher Pyne.

“When will Australian people stop laughing at hip hop. It’s an art not a punchline for radio hosts”

“As a proud South Australian, I am very honoured to say I come from the same region as the Hilltop Hoods – where we respect hip hop”

“What Bill Shorten did was not far from Chris Lilley’s $mouse character in his worst ABC season”

Next week, The Betoota Advocate will be hosting a panel show in Sydney’s Newtown on ‘Betoota VS Aussie Hip Hop’ – all locals are encouraged to join as we talk to Rappers Joyride, 24 Karat Kev and DJ FlexMami about everything in this article. GO HERE for more details:

Grown Men That Fought Against 18C Say Their Feelings Are Being Hurt By Gay Teenagers

TEXT:

In a bizarre coincidence, Australia’s staunchest defenders of free speech are also the most vulnerable to mean tweets from gay activists, who they say are overly aggressive, intolerable and mean.

The grown men, most of who usually only make headlines in a slow news cycle with their comments about repealing section 18c from the racial discrimination act which makes adults legally accountable for racial abusing minorities, say that straight Christian men are being horrifically politicised when it comes to the marriage equality debate.

Senators Eric Abetz and Cory Bernardi as well as the equally conservative lower house bible-bashers George Christensen and Tony Abbott have made headlines over the last fortnight by accusing gay teenagers of saying hurtful things about straight white men, as the overly-expensive same-sex marriage debate reaches it’s most feral premiership lap.

The well-known public servants say that the whole free speech thing should only apply to people like Andrew Bolt when he wants to publicly deny that the Stolen Generation ever happened – and not Yassmin Abdel-Magied or anyone who wants to lift their shirts.

“The YES campaigners are out of control” says Abbott.

“They are feral. Out of control. They are hurting my feelings with their comments about my Church and it’s dysfunctional affect on my family ”

Abbott, who made headlines last week for suggesting a politically-charged pop song should be ‘banned’ from the NRL grand final, says this has nothing to do with his drifting faction’s stance on 18c.

“It’s not the same. Aboriginal jokes are different to being teased because you are uncomfortable around gays”

Senator Bernardi, who left the Liberal Party this year to start an underwhelming, more conservative version of it, says 18c should still be removed but they should keep something their to stop the gays from being so mean.

“18C should be removed to protect people like me with cultural blind spots. It’s ruined a lot of barbeques for me because now I can’t trot out the jokes I used to love making”

“But how are the gays getting away with this stuff. You should see my inbox from those kids at the school wearing dresses. They are so nasty”

Abbott Criticises Afternoon Shower For Mixing Politics With Weather Patterns

TEXT:

Tony Abbott has caused controversy again today after an explosive rant at the earth’s weather systems.

The former Prime Minister who last week criticised the NRL for allowing the US rapper Macklemore to play his 2nd highest rating song at the Grand Final because he said it promoted the “Yes” campaign, has caused a stir again today

After a slight rainbow appeared near his Northern Beaches hinterland home Abbott exploded saying the country deserved to be able to enjoy normal weather patterns without being bombarded by Yes campaigners.

“This is unbelievable. I have no idea how they figured out to do manipulate the weather like that but it just shows you how pervasive this campaign really is,” said Abbott.

Ignoring questions about the previous “No” skywriting a couple of weeks ago, Abbott said that people shouldn’t have messages shoved down their throats.

“And also,” Mr Abbott said, “Why do the gays get to own rainbows anyway? It’s not fair.”

Lane Cove resident Sam Wallace who was actually always going to vote “No” just to spite the left-wing and the ABC told the Advocate that this whole rainbow thing is the final straw.

“Congratulations Yes campaign. I really wanted to vote Yes but your persistent hassling and militant campaign have made me decide to vote No,” the 30-year-old mens rights activist posted on Facebook today.

Wallace, whose Facebook profile has an Australian flag filter and describes him as a warrior against Political correctness, is a reasonably proud Evangelical Christian who confirmed that he has actually spent a fair few days in his life knocking on people’s doors trying to preach the way of the lord to them.

“That’s spreading the word of our lord mate. It’s far less invasive than a rainbow, a pop song and a one off text message.”

Unemployed Scott Ludlam Says He Loves Being Able To Spend So Much Time On His Crop

TEXT:

As one of two federal politicians who probably won’t be working again this term due to citizenship issues, former Greens Senator Scott Ludlam says he’s really loving the time off.

“It’s mad” he says, while tying a bandana over his recently-bleached yellow hair.

“I’ve been needing this for a while, hey. Last year was a crazy one”

The Commonwealth will argue only One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts and former Greens senator Scott Ludlam should be found to have been wrongly elected to Parliament at the last election.

They are among seven politicians facing the High Court, after questions were raised about whether their dual citizenship made them ineligible to hold office. Section 44 of the constitution bans anyone with dual citizenship from being elected to Parliament.

However, unlike Roberts, who will never ever get the opportunity to be a federal politician again – there is an argument that Scott Ludlam should just sit this next term out, renounce his citizenship at some point and then have another crack at winning his spot back in 2019.

“I plan on doing just that”

“Till then I’ll be playing shitloads of Sublime and tending to my ‘erbs” he says with a comedic Jamaican accent.

“I’ve spent a lot of time and energy on the Australian Greens, now it’s time to focus on Luddy’s greens [giggles]”

Self-Hating Millennial Pretends To Care About Weird Boomer Shit

TEXT:

A prominent Gen-Y social commentator has been having a particularly hard time trying to harness the same audiences as Alan Jones and Steve Price, while also trying to avoid being a class and generation traitor.

Paul ‘The Boomer Liason’ Murray has for many years now made a career broadcasting hot button issues that really don’t affect anyone from his generation, but keep the post-war generation’s blood hot, and also makes them feel like they aren’t getting old and bitter because there is a young person who says what they are thinking.

With the gay marriage debate heating up, Murray has been quick to tackle the issue of ‘whingeing lefties’ while also delicately trying to not promote his own deeply-closeted progressive brand of politics.

“It’s political correctness gone mad” he says, in a vague shot at the left without really going near his own stance on marriage equality.

“Wheres the common sense?!?”

As a young Australian commentator, Paul Murray struggles to advocate the instinctive opinions of a majority of people his age and younger, who don’t necessarily feel threatened by equality, while also letting his grey army of rusted on retirees that their is nothing wrong with their prejudices.

Much like the template of conservative talkback mentors, Paul Murray’s Sky News program, Paul Murray Live has gradually evolved into a series of rants about topics that resonate with upper middle class baby boomers, who despite their track record of warehousing poor black kids in prison, destroying the environment, crippling a national housing market and declaring unnecessary wars – all with the help of free university degrees – still feel as though they’ve had it harder than any Australians before or after them.

“Where’s the respect. These sooks have it too easy nowadays” he roars down the camera, with tears welling in his eyes.

“I’m young and I agree with you, at home!”

“Tax payer funded ABC! Sooks! Stricter sentencing! Political correctness! Australia Day! LGBTI bullies! What’s protesting gonna do!? Go get a job! ANZAC! Boats!”

Gay Christians Fed Up With Having To Have Gay Sex Outside Of Gay Wedlock

TEXT:

A couple of lavender-scented local blokes say that the Church should actually consider how many people are being forced to sin because they aren’t allowed to get married.

The inner-Betoota bookshop owners say that they have tried their best to live a life in accordance with the Lord’s word, but eventually they got sick of waiting for equal rights and made the decision to root eachother out of wedlock.

“Believe me, no one is more disappointed in all of this than us” says Toddy, life partner of Kev.

“We are mainly disappointed with the church and government for excluding us – but we are also disappointed in ourselves for not waiting out another couple decades until we were legally bound as hubbies by law”

With the postal plebiscite currently dividing the town into two camps, those who don’t give a fuck and would prefer to not discriminate against another person just for the sake of it, and those who feel that voting NO will teach the left-wing a lesson about trying to convince them to show compassion – Kev and Toddy just want to be able to stop sinning.

Queensland government announce buyback of deadly single-use plastic bags

Coming just a day after banning single-use plastic bags, the Premier of Queensland has told the media this afternoon that the state government will establish a bag buyback scheme to start in 2018.

Annastacia Palaszczuk spoke to reporters briefly today after he the Queensland parliament voted to ban the environmental hazard.

“Today is a red-letter day for the people of Queensland,” said the Premier.

“Many have tried to stop us, many have threatened the government but none have been able to slow the train of progress. To those who still own illegal plastic bags, there is an amnesty that lasts until June 30 next year. Turn in your bags to avoid prosecution,”

“We are once again, ‘The Smart State’, as Peter Beattie once said. We are on the right side of history.”

However, those in the power plastic bag lobby have vowed to fight the decision.

Dennis Coleman, who lists his hobbies on LinkedIn as, ‘shooting dolphins and yelling at his wife in public’, told The Advocate that he and his friends in the plastic industry wouldn’t take this lying down.

“This isn’t over,” said Coleman.

“We’re going to take the fight to Ms Palaszczuk and her socialist government of do-gooders,”

“Has she thought of the men and women who work in the single-use plastic bag industry? Has she thought about their families? The answer to that question is no,”

The saga continues.

Miranda Devine Points Out Obvious Correlation Between Gay Marriage And Road Deaths

TEXT:

The undeniably rise of road accidents in small town’s that don’t have any gay people can be directly attributed to the smug and irrational arguments for gay marriage, it has been confirmed.

After already making headlines for yesterday’s column in the Daily Telegraph which linked Sydney City’s strong support for the YES campaign, and a Court inquest into suicides in remote Aboriginal communities in February – Miranda Devine has once again proven how long her bow is, in her quest to appeal to people who feel oppressed by two men pashing in public.

“Gays, and their equally sinful straight allies, just don’t care about everyday Australians dying on our roads” writes Miranda Devine

“It’s pretty clear that since this whole debate has started, we have seen a monstrous rise in road deaths in towns where people feel like politicians are useless and that minorities get more attention paid to them”

“Essentially, as a Daily Telegraph reader, that means you are at risk of dying on our roads – purely because the gay population want their cake and want to eat it as well”

“It’s just shameful”

However, local lesbian, Shazza, says she takes nothing but extreme precautions when getting around town in her Subaru station wagon – and can’t believe she’s being blamed for this shit.

“I haven’t been in an accident in me whole loife (sic)” she says.

“This has noithing to do woith us”

“Tell Miranda to come down to the Bedourie indoor hockey courts if she’s got a problem with me”

Brandis Respectfully Disagrees With Dan Sultan Over Kanye’s Best Pre-Yeezus Album

TEXT:

Singer-songwriter Dan Sultan has clashed with Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie and Attorney-General George Brandis on Q&A over the best Kanye West pre-2013 album.

Senator Brandis has been outspoken on the topic for many years, especially following the release of West’s most divisive album yet, The Life Of Pablo.

“Kanye released Yeezus around about the same time I was offered the role of Attorney-General” he said.

“Granted, I was going through some big changes in my life, but I don’t think it was quite at the level of my Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy”

Dan Sultan, who has in the past actively put his support behind ‘College Drop Out’ says he doesn’t necessarily agree that the synth heavy fifth-studio album, MBDTF, was anywhere near the Louis Vuitton backpack-era Kanye.

“Pardon the pun, but Jesus walked on that album”

“The gospel choirs, the content – everything was a lot more pure – this is how artists and musicians feel”

Brandis, who kept interrupting Sultan during his most crucial points, says while he respects the opinion of a practicing musician on this issue – majority of Australia disagrees with him, and so does most of the silver-haired caucasian baby boomers in Parliament.

“Dan, frankly and respectfully, if you don’t think Nikki Minaj’s verse in Monster is the most fire thing to come out of the Roc-a-Fella dynasty – I would have to notify you that there are rocks in your head”

Jacqui Lambie was quick to point out that anyone who doesn’t think 808s and Heartbreaks was the best Kanye Album of all time doesn’t know what real love-making music is.

American rock trio, The Goo Goo Dolls, have told reporters this afternoon that maverick New Englandese politician, Tony Windsor, served as inspiration for their 1998 smash hit ‘Iris’ – one of the biggest alternative rock staples of the 1990s.

The band’s frontman, John Rzeznik, the delivered the shocking bombshell today during an interview with our reporter in New York City after being asked whether the similarities between the song’s lyrics and Mr Windsor’s career were more than just a coincidence.

“Yeah sure, whatever,” said Rzeznik.

“Do you want to talk about my new album or not? Every interview I’ve done for the past 20 years has been about that fucking song,”

The Advocate‘s reporter told the American songbird that he didn’t want to talk about his new album because it ‘sucks’. Mr Rzeznik then got up and left.

Mr Rzeznik then got up and left.

However, the song has now re-entered the Australian Top 40 for the first time since Babe: Pig In The City graced the nation’s silver screen.

While Mr Windsor’s office declined to comment wholly on the matter, they did release a short statement explain that it’s a coincidence, but the line, ‘I don’t want the world to see me, ‘cos I don’t think that they’d understand, that when everything is meant to be broken, I just want you to know who I am,’ does ring true in regards to Mr Windsor’s political career.

Liberals Encourage Abbott To Blame As Much Stuff As Possible On His Drinking

TEXT:

Following the news that Abbott has admitted to drinking too much and sleeping through several votes in federal parliament in 2009, his party colleagues are encouraging him to use this defence on as much stuff as possible while its still valid.

During an interview with Annabel Crabb in an upcoming episode of the ABC series The House, Abbott says he “lay down and next thing I knew it was morning”

Mr Turnbull was opposition leader at the time and was trying to oppose the Rudd government’s stimulus measures. He has told radio 3AW that Mr Abbott was drunk but “there was nothing we could do” – as colleagues could just could not wake Mr Abbott as he slept on the couch.

However, close Abbott allies in the Coalition have suggested that the former Prime Minister could use this whole drinking thing to explain and excuse some of his more notable gaffes.

“Just say you were drunk when you told those Aussie troops that “shit happens” after their mates was killed at war” says Tasmanian Senator Eric Abetz.

“Or when you winked when that lady said she was working on a sex line because you cut her pension” said Dutton.

“Or when you munged into a raw onion, twice on live television” said another no-name backbencher.

“Howard Was The Best PM We Ever Had” Says Bloke Wearing Sleeveless Puffy Jacket

TEXT:

A local bloke, who was barely even a teenager when John Howard was voted out of power, has today regurgitated his conservative father’s drunken golf rant that suggests the former Prime Minister was the greatest Australian leader in modern history.

It is not yet known to the other punters at the Lord Kidman hotel why Hunter Bligh (22) feels the need to ruin a perfectly good piss up with weird political conversations, but the fact he is wearing a sleeveless puffy jacket with a checkered shirt says enough.

The former half-back for one of the most prestigious private schools in Western Queensland has paired his ‘concrete cowboy’ look with a pair of khaki chinos and dark brown dress boots – the type of outfit usually reserved for young Australian men who are confident they will never have to join the military and fight unnecessary wars in the Middle East.

“Mate” he says.

“Easily the best Prime Minister. He really gave it to those unions and wouldn’t get pushed around by the outrage professionals. He was a true politicians”

Throughout his rant about “scum Labor” and “union grubs”, the aspiring cryptocurrency broker begins to sound like he is just flat out making stuff up, as no one around him is old enough to clarify some of the bold claims he is making about John Howard’s political career.

In his lengthy explanation of how shit every other Prime Minister has been, Mr Bligh is quick to reference to the 1997 gun reform, which draws nods from the extremely bored people listening to him.

“Mate, name me one Labor government who could have pulled that thing off”

While appearing to talk from ‘life experience’ when discussing trade laws and tax breaks, Hunter is yet to reveal that he still lives at home and refuses to pay rent to his valium-addled parents because he needs to save for a new start-up idea.

Things Sufficiently Fucked Enough For Turnbull To Kick Off Australia Day Debate In August

TEXT:

Prime Minister Turnbull has last night relaunched into a debate usually reserved for that weird part of the year where everyone is looking for something to do after New Years Eve.

Australia Day. It’s a divisive issue, but one that we usually wait until January to jump back into arguing about and never resolving.

However, with the citizenship of a large number of federal politicians and lawmakers currently under question, the head of the Australian Catholic church currently awaiting a court date for child sex crimes, and the entire nation preparing to vote on whether or not gay people are humans, The Turnbull government has trotted out a bizarre issue for this time of the year.

“I know my entire government is under siege and we are dumping a lot of money into really pointless exercises but I would just like to say something quite inflammatory so we have something else to talk about”

“So, here we go [clears throat]”

“Australia Day, Aussie pride, Keep Australia Day, don’t change Australia Day, postal vote, Aussie pride, Aussie Spirit, Gallipoli”

These comments come after Melbourne’s City of Yarra council chose to scrap Australia Day celebrations on the public holiday of January 26 out of respect to Indigenous Australians, who recognise the day as one of mourning, not flag waving and binge drinking.

Prime Minister Turnbull has responded by stripping the council of its power to hold citizenship ceremonies. City of Yarra councillors on Tuesday night voted unanimously to scrap all council-run celebrations acknowledging January 26 as Australia Day, after a consultation process in which community and indigenous groups called the date a “culturally-sensitive event acknowledging the loss of culture, language and identity felt by the community on January 26.”

Australian Politicians Told To Renounce Their Home Country’s Stance On Gay Marriage

TEXT:

Following the news that Nationals Leader, Barnaby Joyce is actually a citizen of a country that recognised gay marriage, conservative factions within both his party and the Liberals have urged him to renounce New Zealand’s stance on gay marriage.

It is believed that the same issue has been brought to light in the ranks of the Labor Party, as the powerful, but much-less talked about conservative party members also urge any dual-citizens to renounce their other home country’s stance on gay marriage, unless it is one that agrees with Australia’s current laws.

The Feircely patriotic Liberal party jester, Tony Abbott, who was born in England, has today come out demanding all Australian politician’s who hold dual-citizenship should renounced their non-Australian country’s stance on gay marriage.

“It’s aaahh. It’s just not a good look that these people… For one, they come from another country, and ahhh.. Aren’t Australian, but what makes them even more unAustralian is that most of their perverted home countries agree with gay marriage”

“Quite frankly, in my opinion, that is unAustralian – I plan to spend the next two months talking about how UnAustralian that is, and to steer this debate towards an elitist verse working class issue”

“Where, I, of course will play the champion of the working class – from right at home in my North Shore mansion”

It is believed, Penny Wong, a possible dual-national to Malaysia had already renounced her family’s home country’s stance on gay marriage years ago – mainly because it is even more discriminative than Australia’s policy – and because she’s a lesbian.

Barnaby Joyce Questioned About Plans To Turn Adani Mine Into World’s Biggest Hāngī

TEXT:

Embattled Deputy Prime Minister, Barnaby Joyce is under fire today, as GetUp campaigners reveal leaked documents that suggest his support for the $21 billion Adani coal project in central Queensland’s Galilee Basin was purely so that he could cook a mean feed for all of his bros.

Transcripts between the Member For New England and Indian coal magnate, Guatam Adani, show that Mr Joyce was willing to support whatever infrastructure developments were needed to aid the project – so long as he was allowed to use the giant open-cut hole in the ground when they were finished.

“It’ll be choice, bro” said Mr Joyce.

“I’ll invite all the family around and we’ll get stuck in to a mean Hāngī”

The uniquely New Zealand Hāngī is a style of cooking where different ingredients are traditionally wrapped in flax leaves underground foliage with cloth sacks, aluminium foil and wire baskets on top of hot coals. Common conconctions include pork, mutton or lamb, potato, pumpkin, cabbage and stuffing are also included.

The result of this long process is tender, off-the-bone meat and delicious vegetables, all infused with a smoky, earthy fragrance, something that Mr Joyce is apparently quite fond of.

Mr Joyce has previously said the Adani coal mine project will create 10,000 jobs and inject huge sums into the economy – but failed to mention his interest in cooking a barbecue in the giant open-cut coal mine.

When questioned about these revelations by journalists today, Mr Joyce said GetUp was “awff their heads”.

The former Member for New England Tony Windsor has revealed that a recent visit to the New Zealand High Commission in Canberra last week was unrelated to the Barnaby Joyce citizenship crisis.

Earlier this morning, the Deputy Prime Minister told Parliament that he’s referring himself to the High Court of Australia after the Kiwis got in touch over the weekend regarding his eligibility for citizenship.

Joyce’s father was born on Aotearoa and came to Australia in 1947, meaning the Tamworth father is eligible for New Zealandanese citizenship should he apply for it.

However, Joyce has said neither he or his parents have any reason to think he’s anything but Australian.

“This is just a precautionary measure,” said Barnaby.

“It’s highly unlikely that I’m New Zealandanese, but I am eligible under their law so I’m referring myself to the High Court to clear myself. That’s all.”

However, it’s understood by The Advocate that his arch-nemesis Tony Windsor was seen at the New Zealand High Commission in Canberra last week.

“It’s just a coincidence, I guess,” said Windsor.

“I was there to apply for a, ahh, a yeee a work visa, you see?”

“There’s a nice job going in Christchurch working on land access and renewal. It’s a pretty plumb job and I’m simply bored of being retired. Us old farmers enjoy keeping busy. You hear those stories about cockies retiring off and having nothing to do and they end up croaking [laughs] So yeah. Massive coincidence.”

Turnbull reveals postal vote on gay marriage will only cost twice as much as his house is worth

TEXT:

The Prime Minister of Australia has told a number of Canberra journalists this afternoon that the cost of the post vote on same sex marriage has been ‘blown out of proportion’ as it’ll only cost twice as much as his Point Piper house is worth.

“When you think of it like that,” said Turnbull.

“It doesn’t sound like that much, does it? This is just more scaremongering from the Labor Party and The Greens. It actually won’t cost that much,”

“Aside from all the hate speech we’re going to expose the gay community to over the next could of months, this should all blow over and we can get back to doing our jobs.”

Mr Turnbull’s Felix Bay residence has been valued conservatively at $40m with some estimates reaching as high as $60m when the underground bunker is taken into account which houses the Prime Minister’s vast HO scale train set.

In addition to the alleged train bunker, the roof is set to be stacked to the rafters with gold bullion gifted to him after the Spycatcher trial by the Russian Federation.

“If we have to blow $122m on something i’ll never acknowledge, why not climate change?”

TEXT:

The non-binding and possibly unlawful postal vote plebiscite to determine whether or not Australia is ready to treat gay people like adults will be a waste of money, says Queensland MP, George Christensen.

“Not because it will accurately determine the sentiments held by people outside parliament house, but because those sentiments won’t be acknowledged by the house of representatives” he says.

With $120 million expected to go towards organising the 18th century form of voter technology, Christensen says there’s not much point because if his electorate doesn’t want gay marriage, he’ll vote against it.

“Some people will vote against it regardless of what their electorate says”

“Tony will be voting against it purely to spite his his sister”

“And because George is back in town and we need to impress”

Christensen says that at the end of the day – passing gay marriage in Australia was always going to be as hard as it possibly could be – and that the government should redirect that money into the mining sector.

“Either that or climate change” he says.

“I’d love to see what these so-called scientists could pull out of their arse with $120 million”

“If we are going to blow money on something that my electorate of sugar cane farmers and retirees don’t believe in, it may as well be climate change”

Nation looks forward to day when the jobs of politicians become automated

TEXT:

After a disastrous week so far in federal politics, a leading research body has revealed that the overwhelming majority of Australians are looking forward to the day when Parliament is made up of robots.

Roy Morgan Research released their findings this afternoon after a phone survey was conducted by the group this afternoon as the nation grows more and more impatient with their elected officials.

“It seems most people in Australia would like to see these politicians replaced by automation, whereby they can automatically come up with a policy that accurately reflects the opinion of the majority,” said one researcher on the project.

“Plus, we don’t need to fly them anywhere. Drive them anywhere. Fuck, we wouldn’t even need to pay them anything,”

“We could email them over for state visits and if they get a virus, like One Nation, we can just run Norton to get rid of them. Not have to wait until the next election. The general feeling is that when politicians have their jobs automated, shit will be cash.”

However, a number of top-ranking political figures have quickly dismissed the idea, saying that humans will always be better at governing humans and that the notion job automation is just out to scare the working class.

“You might be able to replace a robot like Christopher Pyne with an actual robot,” said the Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce.

“But you can’t replace someone like me with a robot. Robots don’t know anything about cattle or sheep. Maybe we could start phasing some out with robots? I would be open to that idea.”

Tony Abbott Says He’ll Support Gay Marriage If That’s What His Voters Want No Homo

TEXT:

While exhausting all options left to find ways to avoid legalising gay marriage, Tony Abbott has said a postal vote might work but a plebiscite could be better, while talking out of school on 2GB with Ray Hadley.

Mr Abbott said he would argue in the party room Monday that while a non-compulsory postal ballot was “better than a free vote”, there were questions “about how authoritive it would be”.

“There has to be a plebiscite,” he said.

In an interview with 2GB’s Ray Hadley, Abbott issued a warning against a postal vote on same-sex marriage as the coalition was urged to “grow a pair” on the controversial issue.

The devout Catholic, upper North Shore public servant said giving Australians a say on gay marriage via the post might be a better alternative to a parliamentary vote, as he holds concerns that not every elected official is as keen on oppressing the LGBTI community as he is.

But the former prime minister queried how much real authority a postal plebiscite would have – stating that he was worried that his niche community of religiously homophobic child abuse apologists might not be as well represented in a nation-wide vote.

“I just worry that conservative Manly Sea Eagles scarf-wearing old property owners won’t get a big enough say on the issue” he said

“But if, ultimately, ahh, the majority of the nation supports gay marriage, then ahhh, I’ll have to support it too”

“No homo”

No homo is a phrase used as slang at the end of a sentence to assert the statement spoken by the speaker had no intentional homosexual implications. The phrase is “added to a statement in order to rid them of a possible homosexual double-entendre” – Most commonly used by males, it is, “a way of flagging one’s straight status and claiming its privilege”. It is a form of “identity construction in discourse via societal legitimization” for heterosexual males and a mechanism for which to distance oneself from any notion of homosexual intent.

After specifying how straight he was, Mr Abbott referenced secretly recorded comments Mr Pyne made to a factional gathering a month ago in which he said a resolution to same sex marriage was not far off.

“Plainly there has been talk behind the scenes by the same-sex marriage lobby for some time” Mr Abbott said.

“Christopher Pyne was a key part of that.”

Abbott: “Prospect of possible gay divorces in the future will just about do me”

TEXT:

The former prime minister Tony Abbott today revealed to journalists that he understands that he probably can’t stop the gay marriage train from leaving the platform – but the prospect of ‘very dramatic and catty’ gay divorces in the future is ‘a bridge too far’ for the big Catholic.

Speaking to a number of local reporters at the Betoota Press Club luncheon this afternoon, the bible-thumping Sydneysider said that while he can stomach the thought of having gay people getting married and possibly coexisting heterosexual people, it’s just that he feels the nation isn’t ready for gay divorce.

“In the event of gay marriage being passed,” said Abbott.

“We need to put in place measures to make sure these ‘marriages’ go the distance and don’t end in divorce. In fact, gay divorce should be outlawed in the event of gay marriage being legalised,”

“That’s what the people want from us all. Compromise.”

After receiving his applause from the Club’s handyman and some local landowners, Abbott retired from the stage to his waiting seat beside Mayor Keith Carton, who slapped him just a little bit too hard on his back in congratulations.

The Advocate can reveal that Mr Abbott enjoyed the pork option for lunch but opted to go without the traditional apple sauce, which offended Mr Carton.

Barnaby Joyce tells Turnbull that he should’ve told Trump to go and get fucked

The Deputy Prime Minister phoned his Liberal counterpart this morning to offer his support after a transcript of a telephone call between Donald Trump and Malcolm Turnbull was leaked to the media overnight.

Barnaby Joyce told the Prime Minister that he should’ve told the President of the United States to go and get fucked after he bullishly disrespected him and belittled his many achievements and mistakes as the leader of our nation.

“Mate, I just read the transcript,” said Joyce.

“What a mundry cunt that bloke is, you should’ve told him to go and get fucked, boori. Don’t let him push you around like that next time. Actually, next time he calls up, put me on and I’ll tell him what’s up and what’s down,”

“Oi, but yeah. Do you have his number? I’ll put it on Gumtree selling cheap concert tickets or put it up on an ad selling cheap pitbull or staffie pups in Logan. His phone will ring off the hook it will.”

It’s understood by The Advocate that each time Mr Joyce swore down the telephone line, the Prime Minister winced just a little bit and tried to interject – but Barnaby was on a roll.

“And another thing!” said Barnaby, moments before the Prime Minister hung up on him.

Even Laurie Oakes has had enough of this shit, retires.

The loudest voice in Australian political journalism has announced his retirement this afternoon, bring to an end a career that has spanned some 49 years.

Laurie Oakes made the shock admission earlier today after revealed to reporters that he’s simply ‘had enough of this shit’ and that ‘he’s getting too old to deal with it.’

“With the prospect of another spill on the horizon, it’s just too much for me. They really take it out of a journalist,” said Oakes.

“While there have been many highs and lows throughout my long career, this current period of prolonged political bed-shitting done by every single branch of federal politics has just worn me out and it made me realise that I’m just getting too old for it,”

“As for my successor, I wish Charles Croucher all the best. As a fellow husky gent who’s not afraid of sinking a tin and taking the first hit-up, I feel he’ll grow into the role and mature, finally, as a journalist.”

“Thank you and go and get fucked, all of you.”

Oakes then left the Canberra Press Gallery and made his way downstairs to the canteen, where he enjoyed his last quiche and Strawberry Moove.

As for what he plans on doing next, the septuagenarian told The Advocate that he plans on enjoying a short beach holiday before returning to his native Lithgow.

“It will be nice to return to Lithgow, the Detroit of New South Wales, to catch up with friends. Perhaps throw a few rocks at passing road trains for old times sake and try the ice that I keep hearing about.”

Dastyari Calls For Ban On All Donations Unless Someone’s Keen To Spot His Flights Again

TEXT:

Labor senator Sam Dastyari has called for an end to the way in which parties compete for donations, and a total ban on all future political donations – unless someone wants to sort out some flights for him on his next trip to China.

“I mean, there’s just no need for businesses both in and outside Australia to be giving money to the Government” he said.

“Unless of course our officials find themselves strapped during a trip and someone offers to pick up the bill”

This comes after Dasher’s resignation from Labor’s frontbench last September in the wake of a political donations scandal, where the senator stood down from his position as Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate – after it was revealed that he had asked Top Education, a company with links to the Chinese state – to pay an overspend on his office’s travel of $1,670.

“That was a one-off, and it really ruined my whole halal snack pack thing I had going on at the time”

Chris Lilley’s Hilarious New Show About A Gay Zombie ANZAC To Debut On ANZAC Day

TEXT:

The public broadcaster has today stood behind iconic comedian, Chris Lilley’s new character: the flamboyantly homosexual WWI zombie infantryman, Frank Sweetman.

Veterans organisations have today criticised the idea of satirising the death of thousands of Australians still buried on the shores of Gallipoli, but Chris Lilley says it’s art and we need to respect his creativeness as a North Shore Sydney social commentator.

It seems The Summer Heights High producer has done his best to offend and hurt every other Australian that he hasn’t done so already – with gay rights groups asking if it really is necessary to have the character of Frank Sweetman rooting the corpses of deceased Turkish troops

The ABC, however, says the planned release for April next year is still going ahead – despite people asking if we can just leave Chris Lilley to keep pretending to be a high school girl.

“We stand by our decision to allow Chris Lilley the budget to do whatever he wants to do whenever he feels like doing it” said one spokesman for the ABC.

“Some people ave said that maybe he has flown to close to the sun, but Andrew Denton says he’s good so we are gonna just ignore the whole blackface thing”

This comes after the Aussie comedian was branded “horrifically racist” and “insensitive” after posting his  2012 music video “Squashed N***a” on Instagram, just hours after thousands descended on Melbourne’s CBD to protest the sentence given to the man accused of Aboriginal teenager Elijah Doughty’s death.

Elected officials entrusted with our laws and taxes unfamiliar with concept of citizenship

TEXT:

A bunch of stubborn and argumentative individuals who have risen to the top of federal politics off the back of their ability to create new taxes and laws, have this week revealed that they are not that familiar with the concept of citizenship.

As defined by Oxford ‘Citizenship is the status of a person recognized under the custom or law as being a legal member of a sovereign state or part of a nation. A person may have multiple citizenships and a person who does not have citizenship of any state is said to be stateless.’

In Australia, it appears a large number of our politicians are in possession of dual-citizenship, which according to Australian law, means they cannot be politicians.

Concerns have arisen over the competence of our elected officials if they can’t seem to understand the basic criteria needed to become elected officials in the first place.

While many find it interesting that the entire work load of contemporary federal politicians is based around debating the fate of boat people who are not holding citizenship, it appears the burden of having ‘too much citizenship’ is also one that can result in drama throughout Parliament House.

This comes after sources inside the Liberal party say there is great concern in the party that Chisholm MP Julia Banks may have been ineligible to stand at the last election – after the resignations of Senator Ludlam, Waters, Canavan and the yet to be confirmed citizenship status of Senator Malcolm Roberts.

Malcolm Roberts Spotted Discreetly Watching Sachin Tendulkar Highlights In Office

TEXT:

Debates rage over controversial One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts, and whether he is eligible to sit in Parliament today, after the climate skeptic nationalist refused to release documents proving he has renounced his dual-citizenship elsewhere in the world.

Senator Roberts was born in India and his father was Welsh, but he denies he is a dual citizen in either of those countries and has released a statutory declaration after coming under pressure to clarify his status, due to the resignation of two Greens senators with dual citizenship and Matt Canavan quitting the Cabinet for the same reason.

However, suspicions have reignited today after several reporters spotted the Queensland senator watching an eight minute Youtube video titled ‘Sachin Tendulkar on Beast Mode !! Most Aggressive Batting VS NZ !!’

The Senator, who was voted in as a senator last year off the back of a far-right populist anti-multiculturalist party, has denied that his love of Sachin Tendulkar is proof of his possible dual-Indian citizenship.

“I just like watching highlights of early 2000s Indian cricketers” he said, before doing that little nod thing that Indians do.

“No one played like Sachin”

“But this is in no way enough evidence to stop me from bringing down the leftist media’s communist climate change conspiracy”

Birth records available online show Senator Roberts was recorded as a expatriated national in the past, but that would not affect his eligibility if he had subsequently renounced it.

Senator Roberts has not explained why he has not released any paperwork to prove he does not hold another citizenship, or show the rest of his Youtube search history.

Analysts predict that, in true One Nation fashion, Roberts will never admit to possibly being wrong, even if presented with fool-proof government evidence.

One Nation Voter Wearing Midnight Oil Shirt Says He’s Sick Of Do-Gooder Lefties

TEXT:

Local patriot Wyatt Wergonclasman (59) says he doesn’t know what’s happened to this country.

He says we used to be proud of being Aussie, and wouldn’t let anyone walk all over us – especially not these lefties with all of their leftie do-gooding.

“Whatever happened to being a proud Aussie?” he asks.

“Once upon a time all of these leftie actors and singers would be 100% behind Pauline Hanson. Instead of condemning her”

Wyatt says songs like Khe Sanh by Cold Chisel, and Beds Are Burning by Midnight Oil remind him of a time when Aussies weren’t being made to feel guilty about things he had nothing to do with.

“Khe Sanh is a good Aussie song. No one makes music like that anymore”

“Or the Oil! Real Aussie rock. I went to every one of their shows back in the day”

Back when all the hippies were listening to their hippy shit in the seventies and eighties, Wyatt was going to pub rock gigs and being proud to be an Aussie. He says the PC police have too much power nowadays and you can’t turn on the radio without hearing someone trying to ram their political beliefs down your throat.

The fact almost every single one of Midnight Oil’s most records carry anti-colonial, anti-capitalist undertones appears lost on Wyatt. As does the fact that the lead singer of his favourite band also was a Federal Labor MP.

“Fuckk… Blue Sky Mine. Wasn’t that a good track”

When steered back to the conversation of Australian politics, Wyatt says the fact that the bourbon and cola he is drinking costs $7.50 is enough proof that this country has gone to shit.

“Mate do you know how fucking expensive it is to own two cars and a house in the outskirts of Brisbane. These Muslims aren’t fucken helping!”

Bryson says what upsets him the most is that the Southern lefties from Melbourne and New South Wales are controlling everything that happens in the world.

“Mate, they tried to make me get up earlier with daylight savings the cunts”

“How the fuck does that shit work anyway? Like you get to get off work early? Or you just have to get up earlier? I’m glad we stayed strong up here and kept the normal, Australian time”

“Anyway. Until the major parties can find a way to lower diesel prices for my cars, I’m gonna keep voting for Pauline”

The second Greens senator in two days to resign over the same issue.

“This is the height of inner-city left-wing privilege,” said Hanson, speaking to the media at Parliament House.

“They sook any carry on about everything under the sun until it concerns them. Scott is having a sook and now Larissa is having a sook. All those weekend bushwalker degenerates that infest the Green belts of the capitals are also sooking. That’s all they do is sook,”

“Well, now the cows have come home to roost.”

Addressing the media today with a man wearing a perverted scarf, Larissa Waters said it was a ‘stupid oversight’ and she apologised unreservedly for her error.

The Senator also thanked Pauline and her team for the nice cake.

“…Also, thank you to Pauline and One Nation for the cake,” she said.

“Unfortunately everybody in the Greens office in Canberra is gluten free so we had a media boy run it over to The Nationals where it was promptly demolished,”

“I hope it wasn’t laced with anything.”

Man Who Couldn’t Run A Detention Centre Without People Lighting Themselves On Fire Now In Charge Of Homeland Security

TEXT:

The Turnbull government has announced today the they will be merging together ASIO, the Australian Federal Police, Australian Border Force and other agencies to create a super agency headed by a man who was unable to run an off-shore processing centre without people lighting themselves on fire.

Despite the fact that a number of his closest Liberal party allies are believed to oppose the idea, Prime Minister Turnbull says he’s very interested in creating a system similar to Britains. The newly proposed super-department is likely to mirror the Home Office in the United Kingdom which oversees all domestic security agencies and has success rate just short of the NSW Police.

Last week while visiting the UK, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said, “We’re always very interested in learning about the British experience”.

“I think I’ve got just the guy” he said.

“Peter Dutton has learnt from the whole self-immolation thing… Nauru and Manus are being handled quite well at the moment. Hopefully, they won’t exist in a few months”

“Plus he used to be a highway cop, so he’s probably the most qualified person in Parliament when it comes to catching terrorists”

The Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS) is the overseas spy agency and is part of the Foreign Affairs Departmen and will not be moved into the super department – so as to not let Dutton touch the really shining things.

If Cabinet signs off on the changes, it is not clear hwhen any ministerial reshuffle would happen – but it would be significant enough to laugh in the face of Tony Abbott’s legacy of Border Force.

Clive Palmer debuts ‘horrifying’ face tattoo in bid to avoid employment as a company director

“Out of my way!” Palmer shouted at the growing media scrum.

When quizzed about the facial markings, which allegedly spell out ‘Devist8’ [understood to be Mr Palmer’s tag growing up], Clive said they were supposed to be intimidating.

“I need a job but at the same time, I don’t want one,” he said.

“I got these tattoos to make sure nobody would hire me as a company director so I wouldn’t have to be accountable for anything,”

“So far, it’s working.”

The Advocate reached out to various employment agencies, who were able to confirm that they’d been able to find Mr Palmer a number of roles in the diverse and exciting company director job market, but he’s turned them all down.

Disgraced Scott Ludlam Confesses To Accidentally Stealing A Pen From The Bank In 1997

Just days after the disgustingly corrupt co-deputy of the Australian Greens Party, Scott Ludlam, was forced to resign after discovering he was ineligible to hold office due to his dual-citzenship, the degenerate environmental extremist has today come forward with some even more shocking admissions.

In an unconscionable and deplorable admission to the media, Ludlam revealed this morning that he is still in possession of a ball point pen that he stole from the Bunbury National Australia Bank branch in 1997.

“What I did as a 27-year-old was a complete oversight and I apologise unreservedly”

“I understand I am not the first politician to walk out of a room full of bankers with an undeclared benefaction in my coat pocket – but I am definitely the first disgraced dual-citizen federal senator to do it”

Senator Ludlam, who was first elected to the Senate during the equally weak and conceited Kevin Rudd’s minesweeping election campaign in 2007, announced his official resignation in Perth, a place he apparently calls home, on Friday afternoon.

The Western Australian, who was born in New Zealand but left when he was a child, was recently told he remains a dual citizen with that country, meaning he was disqualified from running for office at the 2007, 2013 and 2016 elections – a reprehensible oversight that, in a truly democratic system, would render his replacement and colleagues unelectable in the future.

Malcolm Turnbull spoke briefly with British leader Theresa May to see if the British-born former Prime Minister of Australia had ever thrown his burgundy passport in the bin after it was discovered that Greens MP Scott Ludlum was still a New Zealand citizen – something that constitutionally rules him out of holding public office.

“It was worth a shot,” said Turnbull, speaking to The Advocate via Wickr.

“I mean, he’s made a lot of mistakes in the past. He might’ve still had a British passport in the junk drawer. That’s where I look when I need something like nail scissors or sticky tape,”

“Turns out he didn’t have one, which was a shame.”

Former Prime Minister Tony Abbott has told Liberal MPs that he will keep standing up for Liberals who are “feeling a bit let down and disenfranchised”  by a lack of focus on the religiously conservative issues that resulted in him being replaced by Malcolm Turnbull in the first place.

Analysts say you’d be a mug not to think that the former Prime Minister is attempting to win over enough old white men in the Liberal party to overthrow the current Prime Minister.

“Because we do not want the more traditional or conservative Liberals to leave the party and join some other party,” he said in a video obtained by the Daily Telegraph.

“Because one thing we do know is, old grey-haired no-name backbenchers definitely hold enough weight in their electorates to win another election without the backing of the Liberals”

“So of course they would definitely be thinking about it”

“This has nothing to do with the fact that I still wake up screaming when I dream about what happened on the second libspill during my eighteen months as Prime Minister”

Tony Abbott says Malcolm Turnbull is not focusing enough on climate-denying or religiously motivated policies that oppress women and gay people, because that is what the Liberal Party stands for, despite the fact the Liberal Party ousted him for paying so much attention to these issues in the first place.

“What’s all this “climate change is real” nonsense. It’s a horrible ideology”

Barnaby Orders National Voter To Follow PM At All Times As Extra Muscle Against Abbott

Deputy Prime Minister has today offered Malcolm Turnbull extra protection against his political rival and jaded predecessor Tony Abbott.

Arriving at Turnbull’s office this morning, Barnaby Joyce introduced the Prime Minister to a loyal National Party member by the name of Berrick, who has been ordered to follow the Coalition leader to every one of his public engagements in the nation’s capital over the next few months.

“Just until Abbott settles down” said Joyce.

“Malcolm, I know you’ve got your own team to help you keep this bloke from making a move, but Berrick here will put him down like a lame pony if he decides to have a crack”

Turnbull, while nervous about having a former cattle grazier with grade 8 level literacy levels following him around Parliament with a loaded shotgun, accepted Mr Joyce’s offer.

“We need to work together, now more than ever” Turnbull told Berrick.

“The last thing we want is to have this great progress we have made tackling both metropolitan and regional industrial and economic issues spoiled by a faction who believe dinosaurs only existed two thousands years ago”

This move comes after Tony Abbott claimed the Liberal Party was “haemorrhaging members”, as tensions rise over the former prime minister’s push to change the way candidates are preselected

Mr Abbott made the claim while arguing the party needed to empower its members and give them a vote in preselections.

“We’re haemorrhaging members in every state but it’s a particular problem in NSW because we’ve got this dreadful situation where we have got factionalists and lobbyists who seem to be controlling the party,” Mr Abbott told Sydney’s 2GB radio.

“Why aren’t I still Prime Minister?” he asked.

“What’s with all this unity and moderate Liberal politics? We need to be strong in our fight against abortions and state recognised gay relationships”

While on 2GB with Ray Hadley, the interview interchanged between making calculated but seemingly off-the-cuff comments about the relatively stable political party that he so badly wants to lead again, Mr Abbott was seen chewing hubba bubba gum and blowing bubbles.

“Mr Abbott please stop chewing that gum so loudly” asked a timid 2GB intern.

The Former Prime Minister was quick to respond to the request with a fart noise with his hand in his armpit.

“Make me!” he sniggered.

“I can assure you I am in no hurry to leave public life because we need strong liberal conservative voices now more than ever,” Mr Abbott said.

Christopher Pyne and Tony Abbott lock eyes from across Canberra house party dance floor

TEXT:

Although parliament broke up for holidays last week, a number of leading figures in Canberra have opted to hang around for a week and unwind.

Two of those leading figures are former prime minister Tony Abbott and his ex-friend Christopher Pyne – who happened to attend the same ANU Law Society house party in the northern suburb of Lyneham overnight.

Celebrating the end of exams, the student gathered together at Milton Hartley-Jones’ humble three-bedder on Archibald Street after a long evening of bar-hopping around Civic.

However, somewhere along the line, both Pyne and Abbott got the invite.

Speaking candidly to The Advocate about last night’s awkwardness, Christopher Pyne said running into Tony after all that happened over the weekend was ‘tough to say the least’.

“Oh my giddy Godfather it was awkward!” shrieked Pyne.

“He [Abbott] wouldn’t stop staring at me all night. There I was trying to connect with the youth and future leaders of the nation and all he could do was act like a child! Disappointing!”

“So bitchy.”

The barrel-chested South Australian Leo tried to break the ice by getting his old friend some punch from the kitchen, but when he returned to the dance floor, Abbott turned his nose up at him and slapped the styrofoam cup to the floor, soaking Pyne’s Hush Puppies in cask wine and pineapple juice.

The Advocate reached out to Mr Abbott’s office for comment but got told we’d be put in an Oodnadatta gulag the moment he topples Malcolm Turnbull.

Malcolm Roberts Jumps On Chair After Being Told The Floor Is A Rational Climate Debate

TEXT:

Senator Malcolm Roberts’ well-known interest in conspiracy theories has today been epitomised by his willingness to believe the floor of his Parliamentary office is a ‘rational debate about climate science’.

It is believed that during a rare interview with a news provider that doesn’t feature a crosshair in their website logo, Roberts was rattled by the suggestion that the floor was a sound and rational discussion about how humans are responsible for the destruction of planet earth through unsustainable industrial pollution and overpopulation.

Having met several dead ends during an interview about carbon pricing, Buzzfeed Political Editor, Mark Di Stefano made the bold decision to mislead the Senator into thinking that the floor was the rational climate debate he was trying so desperately to avoid.

“The floor is empirical data, Mr Roberts” said Di Stefano.

“It’s a rational, open-minded discussion about climate change”

Within seconds Mr Roberts is believed to have jumped on top of a random stool in the centre of his office.

“Too bad I’m not on the floor! Ah ha!” shouted Roberts.

“Take your communist de-industrialist nonsense elsewhere!”

“Now, lets talk about Muslims”

Mr Roberts was next seen hanging from the curtains on his office windows after being told the stool was an admission that not all Muslims are terrorists.

Pyne Politely Informs Abbott That Everyone’s Kind Of Moved On From The Religious Stuff

TEXT:

Former Prime Minister Tony Abbott is looking more and more likely to become the newest candidate of fellow Liberal Party outsider Cory Bernardi’s new political movement, The Australian Conservatives.

This comes after Turnbull’s executioner, Christopher Pyne MP, was seen relaying orders from the the ruling Liberal’s progressive faction.

“Tony, you are a valued member. But until you drop this anti-gay-marriage-anti-science stance, you can’t sit with us” he said.

“Go and sit with Bernardi if you want. But you aren’t making any friends with this 2GB shit”

Once loyal to Abbott, Christopher Pyne has in recent years steered away from the ‘cuckservative’ model of Liberal politics, especially after witnessing the Member for Warringah’s countless efforts to sabotage marriage equality in Australia, despite having a gay sister himself.

“It’s ahh. You don’t get it… ahhh” said Abbott.

“My voters… Andrew Bolt.. They…. You don’t get it”

Christopher Pyne responded to the stumbling former Prime Minister by pointing out his sugar-hit populism is in no way in line with the contemporary Liberal Party of Australia.

“You’re not saying anything, Tony”

“Stop talking about climate change like it’s nothing more than a back pocket expense for Australian voters”

“Your constituents don’t know what a back pocket expense is anymore, unless their houses are being eroded off the banks of the Northern Beaches, they don’t need to worry about climate change”

Tony Abbott was last seen pacing around Parliament House complaining about the ABC.

Pauline Hanson is reportedly showing no sympathy for Abbott, after the part he played in her 18 month stint in prison in 2003.

Pauline Almost Out Of Minorities To Rip On After Giving It To Those Pesky Autistic Kids

TEXT:

Pauline Hanson is reportedly researching madly into different ethnic communities within Australia that she might be able to criticse next, after running low on people to discriminate against.

This comes after her most recent comments about Australian children with autism.

Students with disabilities should be removed from mainstream classrooms because they are putting a strain on teachers and schools, One Nation Senator Pauline Hanson has told parliament.

“If there is a number of them, these children should go into a special classroom and be… given that special attention because most of the time the teachers spend so much time on them.” she said.

“I’ll get back to Muslims next weeks but for the time being, I’ve got my laser on autistic kids”

However, Hanson and her staffers are aware that if she doesn’t look towards a new demographic of Australians that most people haven’t got much to do with, she’ll be unable make enough headlines to be sitting at the back of the voter’s minds when they walk into the ballot against their will.

“I’m thinking Nepalese kitchen staff could be a good one. Why are all the good schnitzel jobs going to Nepalese people”

“Everyday Australians are sick and tired of having their schnitzels made by someone who doesn’t speak very good English”

“I could go back to Vietnamese and Chinese again, but that was so 1990s” she said.

Origin II: Pauline Hanson Frustrated By Complex Islander Last Names In QLD Side

TEXT:

With the NRL State Of Origin Match just around the corner, it appears that not everyone in the Sunshine State is happy with the modern game – even after an 80% win rate over the last decade.

While resting her pale feet on a gas heater in Parliament house today, One Nation leader Pauline Hanson has been recorded unsuccessfully attempting to pronounce the last name of Queensland number five, Dane Gagai.

After several cracks at it, she resorted to identifying him by his skin colour, before talking about the good old days when footballers had easier names to pronounce – like Adam Mogg and Kerrod Walters.

“It all started with that big copper from West End. What was his name? Muninger? Meninga?”

“Queenslanders used to have normal Aussie names untill he came along – and for what?”

“Now we’ve got names like Gayguy, Papallus, and Munster”

“Whatever happened to the good old days. Back when they had Aussie names like Schifcofske”

When asked if she thought that maybe the influx of Aboriginal and Polynesian players in the Queensland talent pool might be responsible for the record-breaking eight-in-a-row series streak, Hanson said she’s not interested in the stats and research from “so-called-experts”.

“I just want Australia to go back to the way it was in my faint memories and misplaced nostalgia”

PM Promises He’ll Get Back To The Gay Marriage Thing When Adani Is Up And Running

TEXT:

Australian Prime Minister and former supporter of marriage equality, Malcolm Turnbull, has today promised Australia’s gay population – most of whom live in his own electorate – that he hasn’t forgotten about their dreams of being considered worthy of marriage.

In April, Turnbull joined a long list of Australian state and federal politicians who have personally met with Indian mining billionaire Guatam Adani in a desperate plea for him to privatise the coal currently sitting adjacent to Australia’s Great Barrier Reef in central Queensland.

“It’s nearly there” he said.

“Once it’s up and running and shipping coal back to India, we can focus on the previously promised human rights amendments, and you can focus on yourselves instead of looking after this reef”

“In fact, if you could help get the other lefties off my back about coral bleaching we’d be able to get to your needs much sooner”

Last month it was reported that the future of Australia’s biggest mining project was in doubt after the Queensland Government decided not to facilitate a potential $900 million federal loan from Turnbull’s government.

Indian coal miner Adani’s proposed multi-billion-dollar Carmichael coal mine in remote central Queensland would consist of six open-cut pits and up to five underground mines that would supply Indian power plants for less than half the cost Australians would pay for it.

“Unfortunately this is usually the case. Our government gets so caught up in creating a few thousand jobs for a tax-avoiding international corporation and our environment and human rights get made to wait” said Turnbull.

“I don’t know if the reef will survive this whole thing, but surely you lot [the gays] will”

Dutton Made To Clean Dishes In Parliament Kitchen To Make Up For $70M Manus Payout

TEXT:

After years of denying that life for detainees in Manus Island is anything but peachy, Immigration Minister has today been left red-faced.

This comes as the Australian government was been forced to pay $70 million in compensation to more than 1900 asylum seekers detained at Manus Island in a landmark deal thought to be Australia’s largest-ever human rights-related settlement.

Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has today ordered that Peter Dutton roll up his sleeves and start paying the money back through a night job in the Parliament House kitchen, after years of insisting that the self-immolation happening in Island Detention centres was only the fault of the detainees.

Peter Dutton, who has only ever worked for the public service was reportedly disgusted by the Prime Minister’s suggestion that he work a real job as a way of paying back the $70m that Australian tax payers have just been stung with for human rights violations under his watch.

“It’s not my fault” he whined to Malcolm Turnbull.

“This all because of ambulance-chasing law firms that reckon asylum seekers deserve the same human rights as asylum-holders”

With the weekly wage of kitchenhands currently sitting just above minimum, at $694.90, it is looks as though Dutton will have to hold this job for another 193 years, that is unless he finds a way to blame labor for the atrocious treatment of refugees in Australian Government sanctioned island prisons.

Abbott Begins Sending Condolences To 15% Of His Electorate

TEXT:

A defeated Former Prime Minister Tony Abbott has slinked back to his office this afternoon to begin sending apologies to the 15% of his electorate who agreed it’s his stance on gay marriage.

With the same-sex marriage bill passing through the lower house only minutes ago, the devout Catholic says he’s sorry he couldn’t do more to make 62% of Australia agree with his outdated definition of matrimony.

Abbott is still certain that he is the only recent Prime Minister that represents the ‘real Australians’, after an 82-year-old lady that lives two kilometres from his family home in the affluent North Shore of Sydney sent him an email telling him exactly that.

“Keep up the good work Anthony. I wish you were still in charge and doing something about those (sic) Moslems and Homosexuals” read the letter.

“I agree with everything you say. I remember seeing you play rugby when you were younger. You always were a good leader even with blacks in your team. Much love, Beryl”

It is believed that Mr Abbott read Beryl’s email, which had been transcribed to the internet by her live-at-home nurse Sucheta, shortly before his confident appearing on conservative talkback radio 2GB this morning to deliver yet another tirade vaguely targeting his sworn enemy, party leader Malcolm Turnbull.

The former Prime Minister says British Conservative Prime Minister Teresa May’s disastrous UK election result should be a warning sign for Australian Liberals that they’ll come “unstuck” if they don’t listen to voters.

The man who thought Australian’s would prefer to knight Prince Philip over Richie Benaud also predicted that Labor leader Bill Shorten would win the next election if Mr Turnbull didn’t make the right calls.

“Stop talking about the environment. Stop giving Muslims a chance to distance themselves from Terrorists. Stop pushing policies that wealthy old religious people don’t care about” he said.

“Everyday Australians, like the multi-millionaire that sent me and email this morning, are feeling detached from politicians“

Pauline Says Incriminating Voice Recordings Obtained By ABC Just Typical Leftie Bias

TEXT:

Just days after she called on Malcolm Turnbull to slash funding to the Australian public broadcaster,  lawyers for One Nation leader Pauline Hanson are in court attempting to gag the ABC to prevent more secret recordings made by former party treasurer Ian Nelson becoming public.

Senator Hanson has lodged an injunction in the NSW Supreme Court which seeks to stop the ABC from broadcasting more covert material that makes her look like an unsavoury character, in her quest to bash migrant communities all the way to Prime Ministership.

“Whatever comes out is just leftie rubbish,” said Pauline.

“They have an agenda to present facts in a way that makes me look bad”

“These voice recordings are none of their business. That’s why I’m trying to stop them from leaking them because it’s just propaganda to make their Islam-loving communist mates happy”

The injunction comes one week after the ABC’s 7.30 program revealed a secretly recorded phone conversation between Senator Hanson and an ex-party member where Senator Hanson appeared worried that a controversy might become a controversy because she did something controversial and the ABC found out about it.

“Just don’t listen to them” she told a rally of jaded voters in a working class town that has been rocked by her decision to slash penalty wages this morning.

“Halal! Lefties! Gays!”

Mrs Hanson continued to shout conservative buzzwords until the crowd began roaring in her favour.

The recently-resigned Ipswich mayor Paul Pisasale was allegedly stopped by police at an interstate airport with $50,000 in a bag a couple months back, just weeks before he fronted a press conference in his pyjamas and dressing gown to announce his career change.

Malcolm Turnbull Unable To Disprove Noel Pearson’s Claim That He Is A White C*nt

TEXT:

Indigenous leader Noel Pearson need not worry about being called a liar or worse, a defamer, after he was alleged to have called Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull a “white cunt” in what one witness described as an offensive tirade outside the Prime Minister’s office

Pearson, a notoriously hot-tempered black academic, is also believed to have referred to Indigenous Minister Ken Wyatt as a “black cunt” and Indigenous Labor senator Pat Dodson as a “fucking black cunt”.

Speaking to the media today, Turnbull says he thinks while Pearson could have expressed himself a bit more eloquently, technically he is correct.

“As far as I know, I don’t have any Aboriginal heritage. Neither does Lucy… So no one in my family is Indigenous” he said.

“Noel was correct in calling me white – as I am a white man”

“…and I’m a politician too, so the second word he used is pretty fair as well, I guess”

Conservative commentators around the country are distraught today, upon learning that Pearson also referred to black politicians as black cunts, and therefore they are unable to claim that his tirade is a perfect example of how black people can be racist to white people too.

Barnaby Says Key To Buying Home Is Moving Somewhere Shit And Changing Entire Career

TEXT:

Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce has suggested Australians who are opting for “incredibly expensive” homes because they want to live within 100 kilometres of a central business district, and to work in careers that can only be sustained by living within 100 kilometres of a central business district.

The Nationals leader told ABC RN Drive that those who cannot afford a home in Sydney or Melbourne should consider moving to much shitter areas, where it is cheaper to buy property.

Mr Joyce made his provocative comments after being questioned about a new survey which rates Sydney’s housing as less affordable than New York or London and whether the Government was doing enough to address the issue.

“The thing is, if you want to live in Sydney as a first home buyer – you need to be rocking two $100,000 plus incomes”

“So technically, you can only be a first home buyer in Sydney if you married with no kids and on a wage higher than majority of Australians under 35 are on”

The Minister For Agriculture went on to point out that living in the city is simply unsustainable for young people, unless someone does something about the fact that the average wages for people under 35 have only increased 3% in the last 30 years – and need to be scaled accordingly Australians over 50 enjoy an averaged wag increase of over 30%, which isn’t going to happen.

“Entering the housing market is easy. Just give up on having a job in finance, media, law, town planning, state services or anything else that would require you to be in a city”

“There’s plenty of rehab and counselling jobs going in Bourke right now, why would anyone be wanting to work as a nurse or paramedic in Sydney right now”

Joyce has advised young Australians to pick between working in education, agribusiness or mining – that’s if they want to own a home and be able to get to work in under 2 hours each day.

“We’ve got plenty of jobs in Boggabilla, plenty in Wilcannia. Why does everyone feel the need to live in metropolitan areas with more than four types of occupations”

“Our state governments have made it clear that they aren’t interesting in stemming the flow of overseas investors into our cities vacant apartment buildings, so this is your only option”

“Please don’t stop eating smashed avocado, though. Avocado farmers are some of my safest constituents”

Refugees Now Required To Provide 3 Phone Numbers Of Warlords That Tried To Kill Them

TEXT:

Immigration Minister Peter Dutton has given 7,500 asylum seekers living in Australia until October to learn English, get their heads around the highly-bureaucratic immigration department and lodge an application for protection in our country from whatever tyrannical governments or environmental disasters that threaten their lives elsewhere.

If unable to do so, they will face deportation, as the former Brisbane policeman declares the “game is up” for “fake refugees”.

Mr Dutton said the asylum seekers had all arrived by boat under the previous Labor governments, most without identity documents, and had so far either failed to present their case for asylum with the Immigration Department.

“I’m using this as not only an opportunity to appeal to people who think war-weary refugees will effect their way of life, but it’s also a good chance to rip into other political parties who threaten my job” said the man who boycotted the national apology to the Stolen Generations.

“If people think they can rip the Australian taxpayer off, if people think that they can con the Australian taxpayer, then I’m sorry, the game’s up,” he said.

From now on, refugees and Asylum seekers hoping to remain in Australia must provide government agencies with at least three phone numbers references who can clarify that they would murder the applicant if he or she were to return home.

Pauline Waiting For Boring Budget Stuff To Wrap Up Before She Rips Into Muslims Again

The One Nation party leader has today revealed that although she does believe the mainstream media is avoiding her, she has actually made an effort to not bother talking about the Medicare levy increase to fund the hyper-expensive NDIS, as well as the new taxes directed at Australia’s big banks.

“The Budget is boring” she said.

“Everyday Australians don’t care about things that don’t trigger an immediate emotional response”

“People feel out of touch with the whole ‘politics’ thing, stop pandering to the minorities of economic advisors and strategists and start focusing on real issues, people who don’t look us”

It is believed the refugees told the Federal Government they were at risk of execution in Iran

Mr Dutton wanted the men deported, along with four others, but the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT), which reviews decisions made by Federal Government ministers, departments and agencies, blocked the bid – mainly because it looked a lot like Dutton was signing off an execution.

“If you are dumb and throw shit in a skip for a living, you probably won’t be my neighbour any time soon. But yeah, back to what I was saying. I got all up in this shit by drinking instant coffee.”

Family from South Australia about to discover what the Proceeds of Crime Act is

TEXT:

The Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 establishes a scheme to confiscate proceeds of crime and provides the means for returning the benefits of those confiscated funds to the community – here and abroad.

Network Nine has reportedly paid a large sum of money to the family of imprisoned Australian Cassandra Sainsbury, who is currently awaiting trial in Colombia for allegedly attempting to smuggle over 6kg of cocaine out of the South American nation to Australia via Great Britain.

However, should the 22-year-old be convicted of the crime, any and all proceeds of that crime may be seized by the Commonwealth under the Proceeds of Crime Act.

The Advocate reached out to the Attorney-General’s office for comment, but was told to come back once George Brandis had finished his smoked salmon and sweet chilli Philly breakfast bagel.

Arriving at Mr Brandis’ Canberra office this morning, he explained to us that the family should become familiar with the Act prior to cashing in on Cassandra’s misfortune.

“By the time we get to the jet skis, they’ve been flogged so hard that it’s difficult to recoup the money. This looks like a case that’ll take a while to pan out so we expect the jet skis to be utterly fucked by the time we seize them,” he said.

“But yeah [coughs] it’s a delicate situation. I’d recommend not going to ham on the media deals. It’ll be a long trial if she pleads not guilty. Honestly though, it’s too early to comment.”

Mr Brandis then burped and got up out of his seat before laying down on the ottoman at the other side of the room and told The Advocate to come back later.

Richard Di Natale labels Scott Morrison a ‘typical Taurus’ in speech to Senate

TEXT:

Greens leader Richard Di Natale has referred to the Treasuer as a ‘typical Taurus’ this afternoon during a speech to the Senate in response to this week’s federal budget.

Scott Morrison’s second budget has received mixed reviews, mostly from the overprivileged educated left, while other more sensible commentators have also been left scratching their heads.

Describing the fiscal policy outlined by the Cronulla bible thumper as ‘bullish’ and ‘aggressive,’ Di Natale rolled his eyes a number of times during the speech, which also took aim at some of his Senate colleagues.

“I mean, hello,” said Di Natalie. “He’s [Morrison] such a typical Taurus. Like a bull in a china shop. So dumb! God, there’s so much stuff he’s left out and so much stuff he’s given too much to. Bullish, aggressive budget! Sad!”

However, Morrison hit back a short time later.

The 48-year-old suggestws that perhaps the Greens leave ‘the big boy politics’ to the ‘big boys’ and to ‘leave his crystals and zodiac medicine back in the rainforest where it belongs.’

“Yeah, look. We can’t all run around kissing hands and shaking babies like the Greens do,” said Morrison.

“I am a fucking Taurus and I love being one. But grow up cunt. Don’t bring that shit into Parliament. ”

George Christensen horrifies parliament by biting into Kit-Kat

TEXT:

Federal MP George Christensen has reportedly mortified a number of his parliamentary colleagues today by biting into a Kit-Kat instead of snapping the fingers off one-by-one as regular folk do.

The Member for Dawson came under fire for the act, which saw Bob Katter stand up and walk out in utter disgust.

Christensen also copped flack from across the floor.

Labor frontbencher Anthony Albanese swore audibly while Tanya Plibersek got up and tried to throw a condensed version of the Constitution of Australia at Christensen before being stopped by the Serjeant-at-Arms.

“How can he [Christensen] just sit there and do that?” said Katter, who took a moment to compose himself outside the parliamentary chamber.

“You’d end up receiving CPR if you tried to do that in Charters Towers. He should know better. He should resign! There should be an investigation! Wait here, I’ll be back.”

The Advocate reached out to Mr Christensen for comment, who promptly responded with a prepared and articulate letter.

“If you don’t like the way I eat Kit-Kats, then you can go and get fucked,” wrote the Mackay-native.

“Seriously, there was a budget last night. Scott Morrison has shit the bed. Typical Protestant kneejerk rock’n’roll hymn bullshit. Scott Morrison should go to Captain Snooze tonight and pick up a new bed. Can’t you report on things that people care about?”

Liberal Staffer Proposes Drug Testing People In The Housos While Microwaving An Empty Plate

TEXT:

Prime Minister Scott Morrison has revealed a new plan that would see welfare recipients required to undergo drug testing, with those who test positive to be forced onto a Centrelink income-management scheme, which controls how a recipient spends their money.

Local poverty-stricken drug user, Blake Austron (30) – who smokes marijuana as a cheap, dosile alternative to alcohol that helps to take the pain away from the trauma he carries from a childhood of horrific abuse – says not having access to his welfare payments is just the right amount of empowerment needed to get him out of the housos.

“I just need to be restricted from making my own adult decisions,” he says.

“I know the budget will be criticised heavily, but people should know that these career public servants in Canberra do actually know what’s best for the downtrodden”

“I think allowing my mental health problems to take complete control of my life is what’s best for me right now”

However, while the government has been criticised for the imminent recession, local liberal staffer, Wyatt Andrich (22) says it couldn’t possibly be because of the proposed drug testing program for Centrelink customers.

“It’s going to poll really well in the suburbs” says Mr Andrich, while erratically wiping his nose and giggling at mundane comments.

“The poor people drugs aren’t popular with Joe six-pack in the homeland suburbs Weed, ice… even tobacco. It’s a popular thing to hate”

“That’s why we are only testing for weed and ice”

After briefly pausing the interview to use the bathroom, Mr Andrich returned to say to that welfare management has worked very well in other parts of the world.

“Just look at post-war Queensland”

“We wouldn’t have half the infrastructure we have up there if the Pacific islander were being paid in cash”

When asked if possibly testing other recipients of tax payer salaries for ilicit substances was also something to consider, Mr Andrich says there’s no point and that it doesn’t make sense and why bother.

“Seriously! Why bother!?” he says loudly.

“[sniffs] It’s too much work. It doesn’t make sense”

“It’s the welfare recipients that need to be tested”

Our interview then ended, following the ‘ding’ of the microwave in Wyatt’s kitchen.

“Alright. You lot can get out of here now” yells Wyatt, while retrieving an empty white plate with a tea towel.

“Our boys!” he shouts to his colleagues currently smoking ciggies out the back.

“We’re on here”

Senator Roberts Calls For Royal Commission Into Whether Or Not Blue Tap Is Actually Colder

TEXT:

For the sixth time since he first entered the senate, One Nation Senator Malcolm Roberts has today called for a Royal Commission into a mundane issue he has regarding day-to-day Australian life.

“I’ve done a lot of research into this” he said today. “

“I went looking into the agencies that have been spreading this temperature myth. I started finding out things about the CSIRO and Bureau of Meteorology. That led me then to the UN, which has been driving this. Then I started following the money trails.”

He went on to explain that they could be traced back to a few families who are making “trillions” of dollars over the myth that the blue button on office water coolers actually makes the water colder.

When One Nation announced its policies for this year, an attack on climate science was strangely prominent – as well as white collar elitism – like water cooler lies.

This joins their call for a “royal commission to determine if Islam is a religion or political ideology”  – and “a royal commission (or similar) into the corruption of climate science”.

“I’m sick of the lies” he said.

“Every day people are sick of being lied to and made to feel stupid for wanting to talk about these things”

Labor Hires Hundreds Of New Staffers To Scour Liberal Policies For Something They Can Oppose

TEXT:

Following his silence on countless controversial political issues such as the medical evacuation of Nauru, climate change and encryption laws, Bill Shorten has taken extra steps this week to find some Government policies that he actually disagrees with – or at least, had no part in creating.

Shorten has gone ahead and hired 140 new staffers to plough through thousands of pages of Liberal policy, until they can find something that he would be able to front a press conference with.

“It needs to be something that I can take the higher ground on” he said.

“At this point it’s hard to take the higher ‘progressive’ ground on anything”

“Like, sure Adani is going to fuck the reef, but we need to look like we support Aussie jobs – even if those jobs ruin other jobs, like tourism jobs”

It is believed that while Shorten is very quick to condemn anything that looks like racism, he was suspiciously tight-lipped last month after Dutton told him that private messenger platforms are not in the national interest.

The leader of the opposition says it’s really hard to condemn something that you’ve essentially been trying to use as political leverage.

“Like, the whole fucking penalty rates thing. That was the last time I was able to call them rich and out of touch… and only just”

“The Fair Work Commission was our thing, and they gave them exactly what he wanted”

“Same with the gay marriage thing. Do you know how hard it is to justify dumping a marriage equality plebiscite on the grounds of how much you support marriage equality?”

“Nauru and Manus would be a white whale if Rudd hadn’t introduced the fucking things”

Man from the country goes on Q&A – what happened next won’t shock you

TEXT:

A prominent regional Australian went on popular ABC program Q&A last night, where his political and social stance on a smorgasbord of issues was openly mocked and ridiculed by a team of soft-left commentators.

The Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce revealed to The Advocate late last night that he’s only just finished taking the words out of his mouth that ABC presenter Tony Jones was trying to put in there last night.

Speaking candidly, Joyce said he doesn’t really like visiting the Ultimo Kremlin, put somebody in his party has to.

“You know, it’s just something you need to do when you’re the D-PM, you have to talk to people who don’t like you,” said Joyce as he unwound last night over a few News in the pokie room of the Pyrmont Bridge Hotel.

“Look, I’ve got nothing against Tony and what he stands for. This country needs Chardonnay socialists with dead fish handshakes just as much as it needs anyone else. But yeah, I kinda knew I was going to get a bit of a bashing last night, but fuck it. I don’t care. I don’t think anyone was surprised with Tony’s conduct last night.”

However, a number of prominent ABC lifers hit back at Joyce’s remarks, calling them ‘out of touch’ and ‘inflammatory’.

Q&A host Tony Jones spoke to The Advocate a short time ago to explain that Joyce doesn’t know what he’s talking about.

“Oh my God, every time we have somebody from the country on my show, it always ends like this,” said a cross-legged Jones.

“But I get that the farmers are important and so on like ‘hashtag thank a farmer’ blah blah blah but can they really be that backwards? Perhaps it’s the lack of fluoride in their rainwater tanks but their way of life is starting to affect us Balmain folk now. The climate is ruined. I hope Barnaby knows that!”

Dutton Disputes Media Theory That Detained Refugee Offspring Also Called ‘Children’

TEXT:

Peter Dutton has demanded an apology from the media for their reporting on the demographics of inmates currently detained in The Manus Regional Processing Centre.

The Minister for Immigration says that journalists had “morphed into advocates” and “lost control of any dispassionate view of this circumstance” by using terms like ‘kids’ and ‘children’ to describe detainees under the age of 13.

Dutton said the ABC and Fairfax Media, among others, had relied on the testimony of Papua New Guinean politicians and police as authorities on the best words to use when describing young humans currently caged in one of two offshore Australian immigration detention facilities, located on Los Negros Island in Manus Province, Papua New Guinea.

When asked by Insiders host Barry Cassidy what he had been referring to non-adult detainees as, Dutton appeared perplexed.

“I don’t know, mate… Pups? Calves? I’m not sure. It’s not exactly my job to be up to date with every cultural nuance of these people”

“I thought they automatically become Papua New Guineans if they were born there.”

“Either way, the ABC’s irresponsible use of words like ‘kids’ and ‘children’ gives off the wrong impression”

Turnbull Mocks Westpac CEO With Chicken Noises After Bank Pulls Out Of Adani Mine

TEXT:

Malcolm Turnbull has fronted the Australian media today to explain the newest hurdle towards building the controversail Adani mine in the Queensland Galilee Basin.

“I just want everyone to know, that the 1500 jobs I was hoping to use a leverage to keep Abbott out the top job has met some obstacles” he said this morning.

“Through no fault of mine, or my few remaining ministers who want to listen to me, the investors in this mine have pulled the pin”

Turnbull said that Westpac has effectively ruled out financing Indian-owned Adani Group’s giant coal mine in  under a new climate change policy – after weighing up the pros and cons of being directly responsible for destroying the Great Barrier Reef and Artesian water basin in one short-lived fossil fuel extraction project.

The bank’s “new climate change position statement and action plan” restricts lending to projects which use “the highest quality coal in advanced power generation technologies”.

The decision has resulted in snide remarks from several Federal MPs, with Resources Minister Matt Canavan describing Westpac as a pack of “wimps”.

“Corporations are wimps these days in standing up up these pot-smoking coral-huggers” Senator Canavan told a press conference shortly after Westpac released its policy..

“It is disappointing Westpac has made this decision without consultation with the people of northern Queensland – who don’t really know what is going on and keep getting promised the world by a rapidly rotating stream of Prime Ministerships and tax-avoiding fossil fuel companies.

Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull says he agrees with Caravan’s comments and began making chicken noises during his address on Facebook live this morning.

“Buk buk bigurk” he said, to suggest that CEO of Westpac is too chicken to fuck around with the environment.

“[Brian] Hartzer is such a pussy”

“Who cares about the reef bleaching. Who cares about the potential risks of draining and poisoning the Artesian… Australians want to see progress!”

“And as we all know, the surest sign of progress is giant plumes of smoke going into the air and heating up the planet”

PC GONE MAD: “If We’re Not Allowed To Kidnap Aboriginal Kids, What Can We Do?”

TEXT:

One Nation has lost yet another candidate for the next Queensland election, after former policeman Mark Ellis announced he is no longer standing due to outrage over his role in a child abduction case in the 1990s.

Mr Ellis, who was endorsed to contest the Logan seat of Macalister, announced his withdrawal on his Facebook page on Wednesday, after being criticised for being member of the “Pinkenba Six”.

Mr Ellis was one of six police officers charged in 1994 with kidnapping three Indigenous youths from Brisbane’s Fortitude Valley and leaving them 12km away in Pinkenba.

One Nation leader and federal senator, Pauline Hanson is yet to condemn the act of abducting Aboriginal children and threatening to cut their fingers off and demanding they strip their clothes off, however she has taken shots at the media reporting on the issue.

“It’s just PC gone mad” she said in her monotone grandmotherly voice.

“Mark was perfect for One Nation, but the leftie media think his track record of mowing swastikas into his lawn and threatening to murder female coworkers is just soooo important”

“As for the abducting Aboriginal children, technically that’s not even politically incorrect”

“Haven’t you watched Rabbit-Proof-Fence? Our government used to be made up of people who enjoyed abducting Aboriginal kids.”

“Mr Ellis is an old fashioned Aussie. He would have made a great contribution towards making Australia great again”

The fact that Mark Ellis had to in fact sack himself has left Australians increasingly nervous about how bad someone would have to fuck up in order to get unendorsed by Pauline Hanson.

Malcolm Roberts lashes out at spherical depiction of Earth; prefers wall maps

TEXT:

One Nation Senator and champion of empirical science Malcolm Roberts was livid yesterday as numerous depictions of the Earth as a round circular globe were on display across the planet.

Yesterday saw many come to together for Earth Day and the coinciding Marches for Science.

However, Roberts has hit out at the organisers of the events for depicting the earth as a globe.

“It’s just plain wrong. There is not empirical evidence to suggest that the Earth is round. People are still relying on some guy’s account of sailing across it in the 1500’s or whatever,” he said.  

“Those loony communist crazy greens and their ‘Climate Change Cult’ have tried to pull the wool over people’s eyes about this and I simply won’t have it. I am a man of science and I will be taking this debate on.”

When shown footage of NSW Greens MP Jeremy ‘Stagecoach’ Buckingham standing next to an inflated Earth on Cronulla Beach, the One Nation firebrand began twitching.

“Down in Cronulla they should know better. They are good honest people down there and shouldn’t be indulging this sort of stuff,” Roberts said.

“Tell me, if the earth is Round, how come you can go to Antarctica and not fall off?” he asked.

“And don’t get me started on this March for Science stuff, it’s just ridiculous.”

Despite not having any vested interest in combatting climate change other than the future of the human race and the offspring, Roberts says all these people are using alternative facts to promote a crazy left wing agenda.

Pauline Says Turnbull Should Cancel More Than Just Four Hundred And Fifty-Seven Visas

TEXT:

Following the news that the Federal Government has today announced their plans to abolish the 457 visa and replace it with two new visas – One Nation leader Pauline Hanson has come out swinging saying that “cancelling only four hundred and fifty-seven visas is not nearly enough”

“And he’s technically only cancelling four hundred and fifty-five visas if he’s going to introduce two new ones straight after” Pauline Hanson roared.

“I don’t care if the only reason you did this was to appease me and my senators. Four hundred and fifty seven is soft”

Turnbull’s proposed scheme means Australians will get first priority when it comes to jobs that have been filled by international workers that were brought in because there was a deficit in Australians with those skillsets.

Mr Turnbull said the new system would be “manifestly, rigorously, resolutely conducted in the national interest”.

Pauline says she doesn’t know what any of those words mean and she’s not interested in learning what they mean. She says that people voted for her on the basis that there would be no one else coming into this country and 457 quite frankly isn’t enough action.

Turnbull solves 457 visa problem by turning it off and on again

TEXT:

Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has announced he is scrapping the heavily-debated 457 visa program for skilled migrants as part of a bid to tackle unemployment – and replacing it with a similar, but entirely different scheme.

“I have solved the program,” said Turnbull.

“It is no longer an issue.”

In a statement delivered to the internet just a short time ago, the PM remarked that he was “putting Australian jobs first” and “tackling unemployment head-on” in tearing up the policy.

“In one foul swoop, I’ve managed to appease the bible-thumpers and racists by scrapping the 457 visa and I’ve also got the unions pissing in my pocket. I’m a genius. All I did was turn it off and on again.”

The visa program tipped to replace the old 457 system is set to be almost exactly the same as it with a few choice modifications.

Stopping short of asking Immigration Minister Peter Dutton to speak today, Turnbull agreed that it’s pretty much business as usual, just now prospective skilled migrants “need to be a bit better at English”.

“[Peter] Dutton wanted us to include a skin pigment shade test for the new program, but we had to draw a line somewhere. Even George [Christensen] thought that was a bit crook,”

“So yeah, I guess we can put this one to bed then.”

Privately Educated North Shore Bible Basher Worried Politicians Are Out Of Touch With Aussies

Abbott, who has worked in Canberra since he was in his 20s, and was ousted from the top job nearly two years ago after he thought it would be a good idea to knight Queen Elizabeth’s husband instead of the late Richie Benaud, says Australians feel detached.

He has has warned that he picked up an expectation that Opposition Leader Bill Shorten could soon be installed as prime minister, and says his sworn enemy Malcolm Turnbull should be not underestimate the power of jaded backbenchers like him, who will literally oust leaders every six months if it means they can stay on $200k a year without having do much other than yell ‘shame’ during question time.

Mr Abbott, who is the real deal and well-known for how appropriate his language is around women and his ability to relate to people who aren’t born into an affluent Northern Sydney surf club community, says to retain power and please the public his party who hate him must reform the Senate; stop putting renewable energy before the pussy arse environment; dump the Human Rights Commission and stop using big words.

Fourth Grader Skips Training Using Dead Grandparent Excuse For The Fifth Time

Over the course of the past year, Betoota Dolphin’s fourth grade flanker Stanley Park has tragically lost five grandparents.

Their deaths have prevented him from attending four training sessions and one Saturday game fixture last August against perennial easy beats, the Boulia John Player Specials.

“I can’t believe it,” said the 23-year-old scrummager.

“Grandpa Peter was so fit and healthy last time I saw him. I can’t believe he’s gone. That’s it now, I’m grandparent-less now. My genes must be no good, sad face emoticon.”

However, not everybody in his club has undiagnosed post-concussion syndrome – leading a few inquisitive club heroes to question the veracity of this latest death.

“I count three grandfathers and two grandmothers,” said club treasurer Mick Stockwell.

“Not that it matters, but one of them could’ve been a pot of hummus. Controversial for his day. That or his grandmother remarried. Either way, I don’t see why there’d be a period of mourning for either,”

“Club bylaws dictate that a player can only miss a training session or game for the death of an immediate or blood relative. We’ll get to the bottom of it.”

Excited Palaszczuk Reveals Reef Nearly Dead Enough For Coal Ships To Crush Through

TEXT:

An ecstatic Annastacia Palaszczuk has today revealed that continued coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef is nearly at the point where coal ships would be able to crush their way through to the Central Queensland coast with enough momentum.

Speaking to media this morning, the Queensland Premier said the current bleaching episode is great news for the proposed Adani Megamine in the Galilee basin.

“This bleaching, while not as attractive to overseas visitors, has a major silver lining to it… Or should I say… a coal lining [laughter]”

“The death of the top the thirds of the reef could see international and domestic visitors to the region plummet by more than a million people a year – making way for an endless stream Indian shipping vessels exporting Australian coal back to the subcontinent for a song.”

The mine has drawn immense controversy about its claimed economic benefits, its financial viability, plans for government subsidy and the damaging environmental impacts. Broadly, these have been described as its direct impact upon the Great Barrier Reef, groundwater at its site and its carbon emissions.

However, Premier Palaszczuk says she is much more concerned about the current political climate than she is about the climate climate.

“I know that we probably could save this million year old natural wonder of the world, if we wanted to focus on cutting carbon emissions in that part of the world. But to be honest, that’s not the biggest issue we have on hand”

“If we don’t blindly promise 1400 jobs for the next 60 years in some fuckhole town that no one is going to be living in anyway, Pauline will win every seat in Queensland”

“I’m sorry, but when put up against my job, salary and political legacy, the reef isn’t that important”

“Not to mention the money that will be made when we can finally drive ships through it”

Governor-General Turns Sickly Grey During Handshake With Offshore Dementor

TEXT:

Governor-General Peter Cosgrove has experienced the horrid feeling of his soul being consumed upon, after shaking hands with a gliding, wraith-like dark creature employed by the Australian Ministry of Immigration as the guard of Nauru Prison.

The Minister, who originates from the Division of Dickson, has been in the role of Dementor for the Ministry of Immigration since 21 December 2014, after He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named (Tony Abbott) was sighted in the Ministry, and Dutton’s defection to the Dark Lord’s cause became undeniable.

Following the news last month that Peter Dutton MP had divided his soul in to seven horcruxes ahead of a possible coalition leadership spill, spurred on by NewsLimited, it seems even the Australian Head Of State is vulnerable to the Dementor’s Kiss.

The Dementor’s Kiss is the act of a Dementor sucking out a person’s soul. It was sometimes used as a sentence for criminals by the Ministry of Immigration, and is considered a fate worse than death.

Governor-General Peter Cosgrove was noticeably rattled as Dutton began feeding off his soul in a way that is usually reserved for illegal immigrants and asylum seekers who find themselves within the walls of Nauru.

“He was aware that his soul was being torn from him the moment he touched the Dementor’s hand” said one aide.

“He was quick to wrap up the handshake before he ended up in a vegetative state”

As described in popular British folklore, Dementors feed upon human happiness, and thus cause depression and despair to anyone near them. They can also consume a person’s soul, leaving their victims in a permanent vegetative state and thus are often referred to as “soul-sucking fiends“. They are known to leave a person as an ’empty-shell’ which can sometimes result in self-immolation.

As was discovered underneath the Rudd Ministry, Dementors hold no true loyalty, except to whomever can provide them with the most people to feed off.

Peter Dutton has responded to the allegations that he was attempting a ‘Dementor’s Kiss’ on the Governer-General. He says it is so typical of the lefty media to use the handshake as an opportunity to push their pro-LGBTI, anti-self-immolation agenda.

“Wtf is a Demetors kiss?” he posted to twitter.

“Sounds gay as”

One Nation senators yesterday claimed that race-hate speech laws are protecting Muslim criminals, because everyday citizens are unable to abuse every Muslim come across.

Following on from this, party leader Pauline Hanson called out “lefty” thought police, while also denying she had ever been a racist.

While delivering a statement to Parliament today condemning political correctness in the debate over freedom of speech, Hanson took it upon herself to define what racism actually was.

According to the Senator, a ‘racist’ was someone who believed their race was superior to others, which Hanson said she had never done – apart from the time she published a book that suggested Australia will be run by an Asian lesbian cyborg by 2050 and that Aborigines were cannibals who ate thier own kids.

“Apart from a few slips ups here and there, when have I ever been racist?”

“Apart from me saying that 1.3 billion are a disease and we need to vaccinate against them”

“And all that stuff isn’t even THAT racist anyway”

Hanson then went on to claim that she had, in fact, never said anything that could be considered discriminatory to anyone, except for the time she said anyone with a fear of guns was ‘sexually retarded’.

But the Senator said she had been the target of reverse racism.

“I’ve never had it easy” she said.

Dastyari Gives His Cousin A Spray For Picking Him Up From Parliament In The WRX

Ahead of dinner with their Maamaan (grandmother), Senator Sam Dastyari has berated his younger cousin, Ashkan for doing exactly what he told him not to do.

Ashkan, under strict instructions from his federal politician cousin, was told to either bring his mum’s Holden Astra or park down the street a bit, where other people from work won’t be able to see the Rex.

Standing out front of Parliament House today, Sam was horrified to see his cousin’s no fuss 540whp WRX STI purring on the rubber wetpour, in plain sight of all his federal colleagues leaving work for the day.

“Are you fucking kidding, mate?” Sam spits at the 22-year-old brickies labourer.

“Way to go full wog on Parliament House! Imagine if Bill saw me getting into this piece of fucking copbait!”

Ashkan, a former u20s rugby league prodigy for the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs, appeared to take offence at his cousin Sam’s ungratefulness.

“Yeah alright fuckhead! I just drove two fucking hours to get here. You’re off ya fucking head”

“Get in the car”

Senator Dastyari, still fuming with the embarrassment that a political rival might have seen his cousin’s lowered show car, refused to give up.

“Pull ya fucking head in! I gave you strict instructions to park the cunt down the street. That’s if you had to bring this goey sled to the capital”

Ashkan, now standing outside of the car, tells his older cousin to either get the fuck in, or miss dinner at their grandmother’s for the second time this month.

“Maybe next time you can get the fucking Chinese to pay for your flights to Ashfield!”

“I’ve been waiting here for half an hour. I oughta fucking leave you here”

Hanson: “The Major Parties Aren’t Listening, Everyday Australians Are Sick Of Cyclones”

TEXT:

In a stark contrast to fellow One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts’ comments that suggest the soon-to-be natural disaster of Cyclone Debbie doesn’t actually exist, party leader Pauline Hanson has today blamed the major parties for not preventing this national emergency, like she would have.

Speaking to the media from the safety of Parliament house in Canberra today, the red-headed senator Pauline Hanson told North Queenslanders to make sure they were ready for the imminent Cyclone Debbie.

“Make sure you have enough Weetbix and milk and DVDs” she said.

“but leave Vegemite out of it. Because they are halal certified. Even in emergencies, we should be avoiding halal certification”

Hanson, who has already booked her flights to walk through the ravaged Capricornian towns later this week and take advantage of the suffering with hollow political promises, has also made it clear that this cyclone would have never happened under her watch.

“The major parties just aren’t listening” she said.

“Everyday Australians have made it clear. No more halal, no more refugees and no more cyclones”

“If I was in charge of Queensland, this would have never happened”

When asked how she could possibly be ‘in charge of Queensland’ – Pauline Hanson reiterated that they’ll know what she means soon enough, as her party hopes to win upward of 15 seats in the upcoming QLD state election.

“Of course, I’ll still be in Canberra. But I’ll have someone to run Queensland for me. Someone with common sense – someone like Malcolm Roberts”

“… Except he’ll be in Canberra too… So it’ll be someone I pick in a rush in the weeks leading to the election”

When asked how Cyclone Debbie could have possibly been avoided, Hanson said it could have been easily avoided if the major parties had just listened to everyday Australians, like the ones who just had their penalty rates slashed by One Nation and now have their childcare subsidies halved.

One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts has stood by his comments that some “girls” enjoy being cat-called, and has demanded that these ‘so-called experts’ show him empirical evidence that says otherwise.

Roberts is yet to be convinced that women don’t like being wolf-whistled at by tradesmen or hungover blokes in commodores, further more he says some even enjoy being told to show their tits.

The 61-year-old, who received 77 votes in the last Federal election, has asked chief scientist Dr Alan Finkel to spell out his logic in asserting that human-induced catcalls are offensive to women.

The Queensland MP made the unfounded statement while speaking to ABC’s Radio National Drive host Patricia Karvelas about possible changes to the Racial Discrimination Act.

When Karvelas asked Roberts whether he thought verbal sexual harassment should be legal, the 61-year-old queried whether wolf-whistling was universally offensive.

“Is a wolf-whistle harassment? It depends upon the person. Some girls think that that is wonderful, they, you know, they smile,” he said.

“Some women even show their tits to blokes who yell ‘shuzya tits’ – at events like the Gold Coast Indy or Supernats”

“Some even enjoy being told to show their snatch”

White House assures voters angry-face-emojis on Facebook live feed are fake

TEXT:

White House press secretary Sean Spicer addressed the media a short time ago regarding the ongoing FBI investigation into potential Trump team links to Russia and claims of a wiretap on his administration orchestrated by Barack Obama.

During his statement to the press, Spicer was asked about both the record-low approval ratings and the record-high amount of angry faces plastered across the Facebook live feed of the media conference.

“The media has been caught out favouring the left in the past, this is just another example of their shocking and disgusting bias,” he said.

“Come on Facebook, I thought you were an American company.”

Spicer revealed that he saw the sea of angry faces stream across the feed in real-time, allowing him the privilege to call them out while still on the air.

“What you’re seeing here is face. Facebook is changing all the likes and love hearts to angry faces to feed their own agenda.”

FBI director James Comey hit back, saying that when they’re done investigating these allegations, they’ll begin investigating those just made by Spicer.

Abbott: 18C Is An Attack On Our Freedom To Tell Racist Jokes Without Scanning The Room

TEXT:

Tony Abbott has today praised Malcolm Turnbull for crumbling to the right-wing factions within the coalition, and readdressing the liberal party echo chamber issue of amending the racial hatred language section of the Racial Discrimination Act.

The former Prime Minister, who attempted to change 18C and remove the limits on freedom of speech when talking about black and brown people, told the Liberal Party Room the Prime Minister and the Government were doing the right thing.

“Congratulations to the Prime Minister and the Government of having another go on this,” Mr Abbott said. “Free speech is fundamental to our civilisation and is clearly imperilled by 18C as it stands.”

“Australians are sick of having to scan their immediate surroundings before saying something dicey at a social event or in the workplace”

“As it stands, 18C is an attack on our freedom to drop racist jokes without having to scan the room”

Despite the fact that the current variation of the Racial Discrimination Act has been quite inneffective at stemming rampant casual racism in Australian society, Malcolm Turnbull took to his party room this morning to reform the Racial Discrimination Act by removing the words of “offend, insult and humiliate” in favour of an offence of harass or intimidate.

The bill was endorsed by older-religious people in the Liberal Party room despite reservations among some moderate MPs.

“Everyday Australians, like Andrew Bolt, are sick of being taken to court for saying things like the Stolen Generation never happened or that black people aren’t capable of raising children”

“To force people like Andrew and myself to have to pander to the oppressed and consider their feeling or cultural sensitivities… It’s an affront to democracy”

Clive Palmer and Campbell Newman to settle long-running feud the octagon

TEXT:

A senior and respected Queensland politician is set to die later this year as both Clive Palmer and former Queensland premier Campbell Newman look to settle their differences in the MMA octagon.

The Ville Resort-Casino has agreed to host the June 12 fight between the two stalwarts of state and federal politics, with both camps agreeing that somebody is going to get seriously hurt come wintertime.

“I’ve been training for this fight for over a year,” says Palmer.

“This is the fittest I’ve ever been in my life. It’s going to be like the end of Gladiator. Newman will be on his knees and I will deliver a final swift judo kick across the jaw – delivering his soul to the afterlife,”

“Baku is the capital of Azerbaijan. Milk comes from a Friesian. I’m going to bring Campbell’s life to completion.” he said.

That’s not going to happen, according to the man who saved Brisbane from utter destruction during the 10-11 flood. Campbell Newman agrees with the statement that he, not a judge’s gavel will be the force of justice Palmer has seemingly avoided time and time again.

Training out of Woodridge carport, the now 53-year-old said Clive is going to get kicked and punched more times than a handsy Irishman at the Straddie pub.

“I’ve heard on good authority that Clive plans to smother me if he can get me on the ground,” said Newman.

“Like just lie down on top of my head and not move until my brain starts falling to bits from the lack of oxygen. But I won’t let that happen. When he comes into tackle me I’ll punt the cunt, I’ll fucking Akermanis his head clean over the reef. Then probably hammer fist him on top of his dome on the way down. Shit will be cash.”

The fight is to be umpired by The Hon. Bob Katter and the judges will be selected from a panel of Queensland sporting greats.

Liberal MP Whose Only Other Job Was In The Police Force Surprisingly Not A Great Bloke

TEXT:

A man who spent his young adulthood handing out speeding fines and telling people to not swear around him – has not made a smooth transition into being a likeable Liberal Party politician, it has been confirmed.

It has been revealed today that the Federal Minister for Immigration and Member for Dickson in North Brisbane, Peter Dutton MP, who barely managed to secure his seat last election, is as unlikable as ever, following a catastrophic 18 months in the Turnbull cabinet.

Raised in Brisbane, Queensland, Dutton was educated at the Queensland Police Academy before becoming a Queensland Police officer for nine years, eventually working in the Drug Squad in suburbs such as Red Hill in the early 1990s.

With only one job to draw experiences from before entering politics, It is believed that Liberal party drifter pounced on the role of Immigration Minister, after boasting years of experience in locking up people of colour in the streets of Brisbane.

Recent numbers from Newspoll find that Peter Dutton would be even more likeable as a bloke if he was still a policeman.

“What we have found is that, after the incidents involving self-immolation in Dutton’s offshore detention centres last year, Peter Dutton would probably be more popular in his immediate community if he was still handing out speeding fines” said one statistician.

Labor Staffer Who Says ‘Comrade’ 6 Times A Day Disgusted At Pauline For Praising Putin

TEXT:

At 27-years-old, Liam Softchunt has been an employee of the Labor Party for just over ten years.

Despite only ever wearing high-vis a few times while visiting construction sites with his former employer, now-Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews, Liam is a staunch advocate for industrial solidarity.

His affinity with the plight of the worker is epitomised by the Eureka stockade t-shirt he often wears to the gym, and the fact that he starts every email with the word ‘Comrade’.

In Australian politics, the term comrade is strongly associated with Communism and the Soviet Union, unless it is used in relation to the military. However it is still used as an informal form of address among some Labur Party members, and in a more serious manner by many smaller parties of the left.

While acknowledging that paying homage to the USSR over six times a day might be a bad look for his political party, Liam says it’s mainly a result of him not being working class enough to use the terms ‘bro’ or ‘brother’.

However, despite his watered down homage toward the Soviet Empire, Liam says claiming Russian President Vladimir Putin as an ally or even someone to look up to as a world leader is flat out disgusting.

Last week, the rapidly growing membership of Pauline Hanson’s One Nation party stalled over the weekend, as distressed voters found themselves confused and angry by the federal senators recent ABC interview where she praised Russian President Vladimir Putin.

In an attempt to emulate President Trump’s brand of political shock, Ms Hanson said President Putin was ‘very patriotic towards his country’.

Liam says these comments are flat out disgraceful, even psychopathic.

“I was very glad to see my Comrade Bill Shorten get the drop on condenming these comments”

“It took Turnbull over twenty minutes to find a media scrum and condemn Pauline. Just disgusting”

“As for Pauline. It’s definitely the reason she lost the WA election to my Comrade Mark McGowan”

“Good to see common sense has provailed and the mighty workers will once again unite above the bogan bourgeoisie”

“It’s absolutely shameful”

Failed WA One Nation candidate back at old job shooting pigeons at the airport

TEXT:

While conservative West Australian political leaders begin squabbling and arguing over what went wrong during the weekend election, a One Nation candidate has quietly returned to his old life shooting pigeons at Perth’s Jandakot Airport.

Deverill Slacks, a 47-year-old avian pest control specialist from Armadale, spoke to The Advocate about his ‘devastating’ election loss and how he’s been left picking up the pieces after being promised to much.

“Pauline said I was going to be the next Troy Buswell,” said the crestfallen Cancer.

“But on election night, I barely got one percent of the vote. I’ve embarrassed myself and my family, I even got a function room to watch the count. My wife was so upset, she worked her way through a whole platter of oriental-themed finger foods before she could even look at me.”

Throwing his hat in the ring for a spot in the West Australian Upper House, Slacks was ‘all but guaranteed’ a place in the new parliament by the surging popularity of One Nation in the state.

However, things failed to go to plan for the unabridged xenophobes with spiritual leader Pauline Hanson blaming everything from the preference deal with the Liberals, to the unsuitability of candidates such as Mr Slacks.

“It was a real big pill to swallow,” said Slacks.

“I mean, ten years ago there were the same amount of birds at the airport and they’re expecting us to believe that the climate is changing? The birds are the climate. And the whole crew here used to be whitefellas, now the ground crew here are all Muslims from Christ knows where. Do you need reminding of what happens when you mix Islam with aviation?”

WA Election: Pauline Vows To Come Down Hard On Banks Trying To Repossess Jet Skis

TEXT:

One Nation party leader Pauline Hanson has been touring the state of Western Australia this week promising voters that her party is the only one that will be able make life as spectacular as it was during the WA mining boom.

She has repeatedly stressed that voters themselves should take control of their preferences, and to remember that One Nation is the only party that represents the disgruntled middle class who didn’t make very good decisions about how to spend their influx of household income during the mining boom.

It appears that with over fifty candidates, that she has only really spoken to over the phone, the federal senator – who will have nothing to do with the day-to-day operations in Western Australia – is under siege with threats of legal action and abandonment from within her ranks.

This last-minute mutiny comes after her candidates realise that she isn’t that nice and caring in real life, and is what some of them describe as a ‘puppet’ for big business and the Liberal party.

In a last minute dash to secure votes from the jaded working class, Pauline Hanson has promised that she will come down hard on any of the major banks that attempt to repossess jet skis, dirt bikes, 4x4s, or plasma screens that were impulsively purchased during the Western Australian mining boom.

“You are Australians. You deserve better than to be told no” she said.

“Just remember, One Nation is the only party who represents those of you who made astronomical amounts of money during the mining boom and can’t understand why you’ll never find a salary that good again”

With just two more sleeps until Saturday’s election, there is no shortage of controversy and drama on the WA campaign trail as tensions have erupted between the Nationals and Liberals, and some Liberal MPs received death threats. Pauline Hanson says both the major parties are forgetting the needs of the everyday Western Australians.

“We understand your worries and concerns. We understand what you’ve lost”

“Which is why One Nation is promising cheaper flights to Bali”

Malcolm Roberts demands to see the science behind ‘magic oven’ in staffroom

TEXT:

One Nation Senator Malcolm Roberts has asked the Upper House this morning about the microwave oven in his staffroom, asking for the science behind the ‘magic oven’ that warms his lunch each day.

Rejecting the commonly accepted theory behind how microwave ovens work, the Senator explained that he didn’t believe radiowaves could defrost a meat pie in three minutes.

“I mean, seriously,” he said.

“There’s something more going on. Something we’re not being told about. You know that these science ovens are banned in Russia? Doesn’t that tell you something? It’s impossible to defrost a meat pie that quickly with radiowaves – the same waves they reckon you hear on the radio.”

After speaking to the Senate about the microwave oven in the One Nation staffroom, a number of his colleagues looked blankly at the ceiling and wondered how things got this bad – including freshman Senator Derryn Hinch from the Hinch Batman Justice Party.

Though he felt sad that former Liberal Senator Bill Heffernan wasn’t there to put an end to it before Roberts even got to the end of his question.

“I reckon Bill would’ve just leant forward and said, ‘Shut up, Roberts you fucking idiot,’ then maybe thrown a pipebomb at him. Most of us just sat there like stunned mullets while he questioned the science behind the microwave oven in his staffroom,” said Hinch.

“This will be an interesting term.”

Joyce Propositions Albanese To ‘Run It Straight’ During Parliament Question Time

TEXT:

Parliament question time has made way for a lighthearted threat of physical confrontation in Canberra today, as Deputy Prime Minister offered Grayndler MP Anthony Albanese to ‘run it straight’.

Joyce, a former rugby union clubman from the New England, lost his temper during a penalty-rates shouting match between the two parties.

Albanese, a former junior rugby league product of the South Sydney comp, appeared to have ‘gone too far’ in his accusations that the Coalition MPs had ‘never spent any time around real punters’.

“What was that?!” barked a passive aggressive Joyce.

“I bet you won’t run it straight?’

“Come on, let’s go outside. Run it straight Albo”

The entire Australian parliament then broke out in ‘oooooh’ sounds before Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull turned to Joyce to ask what ‘Run it straight’ means?

“It means I stand on the lawn and Albo runs as hard at me as he can” Joyce informed the PM.

“Well, what do you say, Albo?” Turnbull asked Albanese.

Albanese responded by saying that the proposition was ‘typical of the loony libs’ and that he doesn’t need to dignify himself by physically overpowering Barnaby Joyce.

“Now you just sound scared” said Turnbull.

The entire Liberal party then broke out in chicken clucking sounds.

“I’m not scared!” barked a defensive Albanese.

“cluck cluck cluck” shouted backbencher George Christensen.

“Shut up you Christensen, I’d punch holes through you! You walking Lowes ad!” shouted Albanese.

Peter Dutton Divides His Soul Into 7 Horcruxes As He Makes Move On Liberal Leadership

TEXT:

With conservative commentators backing Peter Dutton as the next Prime Minister, it has been revealed today the Minister of Immigration has divided what remains of his soul into seven fragmented policies to be spread across seven factions within the Australian Liberal Party.

The fragments, known as ‘horcruxes’, will be hidden in the disguise of policies aimed at not allowing brown people to live in Australia – a constant, but less talked about, sentiment that remains hidden within both sides of federal politics – and one that Dutton has been familiar with for many years.

As outlined in popular anglo-celtic folklore, a Horcrux is an object in which a Dark wizard or witch has hidden a fragment of his or her soul for the purpose of attaining political immortality. Horcruxes can only be created after committing murder, the supreme act of evil, or allowing people to self-immolate.

With polls sliding, and political commentators gearing for yet another leadership spill, it is believed that the former Brisbane cop, and man who boycotted the national apology to the Stolen Generations, is backing himself as the champion of Australian purity, to possibly take over from Malcolm Turnbull in a desperate bid to remain on $200k a year.

When asked if he was worried about being taken out by younger political rivals, Dutton is quoted as saying “There are alleged facts that are being put forward by some of the advocates which are patently incorrect, if not fabricated.”

He then went on to point out that innumerate and illiterate refugees could take Australian jobs that Australians don’t want to have, before making a cheap shot at the Australian public broadcaster.

Pauline Supporters Feeling Confused And Distressed By Her New Love Of Snow Wogs

TEXT:

The rapidly growing membership of Pauline Hanson’s One Nation party has stalled over the weekend, as distressed voters find themselves confused and even angry by her recent ABC interview where she praised Russian President Vladimir Putin.

In an attempt to emulate President Trump’s brand of political shock, Ms Hanson said President Putin was ‘very patriotic towards his country’

“The people love him, he is doing so well for the country,” he said.

“So many Australians here want that leadership here in Australia. They want a leader here to stand up for the people and fight for this nation.

When asked if she thought these comments might offend the family members of the 38 Australians killed after the shooting down of the Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 over Ukraine, Pauline Hanson said that she hadn’t thought of that, and proceeded to question his involvement in the disaster to save face.

“Did he push the button?” she asked.

Local storeman and, until Saturday, devout One Nation supporter, Tony Oakey (55) says he doesn’t feel comfortable with Pauline Hanson’s newfound love of ‘snow wogs’.

“She’s jumped the shark. I didn’t vote for her into the senate for her to turn around and make me embrace a culture I don’t know anything about”

“That’s not why we voted for you Pauline. Aussies don’t like Russians, stop saying shit like that”

Tony told our supporters the fears he inherited from his father surrounding communism were almost as prevalent as his fears he inherited from the Daily Telegraph surrounding Islam.

“She can’t pick and choose. It’s either hate everyone or love everyone. And I’m sick of being told to love people”

Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull responded to Ms Hanson’s comments during a press conference in Queensland on Sunday.

“What the fuck” he said to reporters from the Dalby Herald.

“That’s a bit full on”

“I would say, shut the hell up Pauline and focus on trying to bring polio back into Aussie households. That seems to be your thing nowadays”

Ms Hanson has indeed actually focused her attention to bringing polio and other extinct illnesses back, after spruiked a lack of trust in government-supported immunisation, using the anti-vaccination line that no one cared about her children more than their parents, and urged people to “do their own research”.

Inner-City Law Student Dreams To One Day Lead ALP And Fight For Fellow Workers

Newtown-based frisbee enthusiast, Julian Shawke (26) says that Australian politicians seem to be forgetting how real people live.

“That’s why I joined Young Labor. So that I could bridge this cultural gap that seems to have opened between the party and the workers. They are out of touch, and I think we need to work on this” he says.

A vocal critic of both the Liberals and increasingly popular minor parties, Julian also acknowledges that certain factions of his beloved Labor party are starting to lose their way – he says his harsh upbringing in suburban North-Western Sydney keeps him in check.

As the son of two heavily politicised public servants who both work in outdated but secure roles within wildly bureaucratic state government departments, Julian understands what life is like for the common worker.

“I’ve lived it. I know” he says.

“I never went to a private school. I was forced to go to a selective school in the inner city”

Having briefly worked as a cash-in-hand labourer during the second year of his arts degree at Sydney Uni, Julian says he is 100% confident that he can walk in both worlds as he strives to climb the ranks of the Australian Labor Party.

“Do You Want Me To Get Her Arrested Again?” Howard Offers Turnbull Help With Pauline

TEXT:

Former Prime Minister John Howard has today advised the current leader, Malcolm Turnbull on how to deal with the renaissance of Pauline Hanson’s One Nation Party.

Howard, who was leader of the Liberal Party during Pauline Hanson’s first dabble with federal politics, is well remembered for his ability to continue running the country without dedicating too much energy to her xenophobic brand of populism.

“It’s just unproductive for Governments to waste any time on her” Howard told Turnbull

“You can’t laugh at her… If you do that you’ll have every jet-ski owner and his dog calling you smug and out of touch”

“If you make friends with her, you’ll end up with another sixteen George Christensens in your camp”

“What’s going to happen is that everyone’s gonna get bored of her and she’ll get desperate. That’s when she’ll end up doing herself in”

“Or I could see if I can get her arrested again”

Many political strategists today believe that the likelihood of Pauline Hanson’s second fall from grace is growing by the day, as Australia’s working class begin realise she isn’t really capable of anything other than offending Muslims during press conferences.

“First it was the Asians… and then people realised they enjoyed beef noodle soup” said Howard.

“Now its the Muslims and Africans. Just wait a couple years, our Olympic Basketball team will give everyone reason to love these new blackfellas”

Pauline Hanson’s first demise was so spectacular that in August 2003, Hanson was jailed after she and her adviser at the time, David Ettridge, were found guilty of fraudulently registering One Nation, in a desperate bid to get back into the spotlight that shone so brightly on her in 2007.

The former fish and chip shop owner was also convicted of fraudulently obtaining electoral funding to the tune of about half-a-million.

“But what about Western Australia” a panicked Turnbull asked Howard.

“The libs over there have already allied with her”

Howard assured to Turnbull that Western Australian liberals have “always pretty much been the same as One Nation anyway”

“Don’t worry about WA, mate. They are nearly out of coal…”

“They’re opinion isn’t going to matter in a few months”

New ‘Bad Boy’ Bill Shorten Fronts Media With Sunnies On The Back Of His Neck

It appears that Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten MP, has now taken to wearing his sunglasses on the back of his neck, in an attempt to boost his bad boy image and appeal to younger voters.

Earlier last month it was revealed that former Union heavy had attempted to cultivate new ‘bad boy’ image by growing out a Shannon Noll-style soul patch and whitening his teeth.

But it seems that sunglasses indoors isn’t enough to appeal to the Australian youth, who have come out in droves in the obscure by-elections over the weekend.

Shorten has had to up the ante by chewing gum and wearing his sunnies on the back of his neck.

It’s understood by The Advocate that the 51-year-old took a leaf out of Mr Turnbull’s book and made a visit to The Canberra Centre that night where he picked up two pairs of cool new sunglasses upon recommendation by his press secretary.

Malcolm Turnbull reveals ‘all this business’ with Tony Abbott prevented him from enjoying The Oscars

Each year, the prime minister takes the time to properly unwind and destress by watching The Oscars – something he’d enjoyed doing for most of his adult life.

A known movie buff and Oscars devotee, Malcolm Turnbull explained to Marie Claire magazine in 2008 that he loves kicking off his shoes after a long hard day of working for the Australian people by pouring himself a glass of some good stuff, curling up on the couch in his home theatre and trying to guess who’s going to take home the gong.

However, this year was different.

The political turmoil surrounding the former merchant banker has reached fever-pitch, with a number of conservative members and senators coming out of the woodwork with an axe to grind.

“It just wasn’t the same,” said Mr Turnbull.

“No matter what I did, I couldn’t enjoy myself. There’s just too much on my mind at the moment. You know, with that Bible-thumping Koran-burning lunatic splintering off in the senate. Then you’ve got Tony taking pot shots at me like we’re Jude Law and Ed Harris in Enemy At The Gates.”

Even the biggest gaffe in Oscars history could lighten the mood inside that Point Piper home theatre, with barely a smile coming across the PM’s face as he watched a hundred hearts break at the same time

Local Lefty Feeling Conflicted After Siding With Andrew Bolt Over Prominent Muslim

A St Kilda non-government agency worker has found himself feeling conflicted today after siding with the ubiquitous conservative commentator Andrew Bolt over prominent Muslim spokesman Keysar Trad.

Brent Kruger took some time this afternoon to speak with The Advocate about the internal struggle he’s facing after he’d taken a long walk up and down the beach.

“I mean, I usually side against [Andrew] Bolt without even thing. He always tries to take the conservative high road, but this time, he actually looks like the good guy,” he said.

“God damn it! For fuck’s sake, I only just turned 38. Why am I suddenly starting to feel more conservative? Is this what happens? Is it because I started my own business? I need to know before I turn into my Dad.”

The reason why, it seems, is because no self-respecting lefty can side against Andrew Bolt when he’s trying to explain that violence against women is never acceptable.

“Maybe that’s it?” said the 38-year-old.

“The look on Andrew’s face when Keysar said that hitting a woman was a last resort said it all. It was all like, ‘oi but nah, do you have fucking rocks in your head Keysar? You are on national television saying that beating woman is kind of OK? Are you fucking serious, mate?’ and that was it. I agreed with Andrew Bolt, starting this whole existential crisis.”

Malcolm Turnbull tells those relying on penalty rates that “they should’ve listened in school”

TEXT:

Just hours after slashing weekend penalty rates, the Prime Minister has explained to those affected by the business-stimulating measures that they wouldn’t be in this position had they listen better in school.

“It’s a policy change that will only cause significant hardship to our nation’s simplest people,” said Malcolm Turnbull. “If you listened in school and worked hard, instead of smoking pot and getting tasteless tattoos, then you’ll be fine.”

Turnbull has come under significant criticism for cutting Sunday penalty rates, with one affected punter challenging the PM to live off $600 a week – a figure set to fall by up to $80 a week thanks to to cuts.

“I don’t have to live off $600 a week because I’m not a dumb cunt,” said Turnbull.

“This person, in particular, wouldn’t have to live off $600 a week either, but the thing is that she seems like a pretty simple person, so she has to. Not everybody can be happy in this world. Some need to eat shit and die for the rest of us to get ahead.”

Quick to hit back at the PM, Opposition leader Bill Shorten said that while most of what Turnbull has said rings true, he could’ve worded it a bit differently.

“These cuts are bad for workers, but good for business,” revealed Shorten.

“But as you all know, we support the workers and business if it’s in our best interest. So we don’t know what to do here, so we’ll just say it’s bad then move on.”

Malcolm Turnbull Appoints Xavier Rudd As Chief Advisor In Roll Out Of Medical Marijuana

TEXT:

Byron Bay-based independent-folk-didge recording artist, Xavier Rudd, is the newest addition to the Federal Government’s advisory team, it was announced earlier today.

The 38-year-old multi-instrumentalist/singer-songwriter was today appointed as the chief advisor on the new roll-out medical marijuana in Australia.

As was confirmed by Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt this morning, medical marijuana will soon be easier to access amid moves by the Federal Government to boost local supply and loosen importation laws.

Speaking to The Betoota Advocate today, Rudd says he’s ‘absolutely stoked to get the gig’

“I’ve been a long time supporter of freein’ the ‘erb” he said

“[laughter] anyone who’s visited my Californian Bungalow in Lennox Heads would probably tell you that I’ve done my research”

The drug, which is pitched to treat patients with chronic or painful illnesses including cancer, severe epilepsy and motor neurone disease looks to be available under the Government’s new scheme in eight weeks.

The medication is currently sourced from overseas on a case-by-case basis, but the new scheme would see local cultivation and supply with an interim fast track on importation while crops are grown.

Xavier Rudd says he’s “really keen to work with Barnaby” on the Agricultural side of cannabis as well.

“I’ve got a few secrets I’d love to share” he said, while fidgeting with a pair of clapsticks.

“For example, if you fertilise the crops with bong residue and only water it with bong water, you get a really potent skunk-hybrid”

“No need for hydro”

Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt said it was the “first time in history” the Government would facilitate an import process for the interim supply.

Albo Spotted Boxing Cow Carcasses In Marrickville Cool Room With Bob Hawke

TEXT:

The remaining Australians who consider themselves loyal to the slightly left of the two Australian major parties are rejoicing today, after reports that Anthony Albanese MP was spotted in a refrigerated Marrickville warehouse with former Prime Minister Bob Hawke.

This follows speculation that the leader of the opposition, Bill Shorten may be unfit to lead the ALP into the uncharted waters of populist politics currently taking over all rational debate a post-Trump world.

That, as well as Sunday night’s newspoll results that reveal the Prime Minister now leads Labor’s Bill Shorten as preferred leader 45 to 31.

With Pauline Hanson’s One Nation still hoping to sweep in on the disillusioned regional seats as the citizenship saga continues, the ALP are reportedly looking for someone new.

The answer: Anthony Albanese MP – the Italian stallion, born and raised in the Camperdown housos. It seems his aggressive style of politics has invoked a nostalgic sense of Labor glory in the former Labor Prime Minister Bob Hawke.

With both men spotted wearing tracksuits and murmuring to each other in working class accents inside a low key butcher’s cool room yesterday, it seems Hawke may have taken the woes of his dear Labor Party into his own hands.

“Hawkey wasn’t giving him an inch” says one witness.

“I heard him yell ‘if this is what you want, then we have to do it my way’ and kept barking in his ear”

Lambie Vows To Protect Tasmania’s Struggling Timber Industry From Shakira Law

TEXT:

Jacqui Lambie says she heard somewhere, but can’t remember when, that the vague concept of religious law within Islamic communities is the reason why Tasmania doesn’t have any jobs and not much is going on there.

“We are fed up with Shakira law” she roared into a Facebook live video out the front of Burnie Kmart.

A nearby punter responded to these comments.

“Oh baby when she talks like that” said No-Teeth Keith, from the Burnie Royal Hotel, who was approached by our reporters.

“I love Jacqui. She’s going to bring jobs back here. She’s carrying this state on her hip like a busy footy mum. Her hips don’t lie”

The Australian Bureau of Statistics has revealed that 1.5 percent of the nation’s population is Muslim, and 0.2 of Tasmania’s population.

It’s for this reason, the Tasmanian senator claims, that once bustling industries in the apple island are no longer doing too well.

Lambie says everything was going well until she started noticing people wearing head-covering religious garments.

“We’ve got no jobs! We aren’t allowed to cut down trees anymore. I bet you I know why”

“It’s the varying religious practices of 1.6 billion people. We are sick of it.”

“Remember Beaconsfield? Remember the Tarkine! The 1030 Muslims aren’t helping us bring back jobs!”

Country MP considers resigning after learning these inner-city lefties hate his guts

TEXT:

Flicking through a stack of emails his media girl printed out for him this morning, a Western Australian federal country member sighed and wondered why he gets so many mean-spirited emails – prompting him to ask himself whether now is the time to throw in the towel.

Speaking to The Advocate earlier today, Michael Kruger, the Member for Donerack in WA’s Kimberley regional, explained that there’s rarely a day do by where he doesn’t receive some sort of hate mail sent from the socialist bowels of each capital city.

“Sydney is the worst,” said Kruger from his Fitzroy Crossing electoral office.

“Sometimes they even ring me up to tell me what a disgusting and corrupt dog I am and all that jazz. I mean, can they not? It’s hard to please everybody without these facially-pierced sexual deviants calling me names.”

In 2011, Kruger was placed between the leftie crosshairs after he responded to the suspension of live exports by saying that perhaps they were ill-informed before they made that decision.

Delivering a personal attack on then-Prime Minister Julia Gillard, suggesting that her Labor government was ill-equipped to make a call on an industry that she and her party didn’t quite understand, Kruger received a number of threats to both him and his family over the remarks.

“Sometimes it just isn’t worth it,” he said.

“You try to keep everybody happy, I try to do the best for the people of The Kimberly, but these personal and hate-fuelled attacks on my family and I are making me want to resign.”

“I can only imagine how the Deputy PM feels. God those inner-city gender benders hate him, but it looks like Barnaby doesn’t care. Don’t know how he does it.”

Turnbull gets some pointers on how to deal with Trump from polite Canadian

TEXT:

The prime minister has received advice on how to deal with the President of the United States from a polite Canadian man who’s just spent the weekend in Washington with him.

Speaking via telephone this morning to Malcolm Turnbull, Canadian PM Justin Trudeau explained how he was able to interact with President Donald Trump without being made to look like a little bitch.

“Basically, Justin gave him the run-down on Trump and how to deal with his mickey mouse horseshit should the pair actually meet face-to-face one day,” said one aide.

“Malcolm was concerned about the handshake, which is odd because he did work at Goldman Sachs. If you’ve ever shaken a bloke’s hand who works for Goldman, you bloody know about it. They’re more solid than an AU Falcon.”

The Canadian Capricorn then went on to illustrate that it’s OK to feel nervous when meeting a powerful man like Trump, but it’s not OK for him to put it over you.

Using the examples from earlier this month, Trudeau spelt out to Malcolm that letting ‘you-know-who’ repeatedly get his name wrong on purpose and telling the world that he’s going to ‘neg on a deal’ he made with Obama is some serious bitch behaviour that needs to be rectified.

“Don’t let him push you around like that, that’s what he wants, bro,” said Trudeau.

“Next time you talk to him, don’t take any gruff. You tell him that he’s going to take those asylum seekers and he’s going to thank you for them. Tell him to stop bullying you  – and if he doesn’t stop, you’ll tell the UN on him.”

Daily Telegraph reporters reminded that ‘fact-checking’ is also part of job role

TEXT:

Coming just days after Wikipedia outlawed the use of Daily Mail articles on their website, the editor of The Daily Telegraph has taken the time to remind his reporters that fact-checking is also a part of being a journalist.

Concerned that his newspaper may face a similar fate to that of the Daily Mail, editor Chris Dore called a meeting with journalists this afternoon to instruct them that their articles must contain some element of truth.

“We’re in the business of news and unfortunately, that means there’s an onus on us to be factual and unbiased – no matter how loony the left is,” said Dore.

“That means, ladies and gentleman, we must change our ways if we are to survive. I don’t want to see us held in a similar vein to the Daily Mail. [Rupert] Murdoch has also made it clear that he doesn’t want to see us head down the same road as Fairfax, either – constantly being six months away from going cunt up is not good for the shareholders.”

One of those senior reporters present in that meeting took the time to explain to The Advocate this afternoon just what the ramifications are for him and his colleagues, now they’ve been instructed to be more honest.

Stating categorically for the record that things are already quite grim at the paper, things are only set to get worse.

“There’s a reason why every reporter in the building calls a story a ‘yarn’ – because that’s what they are. Yarns. You never let a bit of lefty PC truth get in the way of a good yarn,” he said.

“If you want to feel good about yourself, go read something by that stickybeak fun-sucker Kate McClymont. If you want to be entertained, engaged and a little bit ticked off, pick up a Tele.”

“We shouldn’t be treated like criminals, we’re writers.”

Chloe Shorten moves aloe vera burn gel to the fridge for when Bill gets home

After learning that husband Bill had a bad day, politically, Chloe Shorten moved a tube of aloe vera burn gel from the bottom draw of their Canberra holiday home – to the fridge.

“Chilling it makes it more effective and soothing,” explained Chloe. “Apparently Malcolm seriously rekt him today in parliament and he got burned real bad.”

“Poor Bill. Things were going so well recently. Cory Bernardi shitting the bed, Tony Abbott stepping on every egg shell he can find and Trump hanging up on Malcolm. You can’t win every day, I suppose.”

Late this afternoon, the prime minister unleashed an unprecedented attack on the leader of the opposition, labelling him a ‘parasite’ and a ‘sycophant to billionaires’ – to which Bill had no reply.

Video of the tongue lashing has since gone viral, with everybody from DPM Barnaby Joyce to Tanya Plibersek struggling to contain their laughter as Malcolm Turnbull tore Bill Shorten’s life to pieces.

“Yeah mate, he’s got his fucking mojo back, that’s for sure,” said Joyce. “Folk were off him for cutting our Gold Passes and all, but at this rate, he’ll let us smoke inside again during winter. He’s on fire!”

Equally full of praise was fellow frontbencher Christopher Pyne, who was seen licking his lips and writhing around in his seat with sheer ecstasy during the exchange.

Leila McKinnon Tells Cory Bernardi To Take Off Sunglasses And Apologise For His Party

TEXT:

An out-of-control party being hosted by a 47-year-old South Australian by the name of Cory Bernardi, has drawn at least 500 wild members while his Liberal party leaders holidayed on the Gold Coast.

The story was among the most-read on the BBC’s news website last night.

Cory’s interview with Channel Nine’s A Current Affair, during which he comprehensively steam-rolled host Leila McKinnon (wife of Channel Nine chief David Gyngell), was uploaded to the YouTube website yesterday afternoon, further expanding his notoriety.

Within minutes of going online, McKinnon’s stern interviewing method had backfired, transforming Cory, who was interviewed shirtless with his pierced nipple on show, from naughty conservative to international anti-gay rights hero.

Cory’s neighbours and local Police would not have been amused, and nor would his mother and stepfather, who were on the Channel Seven show Today Tonight expressing their shame over his antics and their concern over a potential repercussions.

Pursed-lipped McKinnon, clearly frustrated when Cory refused her repeated requests to remove his huge sunglasses and offer an apology for his party, lost her temper, adopting a school principal tone to suggest the boy: “Go away and take a good long hard look at yourself.”

But before she could cut the link, the boy shot back: “I have, everyone has and they love it.”

Di Natale Consults Haitian Witch Doctor In Collingwood About Placing A Curse On Cory Bernardi

TEXT:

Greens Party Leader Richard Di Natale has today been spotted talking to a practicing Voodoo witch doctor in the streets of Collingwood, in a last ditch effort to compromise the rise of the far-right.

Not one to shy from his interest in the alternative lifestyle, last month the Senator spoke to the Betoota Advocate about how leaving his semi-precious crystals out during a full moon was an important part of recharging his spiritual energy while in Canberra.

Following the resignation of rival Senator Cory Bernardi from the Liberal Party Of Australia, Richard Di Natale is believed to be very concerned about the amount of options voters now have outside of the left.

This is why he needs to put a stop to it, by visiting a Haitian mambo in the streets of West Collingwood.

“I don’t want to hurt him… I’d never want that… But can you make something happen to his tongue?” he asked the practitioner, by the name of Fabiola Stefanié.

“I don’t usually do this… But I’m at a loss. My party aren’t listening. No one is listening. I need to take this into my own hands”

According to the Greens Party website: Houngans (Male Vodou Priest) or Mambos (Female Vodou Priest) are usually people who were chosen by the dead ancestors and received the divination from the deities while he or she was possessed. His or her tendency is to do good by helping and protecting others from spells, however they sometimes use their supernatural power to hurt or kill people.

This marks a turbulent return to Parliament for Richard Di Natale, who last week told the Betoota Advocate that he believed 2017 would be his year, after squeezing in one last ‘bush doof’ over the summer break.

Cory Bernardi’s New Political Party To Build A Wall Around Sydney’s Oxford Street

TEXT:

Rogue South Australian Senator Cory Bernardi is expected to rock Australian centre-right politics to its core tomorrow with his resignation from the Liberal Party.

Bernardi is believed to be preparing to to head his own conservative movement, in a stunning move that will make life much harder for the Turnbull government as Parliament returns for the new political year.

Senator Bernardi informed his staff of his decision to defect from the party he has represented in the Senate for a decade. He will join the crossbench as an independent conservative senator for South Australia, fearing that minor parties will continue to rise if right-wing voters aren’t given a ‘respectable’ alternative.

It is believed that first on the agenda for Bernardi’s new political party. A Trump-style wall around Sydney’s rainbow hub of Darlinghurst.

“Darlinghurst isn’t sending us their best people” he said.

“We will build a wall, and the gays will pay for it”

“Obviously, I still don’t support gay marriage. It goes against my conservative interpretation of what weddings look like”

“I never have, and never will, give those gays an inch”

However, one local gay, Tony, says there already is the infrastructure to keep gays in Darlinghurst.

“There already is a Stonewall. It keeps all of us here. Why would you want to go anywhere else? The music is great”

While taking a break from all of the political in-fighting that has plagued his party over the Summer break, Greens Party leader Senator Di Natale has managed to squeeze in one more ‘Bush Doof’ before returning to the Federal upper house.

The Senator says he feels “refreshed, enlightened and full of positive energy” after the three day rave sabbatical in rural Victoria.

“I needed this” he says.

“As a doctor, I am very aware of the correlation between lifestyle and mind. But people often forget that spirituality plays a role there as well”

“Unwinding comes in many shapes and sizes. Personally, I find the most effective way to do it is through three days barefoot with a community of rogue savages and a heightened state of mind”

“The music was so lit”

Last week it was revealed that factional battles erupting under the surface for weeks became public overnight with current and former members of the party openly disagreeing over which member is best suited to collect about 10% of the vote at the next election.

“They might not know it yet. But I think they’ll end up agreeing on having me retain the role as party leader” he said.

“I have done a lot of thinking. A lot contemplation. A shaman at the doof told me that my energy is right. This is the year”

Pauline Declines Lambie’s Offer To ‘Cash Me Ousside” After Women’s March Comments

TEXT:

While awaiting next week’s return to the Federal Senate, Pauline Hanson is believed to ‘fallen back’ from her comments about the international Women’s March, after Supermum Senator Lambie offered to throw down.

This comes after the One Nation leader Senator Hanson took aim at those who took part in marches against Donald Trump in both Australia and the US to march for women’s rights.

In a scathing attack on the thousands of protestors, Hanson said “It’s good that they were out and about and doing a bit of walking because it looked like a few of them needed to get a bit of sun and do a bit of exercise.”

“Don’t these clowns have anything else better to do with their time other than to hold sad, anti-democracy protests?

However, the far more intimidating Senator and shining beacon of a free speech, Senator Jacqui Lambie, was quick to respond to these comments in Canberra this morning.

It is believed that Lambie, a proud mother and supporter of girls doing it for themselves, offered Pauline Hanson to ‘cashh me ousside, how bout dah?’ in response to the One Nation leaders comments about the physical appearance of Australian women.

Senator Hanson was reportedly very rattled, and has since apologised.

Speaking to The Betoota Advocate today, Lambie says she wasn’t far off going full ‘Burnie’ on the former fish and chip shop owner from Ipswich.

“That’s how we get down in Tassie. Even the girls can throw hands and that’s how we go”

Media Asks NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian If She Is More Of A Carrie Or A Samantha

TEXT:

As Mike Baird announced his retirement from the position of NSW Premier, Gladys Berejiklian steps to the fore, ready to assume the role as the first female Liberal leader to ever do so.

Just a few days after being prompted with the pressing matter of her child status, the media has come forth with the equally pressing and exceedingly relevant matter of whether she identifies with Carrie (portrayed by Sarah Jessica Parker) or Samantha (portrayed by Kim Cattrall) from HBO’s hit series, Sex in the City.

“It comes as an issue of great importance,” explains Darren Rogers, political correspondent for the Daily Telegraph. “Whether Premier Berejiklian is a Carrie or Samantha speaks deeply to the psychology of her leading style. Obviously, Carrie being more emotional, seeking widespread approval, and textbook a populist. Whereas Samantha is more outspoken, and won’t take no mess. A more polarizing leader. Margaret Thatcher was totally a Samantha.”

“I mean, this is just basic science,” says Ken Gregory, second year medical student at the University of Sydney, and former rugby prodigy. “We should totally be tracking her menstrual cycle as well. You know. Just in case.”

A royal commission has since been organized in order to attain a definite answer, along with answers to other burning questions as what she will be wearing each week, who she is rooting for in The Bachelorette, and if she want to go on a date. Developments to come.

Mike Baird Rushing To Find A Venue To Host His 2-And-Half Hour Farewell Party

As the Premier Of New South Wales has today decided to become an ‘everyday Australian’ once again, he is now faced with the gruelling task of finding a venue to host his farewell drinks, due to start at 7:00pm, and finish at roughly 9:30pm.

As a result of the lock-out laws (also known as The Hillsong Sharia), implemented by Baird’s NSW Liberal Government, the outgoing Premier is now struggling to find a venue withing twenty kilometres of the Parliamentary chambers that would be ‘all good with staying open a bit past nine’.

Local publican, Shane O’Hennessy says there’s no point in keeping the pub open past nine because no one is giving it a nudge anymore.

“If you are out for a night on the tiles, it’s rare that you would bother staying out if you knew 11:30 was the latest you could go till”

“Not to mention the fact that you can’t buy take away bottles after that time. Or get any public transport home”

“Most people just buy grog after work and bring there need to unwind home with him. It’s probably got a bit to do with our nation’s toxic closeted drinking problem. Oh, and you know, all the domestic violence”

Baird, who claims to have himself been ‘a bit tipsy’ after the Socceroos finals dash in 2006, says he’s not used to organising normal social outings and didn’t realise how hard it was to get a drink in Sydney ever since he introduced the moral compass for Sydney residents that was aimed at keeping women covered and restricting alcohol.

“Man, not one of these places will give me a function room after eight. It’s a real fuddy-duddy”

“I might have to take the party back over to Manly. Things are pumping in my home electorate. Jeez it’s like these CBD venues want to go broke. ”

Bondi Nightclub Promoter Certain He Had Something To Do With Baird’s Resignation

TEXT:

NSW Premier Mike Baird has today declared that he is retiring from politics.

Mr Baird made the announcement this morning that it was time for him to to come good as a Liberal State Premier and not finish the full term he was elected for.

“Serving as premier of NSW has been a tremendous honour, but I have made clear from the beginning that I was in politics to make a difference, and then move on. After 10 years in public life, this moment for me has arrived,” he said in a statement.

However, on the other side of Sydney, away from Baird’s comfortable Manly electoral office, in another beach front suburb – with very similar demographics and socio-economics – Bondi nightclub promoter, Raj McConelly (29) is celebrating the revolution.

“We did it guys” he says to his six housemates.

“This is a true sign of the power held by Sydney’s youth”

Like many other ex-private schoolers who are waiting for their grandparents fortune, Raj has been campaigning, three to four times a fortnight, on social media, to bring an end to the Baird Government’s ‘archaic’ lock out laws.

“Gentrification is killing this city” he says while stirring his $7 almond milk half-caf.

“These laws have all but killed a night economy. We couldn’t stay silent any longer”.

With Baird’s resignation to be effective from next week, it is believed that Raj is not the only one who will be taking credit for the most recent resignation of a NSW Premier.

Orange-based greyhound trainer, Keith Bruce (55), says that ‘Baird flew too close to the sun’.

“He pissed off the wrong people!” he roars.

“We mightn’t look like much. Sure, most of us look like two-bit criminals. But we have a voice and we were heard”

Meanwhile, in Coffs Harbour, an unofficial environmentalist by the name of Banjo Clementé also believes he is responsible for Baird’s resignation.

“The shark nets were a step too far”

“He’s a dictator. I’m glad to see the back of him”.

It is not yet known how many 55-year-old Greens voters from Sydney’s Inner-West are claiming the resignation as a win for their anti-WestConnex community action group.

Following the news that One Nation leader Pauline has pledged to ban the burqa from all government buildings if her party wins the Queensland state election, some of the lower-profile migrant communities are now worried that the champion of white working class insecurities will turn her laser towards them.

“We are quite worried” says African-Australian Gatluak Deng in a broad Logan accent.

“All it’s going to take is an African face on a police sketch and then we are all tarnished by Pauline”

“I’m going to ban the burqa in government buildings and banks and schools,’ Senator Hanson said.

He says his interest in spirit science has a large influence on not only his politics but also his daily rituals.

“Several of my crystals have vibrational frequencies that align with the moon in general, no matter what phase the moon is in at that particular time. But full moons are always the most energetic”

Vietnam Vets Accused Of Taking Tax-Payer Funded Helicopters To Liberal Party Function

TEXT:

Federal Health Minister Sussan Ley will stand aside without pay while a review is undertaken into claiming of travel entitlements for a May 2015 trip to the resort city where she impulse purchased a $795,000 apartment from a Liberal Party donor.

This comes not even eighteen months after Brownwyn Bishop’s Choppergate, that saw her resign after her abuse of travel entitlements that saw her take a helicopter from Melbourne to Liberal Party function Geelong, a distance that is easily covered by car or train.

However, Federal Politicians aren’t the only ones being held accountable by the tax-payer.

Labor Party leaders have today delved into the fact that over 61,000 Australians travelled by tax-payer funded helicopters throughout south-east Asia to attend a series of Liberal Party Functions between 1962 –1972.

In 1962, Prime Minister Robert Menzies and the rest of his Liberal Government sent 30 Australian military advisers to Vietnam to help train the South Vietnamese Army. In November 1964, the Commonwealth Parliament reintroduced compulsory military service for 20-year-old men.

By early 1965, Menzies announced the decision to send a battalion of combat troops to Vietnam. The Australian Labor Party (ALP) and its leader Arthur Calwell were strongly opposed to Australia taking part in the war. In June, Menzies declared that Australia was at war in Vietnam. This resulted in thousands of tax-payer funded helicopter rides.

The official estimate of the cost of Vietnam war for Australia was $218.4 million from 1962 to March 1972 – not including the death, suffering and trauma that the predominantly working class Australian personnel were exposed to.

This was Australian’s biggest military commitment until the recent war on Afghanistan.

Current leader of the opposition, Bill Shorten MP has said that his party were always vehemently opposed to the idea of the Vietnam War, and that he probably would have done something about it if he was alive at the time.

“I probably would have. It’s hard to tell”

“But Christ. Everyone’s getting worked up about a tax-payer flight trip to the Goldie… How about that ten year military exercise in Indo-China?”

Citing ‘strict self-control’ and ‘discipline in regard to portion control and healthy dining’, 62-year-old has received widespread support on his journey on social media.

However, The Advocate has yet to receive comment on the alleged ‘hand-me-down’ deal from the Christensen camp.

His media advisor explained that it’s hard to coax George off his jet ski at this time of year, but he remained hopeful that he’d be able to provide comment this afternoon before his nap.

Aboriginal Ringer Agrees With Pauline On Everything Except The Bit About Him Not Existing

TEXT:

Betoota stockman, Andy Vandercoup, says that as a full time cattleman he is naturally quite conservative.

He doesn’t care too much for the Queensland Labor Government’s attempts at disempowering his local area by restricting graziers rights to land clearing. He also doesn’t like terrorism.

It is for these reasons, and many others, that he will probably see himself steering away from the major parties in the upcoming state election.

Andy says surprisingly, he is looking towards the far-right on the Australian political spectrum because he reckons the Greens don’t give a shit about him and anyone else in between have their snouts in the trough.

However, there is one problem. Andy is from a long line of Aboriginal stockmen, and doesn’t like being told that his background is undefinable.

“Jeez. Pauline would have my vote in a heartbeat if she didn’t spend 25 years systematically berating my people and blaming us for the suburban white mans problems” he says

“There’s plenty of other people to blame, why me fuck ya”

His comments come after the One Nation Senator said there was no definition of Aboriginal in an interview on the Bolt Report last week.

“What defines an Aboriginal?” Senator Hanson told host Andrew Bolt.

“…if the community or the elders accept you into that community, you can be defined as an Aboriginal”

Andy says that’s not a good way to win over blackfellas.

“Yeah. Look we don’t ask for much. No one really talks about us anyway, so if you are gonna talk about us try and say something that at least suggests we exist”

Last week it was revealed that the NRL Indigenous All Stars Team was to be renamed ‘Undefinable Race Of Generally Better Footballers’ – following these comments made by the ever powerful senator.

Andy has said that Pauline has no respect for the Murris and that he’ll be voting for his Uncle Bob Katter every election forever.

Report: Dick Smith Probably Says Horrifying Things About Brown People After A Few Reds

TEXT:

Following revelations that Australia food and electronics magnate, Dick Smith, has become a full-blown North Shore baby boomer, a study has been released by a leading sociological Government research body which was determined to find out what kind of bloke he would be at a dinner party.

The former Australian of the Year has this week publicly thrown his support behind One Nation leader Pauline Hanson, saying he is aligned with her tough immigration stance and other policy positions.

Mr Smith has offered to advise Ms Hanson as she seeks to expand One Nation’s support into key state and federal seats.

Lead researcher, Professor Ken Nagas from the Centre For Research Into Pointless Political Opinions, says that while Dick Smith came into the public eye as a beacon of optimistic environmentalism, it looks as though he has just turned into a bitter old fart from the North Shore of Sydney.

“I think Dick Smith probably starts a few conversations by saying ‘I’m not racist but..’ or even the old ‘I’ve got nothing against these people but…’ – either way, I reckon he’d be hard work after a few reds”

Professor Nagas says that although Dick Smith once was considered an authority on sustainability and decentralising urban areas, it seems his plan all along was to just make Australia a bit whiter and a little less crowded.

“I guess you could make a stretch between immigrants and the environment… but I don’t think Pauline cares too much about the environment”

“Can you imagine the things he says about brown people after a few. Holy shit”

Local Man Can’t Believe That The Psychopaths He Voted For Aren’t Getting Along

TEXT:

Local man, Breece Birley (32) says he is a little disappointed to learn that the One Nation party is starting to crack.

“It’s a shame mate. They were really onto something”

“I can’t believe that a party of four federal senators with no experience working with anyone else weren’t able to tackle Canberra head on”

Birley says that five months ago the idea of voting for completely unqualified climate denying xenophobes was the best option he had, given his hatred of the political class.

“All pollies are crooks mate” he says.

“At least Pauline and the rest of her mob seemed like real people. Well that’s what I thought, until I started hearing some of the shit they were saying once they got in”

“Not sure how I feel about Pauline’s comments about women in abusive relationships. Bit too spicy that stuff”

However, despite the PUP-style infighting, Birley says he still has confidence in the populist anti-establishment politicians.

“Seeing Malcolm Roberts picking fights with the bureau of meteorology reminds me of when me Dad used to yell at the weatherman each night after he’d had a couple. It’s really quite comforting”

“It reminds me that I don’t always have to listen to people that are smarter than me”

He also says he can see the individual strengths of each on the extremist candidates, as they work towards toppling the idea of multiculturalism and look after white working class Australians for the first time since last election.

“You’ve got Pauline with her media experience, appearing on Sunrise each week during the campaign”

“…and Culleton is really good with his words too – it’s just what Canberra needs. He’s like the Honey Badger”

“And Burston is a good Cessnock boy. It means he knows what it’s like to be trodden on”

Majority Of Tony Burke’s Public Appearances Spent Explaining That He Isn’t Andrew Gaze

TEXT:

The Member for Watson’s office have today confirmed that majority of Tony Burke’s public appearances are spent explaining to punters that he isn’t that bloke who played in the NBL between 1985 and 2005.

This comes as the former ALP Minister for the Arts and Immigration was seen informing several of his own constituents in Lakemba that he is not Andrew Gaze.

“No. I know I look like him. But I’ve never played basketball” he patiently explained.

“Yeah, I get that a bit. But no, I’m your Federal Member for Parliament? You are from around here right?”

“Yeah, no need to bring him on your iPhone. I’ve seen him before. Plenty of times”

“Yeah. You’re right. He was a hell of a player”

Speaking to the Betoota Advocate today, his media advisor, Nikki explained that being confused with the current head coach of the Sydney Kings has been one of the biggest day-to-day hurdles faced by Tony Burke MP throughout his whole political career.

“It’s hard for him” she explained.

“He’s probably the least athletic person in his whole family. But by some twist of cruel fate he ends up looking exactly like a 7-times NBL MVP”

Burke was first elected to public office in 2003 as a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council. In October 2004 Burke moved from state to federal parliament in an attempt to relocate from the Australian basketball heartland of Sydney after growing tired of people congratulating him on his retirement from the NBL

Julian Assange admits he passes time watching State of Origin highlights

TEXT:

AFTER HIS INTERNET WAS CUT off by the Ecuadorian government over the Hillary Clinton email leak, Australian superspy Julian Assange has been passing the time in a matter more befitting of a man from North Queensland.

The Townville-born activist revealed this morning that he’s been passing the time watching State of Origin highlights recently after being gifted a DVD collection of the gladiatorial sporting contest by High Commissioner Alexander Downer.

“I’m just doing what any good Queenslander does when they’re bored shitless,” said Assange. “Mark Coyne’s try in Game I 1994 is my favourite all-time Origin moment. I’ve nearly fucken [sic] worn out the DVD from rewinding it.”

Speaking to The Advocate through the second story window while he enjoyed some Lucky Strike lung candy, Assange said that there’s not much to do around the embassy without internet. He’s hoping that it’ll be restored soon.

“You can only watch Steve Price get his brain deactivated so many times in one lifetime. So far, I’ve seen Trent Waterhouse commit attempted murder over a hundred times. While it is classic, I’m pretty over it by now.”

“But I if anybody reading this is in London and has access to the Cowboy’s grand final win, can you please throw it up on the balcony for me? I still haven’t seen it. Just knock on the door of one of the black vans out the front and let them know what you’re doing,”

“Otherwise, they might think you’re a spy and shoot you. Tell them you’re just delivering a copy of the greatest sporting moment in Australian history.”

Assange then enjoyed the last millimetres of his cigarette, then flicked it out the window.

“Gotta run, mate. Mark Carrol just called cattledog.”

Bill Clinton greens out at 9pm, hours earlier than predicted

CLINTON AIDES SWARMED to Bill’s side earlier tonight as he slumped forward in his seat and vomited all over his shoes.

Cameras then observed the former president’s eyes roll back into his head and a gurgling noise was heard as he tried to swallow his tongue.

Moments before the medical emergency, the 70-year-old was seen smoking a cigarette with Bon Jovi drummer, Tico Torres.

However, Torres later confirmed to doctors that the cigarette was, indeed, a marijuana cigarette.

NYPD and DEA officers have since placed Torres under arrest for possession and supply of a banned substance. He’ll also be required to pay damages should he be convinced.

The former president battled his marijuana demons for most of his political career, after publically stating for the record that he ‘puffed, but did not inhale’ on a joint while in college.

Clinton is being treated by doctors and paramedics at the scene, who are reassuring him that he’s not dying and that the false euphoria he’s feeling now will soon be over.

Jeb Bush lets out a big heavy sigh and wonders what could’ve been

TEXT:

KICKING HIS SHOES OFF and settling in for a sleepless night of election coverage, former presidential hopeful Jeb Bush let out a loud sigh as he slumped down on the couch of his Florida home tonight – wondering what could’ve been.

The 63-year-old suspended his campaign for the White House after the South Carolina primaries in February. It was a lacklustre result for Bush, who decided to officially endorse Senator Ted Cruz shortly after.

Speaking candidly to The Advocate this morning, Bush said he remained optimistic for the future and declined to rule out running again in 2020.

“I mean, it’s pretty deflating knowing that this Trump goon was more popular than you,” he said. “You can’t help but wonder what could’ve been, you know? What if I was up on that stage.

Though The Betoota Advocate was the only newspaper aside from the Tampa Bay Times to officially endorse Jeb Bush for president, it wasn’t enough to win over the silent, disenfranchised majority that guided Trump to power.

“People say that America deserves more than Bush, Clinton, Bush, Obama, Clinton – but I say they deserve Bush more than Clinton. Personally, I hope that this was all a ruse on Hillary’s part to win power, then blow and intern. All just to get back at Bill. That’s what I’m hoping for.”

“This is all off the record, right?”

As polling closes around the US in the coming hours, the next president of the United States will become clear as the afternoon rolls on local time.

ISIS Waiting On Trump To Be Officially Elected Before Claiming Victory Over World

As Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton make the final dash in their election campaigning, the United States’ most outspoken enemy is eagerly awaiting the official result, before announcing whether or not they have succeeded in their quest to end Western Civilisation.

The Republican candidate has today said he is the “last chance” to fix a broken country while his Democratic rival has said a “moment of reckoning” has arrived.

Meanwhile, holed up in the Islamic State capital of Raqqa, one ISIS member says the news will mean much more to his organisation than most people think.

“Essentially, if Trump wins, we win” says the middle-ranking ISIS spokesperson, Keith* (named changed)

“They’ve essentially played into our hands if a reality TV star becomes President”

Keith* says defeating the American empire was just a matter of scaring US citizens into voting for Donald Trump.

“We set out to destroy the United States, and we are almost there… Just waiting to see if they go all the way with flipping their entire political system upside down”

“We’ve seen it in England with Brexit, we’ve seen it in Australia with One Nation. The first thing people do when they are scared is listen to idiots”

Report concludes only 11 Australians actually honestly care about US Election

TEXT:

THOUGH THE MEDIA KEEP ramming the rise of Trump and US Election news down the throats of the average punter, a recent study has found only 11 people in Australia care about the result.

A combination of over-saturation and honest disinterest has been blamed for the lack of enthusiasm around election news, the study concluded.

The lack of a diverse format has also left viewers and readers alike feeling let down, with TV crews vox popping Trump supporters until one of them says something shocking and newspapers running highly-stylised editorials that take thousands of words of argument to conclude that Trump is bad for America.

“It’s just too much,” said Alice Carnegie, a 24-year-old Brisbane economics student.

“Coming into this election, I did actually have some vague interest in following it. But that soon disappeared when it was honestly all I ever saw on Australian news website. I don’t care anymore.” she explained.

Ms Carnegie’s sentiments were echoed by Nathan Decanter, who spends his Tuesdays throwing rocks at cars passing his Jimbooma home. The 38-year-old said his interest waned when he saw that both Trump and Clinton’s supporters were both being unfairly represented by each political side of the media.

“You’ve got FOX unfairly painting Clinton’s supporters as supporters of high treason and Israel, then you’ve got pinko propaganda rags like the New York Times comparing Trump to Hitler,” he said.

“I’m sorry, but until Trump starts rounding people up based on their religion and ethnicity and putting them in camps, he’s not that bad. I’m still on the fence,”

“I am but a simple man who enjoys throwing rocks at cars. This election has been too much for me.”

Barnaby Joyce Dresses As Greens Party Leader For Halloween At Parliament House

The Deputy Prime Minister has stolen the show at the poorly-attended inaugural Parliament House halloween party.

Dressed as Greens Party leader, Richard Di Natale, Barnaby Joyce rocked up to the multi-faith prayer room in the Ministerial Wing wearing a black kashmir turtleneck sweater with a Greens Australia badge as well as marijuana leaf pinned to his chest.

“I just came as the scariest thing I could think of” said Mr Joyce, between explosions of red-faced laughter.

“Talk about witchcraft… Let me tell you about solar power [laughter]”

“Ooog booga!” he roared, while making ghostlike expressions with his fingers.

Other outfits on the night included Christopher Pyne’s attempt at pulling off Peta Credlin, complete with a giant head of long brown hair and cushions in his ‘rump’.

Sam Dastyari seemed to have misunderstood the theme and came dressed as a halal snack pack, he then proceeded to tell anyone who would listen that halal snack packs are cool in Sydney’s inner-west.

Turnbull Fondly Remembers When He Had Control Over The LNP, As The Packer Family Lawyer

TEXT:

With Malcolm Turnbull’s approval rating lower than it was when his predecessor sent him the hospital pass as the role of Minister for Communication, the Prime Minister is today reminiscing about his time as someone who actually had control of the LNP.

Speaking to the press gallery today, Turnbull says he can’t believe that voters were more supportive of him when he was gifted the task of slashing money to the public broadcaster and implementing a copper wire NBN to regional Australia.

“Never did I think that I would be less popular than I was back then, let alone less popular than the Prime Minister I was serving under at the time,” he said.

“I was certain, after the spill, that I would be the man that lead the LNP into the 20th century,”

With a growing far-right faction within the Liberal National Party Coalition, Turnbull says he feels more and more powerless every day – as a man who is willing to shake hands with homosexuals and believes there may be some merit in the internationally recognised concept of climate change.

“This plebiscite thing really went pear-shaped didn’t it? It’s not like my days as a CEO – when I knew what was best and people did what I said. Give me a stubborn board of executives any day over the likes of Christensen,”

“I just wish Kerry was still alive. I know these people would listen to me if he was. It wasn’t like this in the 80s”.

As Turnbull points out, the most control he has ever had over the LNP at both state and federal level, was when he was working as the family lawyer for media tycoon Kerry Packer.

“Maaate, when you are dealing with that much money. Politicians seem to just forget their religious affiliations,”

“Faaaark we used to just rock in and out of a Royal Commission like it was the members at Randwick,”

“The bloke invented world series cricket, even the most feral Union types would shut up when we walked into a room,”

With Turnbull’s predecessor and lifelong enemy, Tony Abbott MP, gaining momentum with his constant appearance on 2GB, even though he was not considered the preferred leader when he was ousted two years ago – Turnbull’s neck is on the chopping block.

“I dunno what I’m gonna do, aye” he said to the journalists in Parliament courtyard this morning.

“Maybe I’ll just go hard on boats. That’ll give the polls a sugar hit until the new year I reckon.”

NSW Premier Mike Baird Celebrates The Last Wog Moving Out Of Kings Cross

TEXT:

NSW Premier Mike Baird was seen last night enjoying several responsible, early-evening, mid-strength beverages – as he met with advisors to celebrate the last man of western oriental heritage moving out of Kings Cross.

Mr Baird was in high spirits as he allowed himself to unwind, but not too much, as he congratulated himself for ‘getting rid of the wogs and homosexuals’ from the iconic district of inner Sydney.

This represents a landmark achievement for the Baird Government, who have worked hard towards ‘cleaning up’ inner-east Sydney, on behalf of hundreds of elderly anglo-saxon professionals who now depend on property investments to survive because they have lost their businesses to the internet.

This comes after the news that the former-vibrant nightlife district will be rezoned to make way for two high-rise buildings modelled on Malaysia’s Petronas Towers, comprising 500 luxury apartments with a starting price of about $1 million each.

“[laughter] … probably couldn’t have done it if it wasn’t for a couple blonde haired private school kids biting the dust,” says one of his Hillsong-associated political advisors.

“But yes… Yes on a more serious note. What happened to them was very tragic,”

“However, we can’t deny it gave us the perfect excuse to drag a net through the cross and remove all of the homosexuals and lebs. Not to mention the hookers,”

“It’s laughable to think that these people thought they deserved to live that close to the CBD in 2016,”

The Premier also gave comment on the official transition of the cities old red light district, one that was created through appropriated statistics surrounding alcohol-related violence and the selective value of human lives and livelihoods.

“Everyone is happy about the result, especially Fairfax Media. This injection of thousands of new inner city apartments will give them at least 18 months breathing space,”

“I don’t know what they’d do if they couldn’t flog apartments on Domain,”

“But yeah, we’ve just finished building the funnel between Wynyard station and Barangaroo. Anyone who wants to drink all night should head there,”

“I’m very thankful that my God allows gambling or this city would be dead [laughter].”

NSW Premier Mike Baird Spotted Backflipping After Bag Of Cash At Dapto Greyhounds

TEXT:

NSW Premier Mike Baird has been spotted backflipping down the Dapto Greyhound Racing Club last night, racing against the other dogs present at the track.

It is believed that the track’s motorised ‘jack rabbit’ was fitted with a brown paper bag full of money, as Baird competed with the popular racing dogs for his prize.

It is believed a battered, puffed and noticeably unpopular Baird was able to leave the race track with the money in the boot of his sea-salt battered BMW 4WD.

Mr Baird has denied that he has been live baited by the blood of Christ leading up to his controversial back flipping in 2016.

In a bizarre coincidence, today New South Wales Premier Mike Baird says he ditched a ban on greyhounds because he “got it wrong” and believes the majority of the community wants the industry to have a second chance.

NSW cabinet ministers this morning officially signed off on a plan to reverse the greyhound racing ban.

Baird has been lambasted for his peculiar behaviour by his Hillsong-associated advisors today, after previously promising them that the CBD location for Wentworth Park was to be handed over to the church as an inner-city megachurch.

Senator Dastyari Laying Low At His Cousin’s Place In Lakemba For A Few Months

Following Sam Dastyari’s resignation from a shadow frontbench position earlier this month, it is believed that the Labor Senator has been ‘laying low’ at his cousin’s place in Lakemba until things cool off.

The resignation saw the end to week-long saga over a Chinese company having covered his travel expenses, a  payment which led many to question his support for China in the South China Sea dispute in defiance of Labor policy.

Speaking to the Betoota Advocate today, ‘Dasher’ as he is collaquially known in the hood, told us that he’s not the first member of his family to get sent to Uncle Reza’s house for straightening out.

“When my other cousin, Nick, wrote off his old man’s car – he had to do about four month’s at Reza’s,” he said.

“When his little brother got caught with pingers. Jesus. He spent a fair bit of time in Lakemba,”

The Iranian-born Federal Politician has for many years spoken about his loving arabic background, and it would seem that in the peak of his political controversy, it is only his family that are looking after him.

“Nah, haven’t heard much from Bill [Shorten], hey”

“I’ve been out of the loop. Chilling out at my cousin’s place. Keeping out of trouble,”

“Just until this all cools down… Which will probably be on the third libspill. I’m backing that to happen before Christmas,”

Not even Tony Abbott can’t quite believe how much of a train wreck Malcolm Turnbull has become

TEXT:

THE FORMER PRIME MINISTER today looked on in horror while the political career of Malcolm Turnbull slowly jumped off the rails this afternoon as his same-sex marriage plebiscite was shot down by the Opposition.

“I mean, just look at the cunt, but. He’s aged about five years and he’s got pretty much everybody in Canberra leading him around by the dick. I feel bad for the bloke,” said Abbott.

“Only the sinners and lefties hated me, I can live with. But Turnbull’s loathed by half his own party and basically every other person here. The ones that do like the poor bastard are disappointed in him.”

“Dunno how he does it.” he said.

This afternoon, Labor all but sunk the Coalition’s same-sex marriage plebiscite, shadow Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus cited that it’s “just not a policy we can get the boys around, you know.”

That leaves the prime minister in an awkward position, where he needs to eat some humble pie, or have Corey Bernardi’s legs broken.

ASIO confirmed last week that they received a directive from the PM’s office, asking if they were allowed to have people shot, or if that was just an urban legend John Howard made up to impress Helen Clarke.

As the news filtered through the lower house this afternoon, Tony Abbott’s media advisor interrupted his 3pm Sharpie marker sniffing session with George Christensen to deliver him the news.

Christensen was seated cross-legged on the floor, chroming his favourite Schwarzkopf hairspray.

Upon learning of the news, he deeply inhaled from the bag and collapsed backwards onto the carpet, speaking in tongues while his eyes rolled wildly around in his head.

“He does this when he’s happy,” said Abbott.

“If he starts choking on his tongue, can you help me roll him on his side?”

Hanson And Roberts Develop New Policies On Climate Change After Big Youtube Sesh

In a candid interview with the Advocate, One Nation Senator Malcom Roberts revealed that all of his polices stem from YouTube material.

“Pauline and I have spent a lot of time together researching what they don’t want us, and you, to know!” Roberts said.

“Last night we were up until 4:00 am learning the facts about Islam and Climate Change. I offered her one of my very own aluminium headpieces but she didn’t want to mess up her hair” he said.

“After hours of research on the UncenSAWED NeWz69 YouTube channel… I can tell you the rot that the CSIRO and our small ‘L’ Prime Minister spit out is complete rubbish,”

Senator Roberts explained that There have been many late nights dedicated to “venturing down the rabbit hole,”

“I feel that it’s my duty to wake Australia up. To give them some facts that isn’t spoon fed to them by those Jew’s, the Rothschild’s.”

After demanding to know what happened to Building 7, Roberts said that the wherabouts of Harold Holt was the last of his worries.

“I worry what the Chinese did to our former Prime Minister, but at the same time it’s low on my list of concerns,”

“We are being by swamped by Muslims, made to pay for climate change that doesn’t exist and are on the verge of been enslaved by the Hillsong Church. It’s time we wake some of these sheeple up,” he spits in fury.

On climate change the senator told the Advocate“It’s all there. It’s all there. Everything. Prove to me that NASA isn’t perverting the data on climate change? It’s all a giant scam to channel funds into the coffers of those Jewish bankers.”

Roberts says he subscribes to numerous Aussie Patriot channels because at least they are “trying to do something about this invasion that we are facing. We have already lost three people to Islamic terrorism.”

“If you leave it to these latte sipping lefties, we will be under Sharia law and living in a caliphate (is that what you call it?) in no time.”

Pauline Hanson explained that Roberts is her most trusted source in these uncertain times.

“Look, I know that when I talk to Malcom, he knows what he is talking about and he is being straight forward with me,” she said.

“I’ve never been big on the research side of my political policies, so Senator Roberts has been a big help,”

Hanson signed off with “You will be hearing a lot more from Malcolm and I, and they will try silencing us. Because we are dangerous, and what we know is dangerous. But we won’t be silenced.”

Adelaide Still Trying With This Radelaide Thing

TEXT:

Despite decade-long campaigns by Triple J to promote the South Australian capital as a cool and exciting destination for young people, a recent visitor to the town has confirmed she will no longer be referring to Adelaide as ‘Radelaide’.

“I was always keen to visit Adelaide, but I’ve since realised it is not really that rad,” says Laura (29) from Wagga.

According to UrbanDictionary.com, ‘Radelaide’ is slang term for the city of Adelaide, South Australia. Often used by those who enjoy the sights, lifestyle and culture of Australia’s 5th-most-populated city.

After four nights in the southern township, Laura disagrees with this title.

“It’s for newlyweds and nearly-deads. I would not live there unless I was a retired or broke,”

“I actually spent the week visiting churches. How fucked is that?”

With a very short list of well-known former residents, many locals and tourists can confirm that Adelaide is nice – but not exciting.

Local young person, Tim (19), says that Adelaide isn’t as cool as Triple J announcers would suggest.

“It might have been cool when Jimmy Barnes was still doing pub gigs, or when the Hilltop Hoods were around, but most of the cool people leave this place hey,”

“Farnham wasn’t really that cool to begin with. Other than that, it’s pretty much just Chris Pyne or Julia Gillard – and those two people epitomise uncool,”

With countless failed bids to host the Olympics and FIFA World Cup, even the mayor has publicly admitted that the city is kidding itself.

“[Laughter] Yeah, the IOC have told us that should probably stop bothering with our pipe dreams of hosting an Olympics,” said the mayor.

“As for the Soccer World Cup. I don’t think we’d have enough beds for the players. But we have to at least pretend, right,”

“[Laughter] We don’t mind, though. We’ve got some good cheese and stuff.”

Barnaby Joyce Thrown Out Of Mooseheads For Dropping Pants During Eagle Rock

TEXT:

Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce has been handed a life ban from Mooseheads Pub & Nightclub in Canberra after refusing to leave the venue upon being asked by several security guards.

It is believed that at around 11:55pm last night, the 49-year-old former accountant was given his third and last warning for public nuisance, after dropping his pants and boot-scooting to the iconic Daddy Cool rum anthem ‘Eagle Rock’.

Venue manager, Hugo Van Arkel said Mr Joyce’s first warning came after he was seen drinking Bundaberg Rum and Pepsi out of his own RM Williams Craftman.

“He was walking around the place with one shoe on, making his staffers order him some more ‘sugarcane champagne’ – I didn’t know who it was at first,” said the hospitality professional.

“I initially thought he was one of the footy coaches from the West Belconnen Warriors who might have been still partying after Robert Roberts’ amazing grand final win”

“That was until I got close enough to see that red tint and the scars on his face. Fuck me, he was going full bore.”

Mr Joyce’s second warning came after he demanded that the venues resident disc jockey, DJ Dawson, play some “Fuckin’ Chisel”.

The Deputy Prime Minister made it clear that he had been very underwhelmed by Jimmy Barnes’ performance on Q&A earlier in the evening.

“Play some Flame Trees Godammit!” he shouted.

“I haven’t had a drink in a month – Now i’m all healed up and I wanna hear some fuckin’ Chisel!”

After promising he would behave, the third and final warning came after the band began playing ‘Eagle Rock’.

Barnaby Joyce was seen shimmying with his moleskin trousers around his ankles, while demanding his more timid staffers and National party colleagues join him.

“Get ’em off, Gerard!” he shouted at his media advisor and former Herald Sun writer, Gerard McManus.

“All of youse! Get your eagle out for Eagle Rock!”

Dropping your pants for Eagle Rock has been a peculiar tradition practiced among Western Queenslanders for several decades.

The tradition being, whenever the iconic Australian rock song is played at an event or a public bar, those present (particularly the males) congregate together on the dance floor where they unstrap their belts and hobble around singing the song with their trousers around their ankles. Bushies have been known to request the song in bars while travelling abroad for the purpose of locating fellow countrymen.

Unfortunately, this tradition isn’t much practiced in the three story regional nightclub of Mooseheads, and the Deputy Prime Minister was promptly asked to leave the venue. He refused.

After a thirty minute physical confrontation which turned into a ‘game of tiggy’ between Joyce and up to eight security guards, the second most powerful man in the country was eventually restrained and barrel thrown out of the venue.

Shortly after, the 49-year-old Minister For New England was heard inviting several Samoan bouncers to ‘have a go’ on the street outside the The Academy – where he was also denied entry.

He was later seen ordering a large Zinger Burger and Mountain Dew from the Manuka 24-hour KFC.

George Christensen MP Vows To Save Australian Culture From The 3 Muslims In Mackay

TEXT:

Federal MP, George Christensen has called for immigration to be restricted from countries where political unrest is prevalent.

The Member for Dawson told Parliament that he believes many recent immigrants do not share Australian values, especially the three Muslims who live in his 14,945 square kilometre Electorate in Queensland’s central coast.

Despite his party leader, Malcolm Turnbull, repeatedly describing Australia as the most successful multicultural nation on earth, Mr Christensen told Parliament he was concerned about “the rise of Islamism in this country and those who are willing to commit violence in the name of that ideology”.

Speaking to the Betoota Advocate today, Mr Christensen said the rise of Islam in his electorate has been a very big concern since Kevin Khan opened up a grocery store in 1982.

“These people refuse to assimilate,” says the man who last year called for a Royal Commission into why Sizzlers keep closing down.

“I’ve never seen him at the pub – and his bloody son plays soccer,”

“It’s central f**kin’ Queensland. We don’t play soccer here. That’s not our culture,”

“This is the home of rugby league!”

“I will not have our culture dictated by a family of three highly politicised migrants from fuck knows where,”

Mr Khan has since told the media that while he is Muslim, he was actually born in Mt Isa and hasn’t migrated from anywhere. He also pointed out that his wife used to babysit George Christensen when he was a child.

Pauline Hanson Chants Ancient German Hymn As Eyes Roll Back During Sunrise Interview

TEXT:

The last remaining Australian breakfast TV audiences got to experience a new side to Pauline Hanson this morning, as Sunrise producers accidentally cut live to the One Nation senator several minutes earlier than she had expected.

The live-cross, which has happened every Wednesday morning since the Martin Place siege, was supposed to be a chance for the Senator to talk about Muslim migrants in her role as a Channel Seven’s terrorism expert – a title she has held ever since television producers decided she was worth giving a platform.

However before Sunrise co-host David Koch had even asked any questions about the social issues in suburbs she has never visited, Ms Hanson was caught off-guard and broadcasted live across the country without even knowing.

With her eyes rolled back in to her head. The footage shows the 63-year-old anti-multiculturalist chanting an ancient Germanic hymn while rabidly salivated from the mouth.

“Tsitfel EhT Drawoh Nhoj Yb Degats Boj Edisni Na Saw Ruhtra Trop” chanted the One Nation Senator.

After close to a whole minute, the program cut to commercials and ‘Kochie’ was forced to apologise for the overly serious tone.

One Nation staffer, James Ashby has since apologised on behalf of Pauline Hanson’s ‘weird and seemingly foreign behaviour’ but explained it is nothing more than a pre-interview warm-up ritual taught to the One Nation candidates by some elderly political activists within the far-right.

“Obviously, Pauline is very distressed about being caught off guard this morning, so she has asked me to apologise on her behalf,”

“The weird woggy stuff won’t happen again, but yes, it is a nod to some of our predecessors in the movement,”

However, Dr Brynn Dodson, a linguistic professor from Monash University says the chants coming from Pauline Hanson this morning appear to be a little more than harmless jibberish.

“We are trying our very best to decipher what she was singing about, before it gets laughed off as a Tony Abbott-style political gaffe,” he said.

“The first verse we heard definitely involves some sort of sacred oath to racial purity, but we aren’t sure about the rest at this point,”

“Also the fact that her eyes were rolled back and she was frothing from the mouth makes us think this was a bit more than an old family nursery rhyme,”

“Also there was a few sentences dedicated to something about Tasmania being a myth of something”

The interview has since been uploaded to the Sunrise Facebook page with additional commentary from David Koch as well as a Benny Hill theme sound bed. Facebook users are now commenting on how Pauline Hanson is one of the only politicians who says what they are all thinking.

Turnbull: ‘I have a dream that all gays should be legally allowed to live in sin’

TEXT:

IN AN WISTFUL CALL TO arms, Malcolm Turnbull has asked his political friends and foes to put aside their differences for the greater good of the nation by asking them to clear a path for the same-sex marriage plebiscite today in Canberra.

The prime minister’s pleas come as Opposition leader Bill Shorten has allegedly instructed his MPs to vote against the motion, citing that it’s an ‘irresponsible and unnecessary waste of taxpayer money’.

Speaking to parliament this afternoon, Turnbull made an emotional speech that challenged his colleagues not to let this spiral out of control into another Ute-gate type disaster.

“I have a dream that one day every gay will be legally allowed to live in sin – in a homosexual marriage,” he said.

“The Coalition is united in their quest to make this happen. While I have to technically agree that Jesus and his Dad, or the bloke who wrote the Bible would be too crash hot on this idea, but it’s the best I can do with the hand the Australian public dealt me at the last election,”

“But yeah, I represent one of the largest gay ghettos in Australia and you can take it from me, they’re a bit of all right. Most of you in this parliament wouldn’t have many homosexuals in your electorate, but I’ve got fucking thousands. So does Tan[ya Plibersek] she’s got bloody truckloads of them. That four-eyed smug poon from Melbourne in the red room has a couple, too,”

“We can vouch for them. Just let us pass this plebiscite so we can get on with business.”

The future of Malcolm Turnbull’s plebiscite hangs in the balance this afternoon as the parliament plans to vote on this issue shortly.

Fairfax Welcomes Anti-Gay Marriage Advertisers As Long As They Can Pay Up Front

TEXT:

The latests announcements surrounding campaign funds for an Australian postal vote into the legality of same-sex marriage has put the executive staff members of Fairfax media in somewhat of a difficult position, it has been revealed.

With the news that commercial media enterprises, such as television networks and newspapers, would be paid to carry advertisements for both the “no” and “yes” – the newspaper empire of Fairfax has had to round up all their gay employees and just flat out tell them that they will be cashing in on the homophobic dollar over the next few months, as the plebiscite looms closer.

Speaking to the company’s LGBTIQ employees this morning, Fairfax sales director Nick Maloush warned them all that this next ad campaign might sting a little, but ultimately the clean government cash meant more than their human rights.

“Look, you guys… Um.. Sorry… You people know we are more of a campaign agency now anyway,” he said.

“And if the government is offering us money to run a few anti-gay marriage flyers. You know, we are gonna take the money,”

“This has nothing to do with you, its more about us clutching at straws to maintain a competitive edge over online newspapers who write about cats,”

Maloush points out that taking money from homophobic anti-gay marriage activists is really no different to the series of front pages they ran in support of lock-out laws.

“That coward punch stuff really worked for us. We are now selling ads based off our ability to change laws. That’s no different to this. Front pages are essentially ads in this game nowadays,”

“It’s just that this time we are taking money from Cory Bernardi and not [friends of] Mike Baird”

Local gay employee, Nick Bruce (26) says he’s not too concerned because there is a huge chance that print news will be dead by the time this campaign launches, and he’ll probably be working as a marketing director for an instagram agency in that time.

“Yeah, look. I know how to use social media. I know that there are options outside of print news”

Bill Shorten signs on as Skechers Shape Up! brand ambassador with toned new look

HAVING A PERT DERRIERE IS seemingly compulsory in today’s modern cruel world – and Canberra isn’t immune to the growing trend of looking your best naked.

Everybody from federal members of parliament to your run-of-the-mill junkie yelling in the street is feeling pressured to stay beautiful, with the likes of Opposition leader Bill Shorten and Bachelor host Osher Günsberg being ‘body shamed’ in recent months.

But today, the former has signed onto US footwear giant Sketchers to represent their Shape Up! shoes in Australia and New Zealand.

Opposition leader Bill Shorten has been a fan of the patented sneaker for a number of years now and he’s thought to be the only person in Australia not currently going through menopause to own a pair.

“I don’t think there’s anything strange about a middle-aged man wearing Shape Ups! They’re a good shoe and I’ve been getting great results,” said the perky 49-year-old.

“Feel my arse, just touch it. Touch the bottom part where it turns into my leg, hard right? That’s Shape Ups! for you. Magic shoe, I’d been trying to get my whole cabinet on them. I’ve almost twisted Albo’s arm enough,”

“And all the proceeds earned through my endorsement of these body contouring sneakers will be doing to charity, so those Liberal senators who’ve been calling me out over this, fucking run at me.” he said.

After asking every male reporter in Parliament House to feel his new bum through his Tarocash trousers, Shorten answered a few more questions before declaring that he was going to run in shorts for the first time this year tomorrow morning.

Five Years In The Young Liberal Fails To Impress Local Preppy C-nt’s Dad

TEXT:

22-year-old Young Liberal member, Angus Thorley (22) has today realised that the last five years he has spent wearing Tarocash suits and taking university politics way too seriously, still isn’t enough for dad to love him.

From the moment he finished his end of year exams at high school, Angus has attended fortnightly meetings for the Young Liberals in his local area – in an attempt to win over his Howard-era conservative father who very rarely says nice things to him.

“Ever since I can remember Dad has always been talking about politics and how the Greens are fucking up our country,”

“The moment I left school I bought myself a Tarocash suit and joined my closest branch,”

“After five years of debating, campaigning and working as an unpaid staffer for local candidates. I was promoted to Branch Deputy President”

“I don’t think my dad even knows that I’m a young lib. I don’t even think he knows I still live at home,”

“There’s much better things to do than pissy away all your time in pubs. For example, you can always join Rotary or the young libs. I think the lock-out laws are a good thing for this country”

58-year-old Jock Thorley says Angus was a good kid, but should have stuck with his footy.

“I was putting in a few phone calls during his senior year. I had blokes from the Brumbies and the Reds keen to have a look at the kid – but he comes home one day and tells me he wants to study law,”

“These bloody kids don’t have a clue. I put my neck on the line to get that kid a start in the Super Rugby – but he chose to rebel and waste time on his counterculture rubbish,”

“His academics were never that good, he should have listened to me.”

While wiping tears from his aryan blue eyes – Angus says the Liberal party has gone soft – and that it his duty to bring it back to a level of conservatism that would impress his father – and possibly result in a hug.

“This Turnbull stuff has got to change. For too long we have been pandering to the homosexual left and environmental extremists”

“I will bring this party back to it’s former glory. I will make my father proud,”

George Christensen MP Effeminately Giggles At Abbott’s Joke About Circumcised Penises

TEXT:

Tension has arisen between two of the most quotable members of the Australian Government’s hard-right faction today, as former Prime Minister Tony Abbott vows to distance himself from the Federal Member for Dawson, George Christensen MP.

The split has arisen after Mr Abbott’s recent visit to the outskirts of Mackay, in what many political analysts are calling a pre-spill campaign aimed at encouraging Central Queensland’s conservative voters to get behind their local MP and the hard right faction to which they both belong.

While making a media appearance on a nearby broccoli farm, it appears Mr Abbott couldn’t help but make a ‘cheeky remark’ about how the produce resembled a circumcised penis, or as the former LNP  leader put it “a skivvy dick”.

This one-liner was met with chuckles from both the farmhands and media present, but the jovial atmosphere was quickly made uncomfortable by the hysterical, and effeminate, giggles from George Christensen MP.

“It was quite bizarre,” said one Abbott staffer.

“The big fella found it way too funny,”

“At first, we thought it was him trying to impress Tony, but then he went bright pink and it ramped up even more,”

“It honestly sounded like a high school girl watching Magic Mike…”

Members of the local media who were present say they aren’t sure whether it was the fact that Abbott was making a joke about the male genitals, or the fact that George Christensen has a long documented history of spruiking anti-semitic propaganda – but either way, they all say that they now can understand why Mr Abbott is now distancing himself from the Member For Dawson.

Mackay Hot Hits Radio 97.4 brekky announcer, Nathan Hosemans says Christensen made a real a dick of himself.

“You can’t laugh for that long at a penis joke,” he said.

“Either he’s a closeted homosexual, or he still harbours anti-semitic views. Either way, he’s cooked it”

With Tony Abbott refusing to comment on the incident, it is not yet known if this controversy will result in further factions within the Liberal Party.

If the hard-right faction of the LNP does, in fact, become two new factions, Channel Nine political analyst Laurie Oakes says it was hard to tell which faction is going to be the most right-leaning.

“It comes down to the rotund Mackay Islamophobe who refuses to believe transgender people exist or the hairy bloke from North Shore Sydney who refuses to believe his own sister exists,” said Oakes.

“Either way, this circumcised-penis-joke has been very revealing of both characters.”

NSW Premier Mike Baird Mandates That Sydney Buskers Should Only Play Christian Rock

TEXT:

NSW Premier Mike Baird has today ruled that special NSW state government rangers will be issuing fines to any street artists seen to be performing ‘offensive’ or ‘unsavoury’ music in inner-city Sydney.

While giving the opening speech at the Australian Christian Lobby’s quarterly AGM, the Premier spoke proudly of the transformation Sydney has seen in the 18 months since his predecessor stood down from the role.

“We have seen a lot less of the riff raff that us Christians always worried about,” he said.

“Since implementing the lock-outs laws their has been a 45% decrease in young unmarried women staying out past midnight, and a 80% decrease in homosexuals holding hands in public,”

“But we still do have the issue of unkept young musicians performing music on the street side.”

In his first public appearance at a lobby group function since his tear-jerking sermon at the NSW Women’s Temperance League conference earlier this year, Mike Baird assured all of his evangelical supporters that Sydney city would continue to be much less accessible to arts students and other people who choose to live in sin.

“In my close relationship with Father Brian Houston from the Hillsong Church and NSW Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione – also a devout follower of the Hillsong faith – we have proposed a new set of laws that will make Sydney much more appealing to the true family values of contemporary Australia,”

“From next month, any so-called musician who decides to perform music in our streets will be audited by state rangers. This will help improve not only the quality of street music, but also the content,”

“Gone are the days where Sydney musicians sing about the boys lighting up – we want strictly Christian rock of either the pentecostal variation or anything from the tax-free Hillsong record labels,”

Mr Baird says he knows he will be met with opposition by pagans, but as he has stated before, he does not care about getting re-elected in 2019, and all he has to worry about is whether or not God is happy with him.

“Obviously we have to allow the blacks to keep playing their didgeridoos, but by next year we will have pretty much stamped out all of the inner-city housing commissions from Millers Point through to Waterloo,”

“If any Aboriginal people want to perform in this city they are going to have to catch a loooong train ride [laughter]”

“As for the music industry. I think the record sales speak for themselves, Hillsong musicians sell far more records than any other mucisians, and that money goes to a good cause,”

“In the circumstance that I am met with another fifteen thousand person march against my policies, I will simply call for a review into the laws and not comment on them for eighteen months until everyone forgets about it,”

“All the best, Foley [laughter]”

This announcement comes not even two months after Mike Baird banned both Greyhound Racing, recreational ball pits and oral sex for any Sydney residents under the age of 55.

Brian Cox Not Convinced That One Nation Senator Malcolm Roberts Is Real

TEXT:

Following the embarrassing Climate Change showdown on Q&A last night which saw world-renowned British physicist Brian Cox was forced to explain the concept of temperature to One Nation senator-elect Malcolm Roberts, the visiting professor from Manchester University has today revealed that he is not sure he was even arguing with a real person last night.

Australia’s broken federal senate was on display for all when an audience member director question to the Cox asking him to address Mr Roberts’ request for proof of a human element in climate change.

With great patience the man who has spent most of his life reading books and conducting scientific experiments attempted to explain the “absoluteness” of the human impact on planet earth to the recently elected right-wing senator who has spent most of his life in a coal mine.

However, despite a polite and thorough explanation which was aided by a graph that he had brought along with him, Mr Cox was met with claims that the data he was quoting had been corrupted by NASA.

While seemingly giving up on the possibility of explaining probably the most studied natural catastrophe in human history, Brian Cox OBE was left with no option other than to believe that the man at the other end of the panel was not real.

“I didn’t have much time with him, but the fact that he turned a two-sided discussion about Climate Change into a conspiracy about NASA, makes me think I might have been hallucinating” Cox told the Betoota Advocate this morning.

“It was distressing. Maybe it’s the jetlag. I can only hope its the jetlag”.

“If I am wrong, and in fact this man is real. It is a real concern, because it’s the only thing I have been wrong about in the last 20 years.”

“And also, Australia is fucked if there are four more senators from that party overlooking your entire political system”

Peter Dutton responds to the Nauru files: “I’m fucked”

TEXT:

THE NAURU FILES ARE the largest set of leaked documents published from inside Australia’s immigration detention system. They are a set of more than 2,000 incident reports from the Nauru detention centre, written by guards, caseworkers and teachers on the remote Pacific island.

They are extremely damning and detail the systematic violation of even the most basic human rights.

This morning, immigration minister Peter Dutton took the opportunity to respond to the leak.

“Well, it’s pretty bad,” he said.

“It looks like I’m fucked. Like prison fucked. But a lot of people forget that Scott Morrison was also the minister for immigration, but the kitchen got a bit too hot for him. At least I’m not a four-eyed doormat like that poon. I doubt he’ll get canned over any of this,”

“These’s whipping boys and then there’s me. Tony is going to be able to don his lycra and pedal himself around Sydney’s obscure northern forest, Scott will always be able to get blind at Northies and throw full cans of beer at immigrants sitting on Cronulla beach. Hockey can keep getting stoned in a park next to the Lincoln Memorial and nobody will care. I’m the only one getting fucked here.” he said.

The Advocate reached out to the Prime Minister’s office for comment, but only received a video of Malcolm Turnbull’s media advisor placing a middy in the urinal of a Manuka hotel. He then proceeded to fill it with urine as he quietly giggled to himself.

Local Leftie Hopes Waleed Aly Doesn’t Notice He’s Started Buying Coles Brand Milk Again

HE WAS SO MOVED BY WALEED ALY’S call to arms to buy name brand milk to support our dairy farmers, he even bought himself a Stetson.

However, as time marches on, local socialist Hayden Hatton has fallen back into his old habit of buying the cheapest possible product – and more often than not, it’s a generic store brand.

It’s not just milk. The 26-year-old coffee bean roaster also hopes that Aly doesn’t find out that he’s gone back to hating Sonia Kruger, even after Aly told him that she’s ‘not that evil’.

“Look, mate. I just don’t want to disappoint the big fella,” said Hatton.

“He’s a big role model of mine and I try to live a life that’s true to his philosophy. But it’s hard sometimes, you know? Waleed is such a brave character and the outspoken voice that this country needs to take it into the 21st century. I’d just hate myself if I disappointed him,”

“I’ve started buying Coles brand milk again because it’s just so fucking cheap. You simply cannot walk past it. I’m not made of money and the fine people at Coles know that. But, as we all know thanks to the farmer’s friend Waleed, Coles and Woolworths are robbing Australian farmers, fueling foreclosures and rural suicides from Bathurst to Bunbury. But the prices are down, down, down.”

When asked whether he’d consider following Aly into his next righteous crusade, Hayden Hatton said of course – with a few exceptions.

“If he goes after Pringles or Gatorade, I’m out. If he tells me to stop eating Tim Tams because the Chinese own it, or something like that, he can go get fucked. I’d rather give up my ability to reproduce than give up my junk food.”

George Christensen vows to protect every Australian’s right to mayonnaise

TEXT:

CONTROVERSIAL NORTHERN QUEENSLAND POLITICIAN George Christensen has kept his first election promise by ramping up his war on the powerful anti-mayonnaise lobby who will rest at nothing until the delicious thick, creamy dressing is removed from supermarket shelves.

Known throughout Queensland for its ability to turn any sandwich into a finger-licking good time, mayonnaise is often kept beside the corned beef and mango chutney in every fridge north of the Capricorn.

However, that basic human right was endangered prior to the election, which prompted the conservative heavyweight to declare war on those who hate the egg-based condiment.

The Advocate caught up with Christensen on the shoulder of a Mackay arterial road this afternoon.

“Every Queenslander has their favourite brand of mayonnaise,” he said, dabbing the sweat off his face and neck with a handkerchief.

“You have these Roma Street socialists who want to ban it, you have these perverts and sexual deviants wanting to remove it from supermarket shelves. What has Queensland become?”

“My local cafe makes a mayonnaise piccolo. I bring my brand of mayonnaise to Canberra with me because I can’t get it down there. It’s absolutely unacceptable. I will not stop fighting for the rights of mayonnaise producers and consumers.”

The 38-year-old’s penchant for the cheeky flavour enhancer is well known.

In 2011, he and his staff were stopped at the edge of the South Australian Agricultural Exclusion Zone while travelling overland between Melbourne and Adelaide.

Rather than surrender the 11 litres of “Aunty Gale’s Luxury Herb Mayonnaise” at the border, Christensen instructed his staff to join him in consuming every last gramme of it before they crossed into South Australia.

He was fined $456 for disturbing the peace and public indecency.

Guardian Reporters Trying Their Best Not To Acknowledge That Trump Is Going To Win This Thing

TEXT:

Following both the Republican and Democratic Conventions, as well as the recent DNC wikileaks emails, political reporters from The Guardian are now trying their very best to cover the US Presidential election without acknowledging the fact that Donald Trump is almost a sure bet to win this thing.

Speaking to the Betoota Advocate today, former Herald journalist and now full-time Guardian writer, Finn Leverson (55) says that he and his coworkers are making the most of living in an alternate universe while they can.

“To keep our sanity, most of our team are just going to pretend that it could go either way from this poin,” he says.

“Because deep down we know this thing is going to get very real, very soon,”

Established in Britain in 1821 in reaction to the closure of the radical workers’ newspaper Manchester Observer, the now predominantly online newspaper (theguardian.com) has two international web sites, Guardian Australia and Guardian US. The Guardian is influential well known for playing the role of a more ‘progressive’ news provider in English-language online news.

It is for this reason that their writers now feel like they are simply wasting air behind a keyboard, as they lay witness to the unstoppable rise of arguably the most uncouth, prejudicial and populist US Presidential candidate of all time.

“We really tried to get some alternative info out there” says Finn.

“But we were competing with a politicised, 24-hour branch of World Wrestling Entertainment,”

“It seems, much like Brexit, most voters just want to watch the world burn.”

Newly-hired, unpaid Guardian intern, Magnolia Smithers says she can’t believe the next President of America will be the man who’s campaign started with him falsely accusing Barack Obama of being an African-born Muslim sleeper cell.

“Even I think those conspiracies are a bit out there, and I’m an anti-vaxxer,”

“He’s been bankrupt five times and is on a podium talking about torturing people. It’s got to make you wonder”

“In my head, Bernie Sanders is still a nominee and Obama has another term…”

“I wouldn’t be able to do what I do if I didn’t lie to myself. Because when this thing actually happens, my office will be first cab off the rank for interment.”

Mike Baird Bans Blowjobs

TEXT:

Female-on-male and male-on-male oral sex will be banned in New South Wales from July 1 next year, with Premier Mike Baird saying the “widespread and systemic flagrance of sexual activity outside of wedlock” cannot be tolerated by the State Government and police force.

Mr Baird and his close friend, NSW Police Chief Scipione, have been outspoken opponents to both blow jobs and hand jobs for many years now. Baird says it comes down to their wholesome involvement in the Hillsong Church.

“You don’t need alcohol to have fun, our lock out laws have proven this. Plenty of young people have found other ways to spend their time.”

“The same goes for blowjobs. We do not need blowjobs to show love for one another… There are plenty of other ways. Like marriage, or buying a home together – these are things that we have had instilled into us by the church,”

It comes after a special commission of inquiry found overwhelming evidence of young people giving blowjobs as though they aren’t as intimate as “normal s.e.x”.

In announcing his reasons for the ban, Mr Baird said the inquiry found that young people were overlooking the sanctity of marriage by just “giving each other a bit of head” and says this kind of behaviour undermines any spiritual bond between two people.

“Marriage has worked out well for me, under the watchful eye of God,”

“I just hope that everyone else can experience that kind of sensibility… We don’t need blowjobs,”

This announcement comes not even six months after over 15,000 young people marched through Sydney’s CBD against the staff cuts, venue shutdowns, a lack of personal freedom and lost opportunities for young musicians that have resulted from the State Government’s lock-out laws on licensed venues across New South Wales – and one week after he announced a statewide ban on greyhound racing.

“There has been a 45% decrease in blowjobs since I first announced these trials,” he said.

“I won’t be moved on these numbers.

“I am cool, progressive and funny… I take no pleasure in announcing these bans,”

“But even I know that blowjobs are damaging the fabric of our society”

Mike Baird is yet to announce whether or not blowjobs will be allowed inside Star City hotel rooms, but has stated that he does not want to interfere with any upcoming reviews of these new bans.

Turnbull announces Fibre to the Home NBN will cause meme-related autism

TEXT:

IN STICKING WITH HIS plan for our future, prime minister Malcolm Turnbull has announced today that his Fibre to the Node dream for the National Broadband Network will go ahead, because bringing fibre into the home can cause autism.

Autism from memes.

Speaking today beside the communications minister, the PM outlined that there’s already been a dramatic spike in autism diagnosis that has been attributed to memes – and bringing lightning fast internet into the bedrooms of thousands of at-risk young men will only make things worse.

“You’ve got those two frogs,” said Turnbull.

“That one who always wants to kill himself and the one on the unicycle or swiss ball, I can’t remember. There’s others, but these are the ones that mainstream normies use every day now, which is making them much more susceptible to late-onset autism,”

“Young people should be out starting businesses and working hard. Going to college and having a go. If the Coalition were to give fibre internet to these meme makers and high-functioners, then we’re going to see some Brexit-level autism here in Australia – which is something I won’t let happen.”

Hitting back at the “damaging” and “hurtful” comments made by the prime minister earlier today, a local internet user, who’s high-functioning enough to speak to the barber when having a haircut, said that the PM is just showing how out of touch he is with younger voters.

Taking some time out from Pokemon Go! to speak to The Advocate this afternoon, Emmett “Lazerhawk” Coopers lashed out.

“Fibre to the Home is the smart option, but I guess Malcolm has always been a bit of a low-functioning prime minister,” said the 21-year-old marginally employed window washer.

“I’d be surprised if he’s even allowed to take a shit without first consulting the Christian right faction,”

“He’s not progressive at all. Gough Whitlam said we could even run the fibre cable through his corpse if we had to, just get it done. That’s progressive.”

Pauline Hanson’s Media Boycott Leaves Sunrise In Need Of A New Islam Expert

TEXT:

Last week the recently elected federal senator and leader of the far-right political party One Nation, Pauline Hanson, struck back at the patronising Australian media by posting a video on Facebook, now viewed more than 370,000 times, in which she told her supporters she was putting the news outlets on notice.

I wouldn’t mind a working relationship with you. But if you’re not going to give me a fair go, don’t come knocking on my door, because you ain’t going to get an interview out of me. 

The controversial anti-multiculturalist’s declaration of a media boycott proves to be hardly an issue for her voters, as most of them don’t ‘trust’ mainstream media anyway – opting to get their ‘news’ from grainy jpeg images created by right-wing extremists on Aussie Pride Facebook pages.

However, the senator’s announcement appears to be quite an issue for breakfast news outlets, particularly Channel 7’s Sunrise, who have worked very hard to maintain a strong bond with Pauline Hanson over the years – only to lose access the moment she became popular enough to be voted into the Australian senate.

Whether it was Dancing with The Stars, or her regular appearances on Seven’s Sunrise – ABC’s Media Watch have counted 20 appearances for Pauline Hanson on Channel 7 since September, of which she was paid for each.

Speaking to The Betoota Advocate today, Sunrise host and the goofy uncle of Australia’s jaded underclass, David Koch says the Seven Network have unintentionally shot themselves in the foot by giving Pauline Hanson enough airtime to become a real political force.

“We’ve essentially just gifted our most lucrative dial-a-grab to the Federal Senate for the next six years” he said.

“We are going to be hard pressed to find another ‘Islam expert’ that can bring about as much online discussion as Pauline Hanson does when she berates a international community of 1.5 billion people on our breakfast show”.

“We really look forward to having her back on. She really resonates with our audience demographic,”

“Not many other people are able to draw parallels between Islam and the fact that Kev from Geelong has a problem with the grog. She’s the only one speaking for these people,”

When asked if he was concerned that Pauline Hanson might be a bit uninformed, following revelations that the One Nation Party has copied slabs of text from the internet for some of its policies — including from Wikipedia, David Koch says no.

“Look, we are always going to be hard pressed to find many Australians who are actually an authority of Islam, or multiculturalism in general,”

“The only social commentator that comes to mind is Waleed Aly, but he is too far too vague. Our audience wants to be told who to blame for the fact that they can’t find work and that their children are growing up in a violent household.”

In what is surely to become nothing more than a headline, it was reported today that chunks of Senator Hanson’s policies on halal certification, sustainable development and medicinal cannabis have been copied directly from the internet.

These revelations will do nothing to change the fact that Pauline Hanson has already been voted into the senate.

During her pre-election campaign, which was heavily aided by paid media appearances on Channel Seven, Ms Hanson called for a ban on Muslim immigration to Australia, a royal commission into Islam and a ban on new mosques.

Local voter, Tahleighah (32) from Bendigo agrees with everything Pauline Hanson says.

“I didn’t know who she was until I seen her Sunrise,” she says.

“But she makes sense, aye. Especially when it comes to the Mosques,”

Tahleighah says that One Nation is the only political party that preaches common sense policies when it comes to creating an inclusive society where people from other backgrounds are able to build their own places of worship, just like the hundreds religions currently operating in Australia are able to do so

“Ban the mosques I say, building a mosque in Bendigo will only ruin our already crystal-meth-ravaged town.”

Local Underachiever Can’t Blame Anyone For His Life After 7 Days Of No Government

TEXT:

Local underachiever, Ben Inglis, no longer has anyone to blame for his lack of life savings, job security, sobriety and education – it has been confirmed.

The 31-year-old freelance sign-writer has for a long time been able to justify his lack of life stability with topical but obscure political jargon related to whichever particular political party held power at a federal level – but for the last seven days, Australia’s lack of government is leaving him with no one to blame but himself.

While Ben’s parents have for many years insisted that his uninspiring life is purely due to a lack of enthusiasm – he insists that that they wouldn’t understand because they aren’t keeping an eye on what “these idiots are doing”.

In 2008, he was able to blame his lack of employment on Kevin’s Rudd $900 stimulus package.

“What a joke,” he said.

“There’s so many industries, like mine, in need of Government support and they are just giving nine hundred bucks for people to spend on nothing!”

Under Gillard he blamed the carbon tax for keeping him out of work.

“Mate, what the fuck’s going on? My industry is being crippled by this rubbish!” he said.

“It’s like she doesn’t want to see progress. I’m not getting any work in the near future as long as this tax is around… It’s anti-growth!”

Despite being out of full time work the entire time, Ben was also able to blame both the Abbott and Turnbull Prime Ministerships on his inability to own a car in his early thirties.

“This negative gearing is fucked. Have you read about?” he said, without giving too much away.

“My parent’s generation will never understand. Rent is through the roof, I’ve gotta pay my phone bill tomorrow – and all they care about is looking after the baby boomers.”

However, after absolutely no government for the last seven days, Mr Inglis is now being forced to take a long hard look at himself.

“I don’t know, man. I really buggered around in my twenties,”

“Maybe I should have married [ex-girlfriend of 12 years]”

“It’s my fault really, I should have seen the writing on the wall”

However, with the state Government’s extreme new measures put in place to curb anti-social drinking, Ben still has a few cards left to play.”

“What am I going to do? Get a job in a pub? Not likely,”

“Thanks a lot Nannastacia!”

Wyatt Roy Returns To Previous Position Drinking Tallies Outside Caboolture Train Station

TEXT:

While Liberal MP Wyatt Roy appears to have lost out to his ALP opponent, Susan Lamb for the Longman electorate north of Brisbane, the 26-year-old is still holding out while more results from the weekend’s election are being voted.

In the meanwhile, the born and bred Caboolture boy has returned to his previous post, drinking longnecks [tallies] of XXXX Bitter out front of the local train station.

“Yeah, it probably does feel a bit weird back here on the spot after half a decade in Parliament,” he told reporters this afternoon.

“But this is where I feel most at home, and if by some chance the postal votes don’t end up in my favour, this is where I’ll stay,”

Our interview was briefly interrupted by Mr Roy’s close mate, ‘Slinger’ who arrived shirtless to ‘the spot’ after making a bottle-o run.

“Do you know these cunts, WyRoy?” he asked the Liberal MP, before focusing his attention to our editor Errol Parker.

“You wanna dip, bra?”

“What’s your fuckin’ go?”

The subsequent scuffle between ‘Slinger’ and our journalists was broken up by the Member For Longman, who managed to separate the melee while insisting “They’re with me, bra” in a thick Caboolture accent.

“Fucking fall back Slinger ya dopey cunt,” he continued, opting to disregard his previous Queen’s English.

“Last thing you need is another stint, fuck ya,”

On Sunday it was revealed by The Betoota Advocate that Wyatt Roy had locked himself in his bedroom to contemplate life while listening to Coldplay. Faced with having to re-enter society as a normal working human, the career politician was at a loss at what he was going to do with himself.

However, it now seems that after less than a week home in the ‘Boo, Wyatt Roy has well and truly slotted back into the life he lived before he was surprisingly voted into the House Of Representatives.

“How many cunts make it out Caboolture and can still come back and still move shard when they feel like it?” says Slinger before smoking a roll-your-own cigarette with three fingers held close to his face.

“Fuck all do. Let alone former Members of Cabinet.”

Wyatt Roy laughs.

“From the Cab’ straight back to the lab” he says.

Both men laugh and Slinger tells Wyatt he’s a mad cunt, before handing each of us a tallie.

CHILCOT: John Howard uses the Harriet Wran defence – “I was there, but I didn’t kill anyone”

TEXT:

GEORGE W. BUSH AND TONY BLAIR were the ones who wanted to topple the Saddam Hussien regime, John Howard just happened to be there at the time.

That’s the message from Gen Y’s most beloved former prime minister today, as he defended his involved in the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

John Howard has spent his been under the public spotlight in the wake of this year’s election, but now he feels that he needs to retreat back into the shadows once again.

“I, like Ms Wran, were party to an incredibly diffuclt decision,” said Howard.

“I ended up making the most difficult decision of my policial life, one that’s still with me all these years later. A keen-eared political junkie would’ve picked up that I said the same thing regarding my firearms reform in the wake of Orlando, but we’re passed that now,”

“But yeah. Bush and Blair pretty much got in my ear about Saddam, then we all agreed to go ham on him. But they did most of the etch shit, like blow up civillian targets and execute his entire family. We didn’t skirt the law as much.”

The 76-year-old’s honesty is refreshing to many Australians who lived and died in the turbulent post Y2K world, who fondly remember Howard as the nation’s father figure – Kim Beazley with a smaller, but smarter heart.

Cory Bernardi discovered playing as transgender werewolf in Second Life

TEXT:

RIPPLES OF IMMORALITY ARE making their way through the Liberal Party this morning as controversial senator Cory Bernardi has been discovered playing the widely popular MMORPG, Second Life, as a transgender werewolf.

Since 2012, the 46-year-old has been interacting with other users of the perverted video game as “Akiriana”, a non-binary-yet-transgender-third-generation werewolf from the realm of Koozoo.

Historically, the MMORPG [Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game] has long since been seen as an escape for people battling with their own identities and desires – most notably, those with strong religious beliefs and shackled sexual urges.

The prime minister has broken his silence over the controversy, saying that while he doesn’t understand what the hell is going on, he agrees that no laws have been broken.

“Look, I’ll be talking to him privately about this, but from what I understand is that it’s some pretty sick shit,” said Malcolm Turnbull.

“However, the’s completely free to live life as a purple trans-pangender walking dog on the internet if he wants to – it’s none of my business,”

“But yeah mate, it’s pretty crook but.”

Albo Secretly Wants Turnbull To Win By A Landslide

TEXT:

Despite being a high-ranking ALP ‘executioner’ – Former Deputy Prime Minister and the Member For Grayndler, Anthony Albanese MP is secretly hoping that this current election will result in a majority LNP Government, it has been confirmed.

After getting a taste of the power as Rudd’s Deputy, ‘Albo’ was initially hoping that Prime Minister Turnbull was able to win the 2016 federal election by a landslide, in turn exposing the current leader of the opposition Bill Shorten to be an incompetent candidate for the Prime Ministership of an ALP Government.

This kind of result would have surely seen Mr Albanese promoted to the Leader of the Opposition.

Speaking to The Betoota Advocate before the election, Albo said he had the utmost confidence that he would make the greatest Labor Prime Minister our country had ever seen.

“I’d be a combination of Hawkey’s aggression with Keating’s wit. Gillard’s sensitivities rolled in with Rudd’s sociopathic disregard for anyone but myself. I would lead this country in and out of wars with style and panache!” said the former houso kid from Sydney’s Inner-West

“My mother raised well so I am great with the grey army… They’d love me as their leader… Most of them don’t even know I’m Italian,”

“And I’ve still got enough of the hood in me to understand what it’s like on the street,”

“I am the quintessential everyman. Glory Glory to South Sydney”

90% of Millennials would rather have Tony Abbott back than be forced to vote again

TEXT:

5 July, 18:01

ONE OF THE POSSIBLE OUTCOMES of this year’s election is that we might be heading back to the polls sooner than we think.

Australians are facing the prospect of having to cast two federal votes this year after last weekend’s result has done nothing except make the whole situation worse.

However, news that this might end up being the case has been met with backlash from the nation’s youngest voters, who’d rather have former PM Tony Abbott back in the cockpit than give up another Saturday afternoon so soon.

From Bundaberg to Bunbury, Millenial voters agree that “he wasn’t actually that bad” compared to what they’re witnessing right now.

Sam Gregson said he missed out on pre-drinks before a mate’s birthday over the weekend, simply because he was “forced to go and choose between two of the most uninspiring human beings this country has ever produced at an election.”

“Look, I’d rather have Abbott back then vote again. The whole experience was horrible,” said the Perth arts student.

“People my age have things to do on the weekend. We have lives,”

“If these chinless baby boomers can’t work something out then fuck the lot of them off, put Tony back in. At least he wasn’t afraid to put people in their box and speak his mind. I’m sick of it. Why do we pay these communists and pig bankers so much money to just jerk us off like this? Are you fucking kidding me, but? If they ask me to vote again, they’ve got another thing coming,” said the cranky 24-year-old.

Counting has resumed, with an election result due sometime before Wyatt Roy dies of old age.

SA Election: Confident Nick Xenophon Caught On CCTV Already Blowing Up Pokie Machines

TEXT:

Former Senator Nick Xenophon has today been filmed smashing up several pokie machines in an Adelaide hotel, after reading recent poll data that shows him as the number one favourite to take out the South Australian election.

Despite the fact that he had previously been in the Australian Senate for nine years and won a record vote of 24.9 per cent in South Australia at the 2013 Federal Election, it is believed that Senator Nick Xenophon has now secured enough support stated-wide to begin implementing his lifelong plan to rid South Australia of pokie machines.

The Independent from South Australia and the leader of the Nick Xenophon Team has for a long time claimed that he just wants to tackle the issues facing everyday South Australians, and after building on a successfully career in politics off the back of a strong anti-gambling platform – it appears the ‘Hilltop Hood’ has pulled the trigger on his ultimate dream of blatantly smashing pokie machines in plain sight.

“This is what it was all about,” Mr Xenophon told media while loitering out front of another RSL before it opened at 07:30 am this morning.

“I’ve waited three decades for this. I am the King of South Australia”

“My party is also expected to win by landslide. I’m not saying that I am God… but I am saying that I would make a very powerful enemy.

“The moment this RSL opens up I’m going to be bussin’ some glass inside,” he said before breaking in a stirring accapella rendition of The Whitlam’s 1999 classic ‘Blow Up The Pokies’.

While police and political opponents debate whether or not Mr Xenophon’s new ‘smash-a-slot’ program is legal – many of his supporters around the country have followed suit.

“I’ve been wantin’ to do this for twenty fuckin’ years” said local Happy Valley resident, Bryan Quirk.

“These fuckin’ things have taken everything from me. I’m glad there is finally a politician who supports smashing the fuck outta ’em”

RETREATING TO HIS PARENTS HOME on Queensland’s methamphetamine coast, former MP Wyatt Roy has locked himself in his bedroom to contemplate life while listening to Coldplay.

Faced with having to re-enter society as a normal working human being, Roy says he’s not quite ready.

“What the hell am I supposed to do now? I thought I was going to be the next Chris Pyne! Now I have to buy a fucking pill press or something,”

“Three types of people in Longman own Porches. Doctors, lawyers and people who own a pill press. I’m cooked now, I’ll have to move to Brisbane.”

Greens campaigner regrets wearing Birkenstocks on such a cold day

TEXT:

AS THE SUN SETS ON another ordinary election day, one young Melbourne greens campaigner is facing the prospect of having to catch the tram home in Birkenstocks.

Only problem is it’s very cold.

Kate Lewis said she had a bit of a brain snap when she pulled on her German riding boots this morning as she headed out the door to campaign.

She spoke to The Advocate this afternoon via SMS.

“It gets worse,” she said.

“When I finally to the polling station at Dandenong Primary, this pig rolled up in a Hilux blaring Brown Sugar by the Rolling Stones at full volume. Doesn’t he know it’s about raping a black girl? What a fucking joke. That got me so angry,”

“Then he had the gall to wink at me as he shared a man nod with the Liberals campaigner. I had to clench my fists and breath.”

But that’s not all.

After long day of breaking people’s personal space and calling old white men ‘dickbags’, Kate felt a droplet of spit hit her lips and a Liberal voter sneezed.

That was it for the 23-year-old politically minded theology student. She’d had enough.

“I keyed a BMW and walked home. My feet are freezing. I’m going to get the cat to sit on them when I get home.”

Joe Hockey officially endorses Malcolm Turnbull with touching tweet

TEXT:

IF YOU THINK THERE’S ANY bad blood inside the Liberal Party, think again.

After months of radio silence, Abbott Treasurer Joe Hockey has come in from the cold on the last day of campaigning and officially thrown his support behind Malcolm Turnbull.

Tensions between Hockey and Turnbull have thawed recently as the North Sydneysider was given the honour of becoming the next ambassador to the United States – a role that’s traditionally given to a politician who should’ve been a prime minister.

Speaking today from the US capital, Hockey said he’s come to like the prime minister lately.

“I was a bit off the cuntbag to begin with,” said Hockey.

“Tony was going to get whipped at the next election, then it was going to be my turn to be captain-coach. Then this grey-haired banker comes swanning in and fucks everything up for me,”

“But that’s all in the past now. Fuck it. Cuntbag isn’t that bad, I guess. I’d rather have a bloke who knows his way around chequebook than some union stooge who got his media training at NIDA. Listening to Shorten speak is like being waterboarded with McDonald’s soft serve.”

As the prime minister is refusing to address any questions from the media today, The Advocate wasn’t able to receive any comment on the political olive branch.

However, he did return fire.

Abbott Says Turnbull Should Be Focusing On Bizarre Religious Issues That Only Concern Old People

TEXT:

Former Prime Minister Tony Abbott has criticised his successor’s election campaign, saying the focus has strayed in the final days because Malcolm Turnbull hasn’t focused on the “big issues” ahead of the 2017 budget.

Abbott believes Turnbull is too caught up in political populism to address the issues currently faced by old people in Sydney’s Upper North Shore who don’t believe in Climate Change

Mr Abbott told 2GB this morning that it had been an election campaign “where a lot of big issues have been touched on without really being developed”.

“Malcolm has not been saying ‘boats’ enough. It’s almost like he wants it to be a close race,” he said.

“Intense and alarmist discussions of border security give voters that little prejudicial kick they need to bring it home,

Mr Abbott, who has never really worked outside of Canberra, says his relationship with Australia’s upper-middle class is something that Malcolm Turnbull should look to emulating in this last week of the election.

“Whats with all this gay shit? He’s acting like the party would actually allow gays to get married?”

“I was able to condemn marriage equality, get elected, and have a gay sister at the same time. This bloke doesn’t understand Australia’s jaded aspirational class… I would have won the last election, hands down,”

“Peta was really good at getting me on the front of the telegraph – Malcolm won’t even go on 2GB,”

Turnbull Staffer Sacked After Forgetting To Pack Hand Sanitiser For Carindale Pub Visit

TEXT:

A 24-year-old LNP staffer has been stood down today after recklessly forgetting to pack hand sanitiser during the Prime Minister’s visit to the middle-to-low-socio-economic suburbs of Eastern Brisbane.

It is believed that, after touching the hands of hundreds of agreeable voters, Malcolm Turnbull was sent into a uncontrollable rage when the young staffer, Alf Luent (Bellevue Hill), informed the Prime Minister that he had forgotten to pack a bottle of Dettol Healthy Touch Moisturising Hand Sanitiser.

Mr Luen was told to head back to the Wentworth electoral office by plane, and forced to hand over his woollen gloves, so as to prevent the Prime Minister from contracting anymore germs from the blue-collar voters in Carindale.

“Not good enough, Alf.” Mr Turnbull told the former Secretary of the Young Liberals NSW.

“Head back to the office, put your stuff in a box, and head home. I don’t want to see you until Saturday night,”

“I’m out here touching the hands of forklift drivers and you tell me you’ve forgotten the alco-rub? You’re fucking lucky we didn’t have to go to a place of worship on this trip!?”

“Get back on the nod-off express. I’m so off you,”

This isn’t the first time Malcolm Turnbull’s mysophobia has resulted in tensions within the party. In July 2014, the then Minister For Communication found himself light-headed when he noticed Joe Hockey turning sausages with his fingers, during a colleague barbeque at the former-Treasurer’s Hunters Hill home.

In 2009 Turnbull took great offence to his then cheif-of-staff, Peta Credlin picking her toenails while sitting at his Canberra desk. She was then demoted to a deputy position she was demoted to deputy during this tenure.

Tony Abbott compares rival James Mathison to a pug in vitriolic campaign memes

TEXT:

IN THE LEAD UP TO THIS election, former prime minister Tony Abbott hired somebody under 35 who suggested he reconnect with young voters in his electorate through the meme medium.

The first target in his crosshairs is challenger James Mathison, who he sees as a threat to his reelection because young people love him.

In a venomous and dank attack, the 38-year-old Capricorn was compared to a pug dog by Tony Abbott’s campaign in an Instagram post that has since punched through the critical 11 like barrier.

Abbott’s social media director Alex Craigend, was hand-picked by the 58-year-old because of his youth and connection to the pop-culture undercurrent. Prior to taking the job with the politician, Craigend was a copywriter with a shit haircut with a God complex.

The 34-year-old meme maker is Tony Abbott’s secret weapon in taking down the ying to Osher Günsberg’s yang.

“The best way to connect with young people these days is to reach them through their phones,” said Craigend.

“And young people look at memes on their phone. You need to find a happy medium between those seriously on-the-spectrum dank memes and the lame memegenerator.com ones,”

“James Mathison isn’t using memes because he’s actually a closeted square who hates going out. He’s taken this pro-anti-lockout stance but he’s lying, he hates going out. Come Saturday night, you’d most likely find him in his ugg boots at home playing FIFA.”

The Advocate approached Mathison for comment, but his campaign manager said he had a big one with weatherman Tim Bailey last night and was keying cars in Davidson.

“Just young people things.” said his campaign manager.

VIDEO: Australia’s Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce Filmed Smoking Marijuana?

TEXT:

Australia’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister For Agriculture Barnaby Joyce has been caught on video apparently smoking marijuana while on the campaign trail in New England last night.

It is believed that while visiting a bowls club in northe-west NSW town of Guyra, the Deputy Prime Minister got a bit carried away during the State Of Origin broadcast.

It is alleged that Barnaby Joyce was then invited to go outside ‘for a smoke’ with younger patrons, oblivious to the fact that they were talking about illicit substances.

After some stern mob mentality, it has been suggested Mr Joyce agreed to take a hit from the “Ice Break Saxophone” – a street term for a homemade bong, used to smoke marijuana.

SEE VIDEO BELOW:

Local punter, Teddy Daniels (19) says Barnaby pulled the cone like a champ.

“We packed that thing up to the very fucking top. Jesus he’s got some lungs on him,” says the aspiring Aussie hip hop artist.

“But he wouldn’t stop banging on about jobs and growth…”

“We had to tell him, mate were aren’t going to vote on slogans or policies… Its just about whoever is the funniest bloke on the day, or whoever we see in the news the most,”

“I’ll you what, Barnaby has got my vote after that. I’ll vote for any man who is humble enough to punch rompers in the Guyra Bowlo car park with a bunch of unemployed teenagers. He’s a mad c**t.”

While witnesses are yet to clarify if it was actually marijuana being smoked through the bong, Mr Joyce has said his involvement in the ‘car park sesh’ was very much part of the job.

“Hey, I’m the Minister for Agriculture. I gotta keep an eye on the new crops [laughter].” said the Deputy Prime Minister

Turnbull Hires Former ZOO Magazine Writers To Help Secure Tradie Voters

TEXT:

Not even 12 hours since its release, Malcolm Turnbull’s new campaign ad is under fire for featuring a ‘tradesman’ speaking in Queen’s English.

The new campaign, which showcases a NIDA-trained thespian pretending to be a blue-collar ‘battler’ has been gone viral today under the hashtag #FakeTradie.

Speaking to The Betoota Advocate this morning, Turnbull says he wasn’t 100% convinced the advertisement would appeal to the Australia aspirational class, and that he has since sacked the media staffers responsible for the campaign video.

“There’s a lot of different people I need to appeal to as Prime Minister. I already have the banking sector sorted, but it’s the droves of jilted middle class Australians that I really need to target,”

“My predecessor had a much better time talking to these people, all he had to do was create a sentiment of Hanson-era xenophobia. I’ve made a point of not saying ‘boats’ as much in this election,”

“But yes, I am still struggling with this messaging as you can imagine. The people behind this video have been let go,”

Turnbull says he has searched far and wide for the right voice when it comes to appealing to non-private school educated people who work with their hands.

“I even went down to the Sydney Roosters HQ in Bondi. Unfortunately Bouris says he’s having the same problem. We’ve all forgotten how to talk to these people. They are a fascinating sub-culture,”

“After speaking with several of my National Party colleagues, I resolved to hire a handful of ex-ZOO magazine staffers. They seemed to have this market sorted out,”

“Barnaby got me hooked on the filth years ago. During that whole Depp saga, he came in with a ZOO and said ‘get a load of the norcs on this one’ as he showed me a suggestive centrefold of Amber Heard,”

The iconic lads mag, Zoo Weekly, officially announced it’s closure on the 17th September 2015 . The closure encompassed all platforms: print, website and social media assets and took effect from Monday 12 October 2015 – after the publication was criticised for increasingly insensitive content. Including a feature article on “the list of Australia’s sexiest Asylum Seekers”.

Prior to their closure, Turnbull says his staffers had often briefed him on each weekly release, prior to dealing with middle class people.

“My media advisor quizzed me on pub ammo each time I put on my high-vis vest. But now that the magazine is no longer in circulation, I’ve had to actually hire these writers myself.

The Turnbull campaign is now expected to feature far more voyeuristic imagery and hilarious sporting accidents – but will it be enough.

Malcolm says he hopes so.

“Hopefully we can get an actual tradesmen to endorse us. I’ll have to have a chat to Lucy, I think someone’s coming over this afternoon to fix gates.”

Bill Shorten Reportedly Seen Playing ‘Panda’ While Dutching Up ALP Range Rover

TEXT:

Opposition leader, Bill Shorten has been spotted celebrating his unexpected win over Prime Minister Bill Shorten during Friday night’s leaders debate.

AAP cameras spotted the the 49-year-old politician blaring the popular trap record “Panda” by Brooklyn rapper Desiigner in his ALP campaign Range Rover yesterday afternoon while driving through Sydney.

A witness describes the atmosphere as something like a Logan City warehouse party.

“I don’t know if it was a vape, or a blunt… But something was burning in that car and it smelt loud” says Sydney council worker Craig Tolosa.

“Deadset he looked like one of my cousins that deal coke. He must be feeling like a real G after that weird facebook thing last night.”

More than 2.2 million people have watched the news.com.au and Facebook Leaders’ Debate in their Facebook newsfeed on Friday, according to the latest figures, but that number is expected to climb as people catch up over the weekend.

Voters expressed their response to what the leaders were saying with 13,000 Facebook reactions, including 9200 likes and 2100 “angry” faces.

Those in the live audience judged Mr Shorten the winner, by 17 to 7.

It would appear Mr Shorten is now playing on his underdog story, by cruising through his opponents city blaring explicit rap music that includes the lyrics:

I got broads in Atlanta
Twisting dope, lean, and the Fanta
Credit cards in the scanners
Hitting off licks in the bando
Black X6, Phantom
White X6, look like a panda
Going out like I’m Montana
Hundred killers, hundred hammers

Speaking to the Betoota Advocate today, Bill Shorten MP says his choice of music was in no way a shot at Malcolm Turnbull, stating that he has been a long time fan of Desiigner’s music since he first heard him as a feature artist on Kanye West’s The Life Of Pablo.

“It actually speaks to me as a song. I have for many years enjoyed mixing codeine cough syrup with my fanta. As for credit cards in the scanners… well I often talk about the ALP spend-o-metre [laughter].

In 2015, Mr Shorten was accused of bullying within the Labor Party after he berated Penny Wong for ‘bum-puffing’ a cigar-paper-blunt at a Union function in Bendigo. The Victorian MP is often described as “Blaze Shorten” – a reference to his love of high-quality herbal aromatherapy.

While refusing to state whether or not he was in fact smoking marijuana while driving through Sydney city yesterday afternoon, Mr Shorten has acknowledged that playing gangster music and ‘dutching up’ is his preferred way of unwinding after a tense political debate.

“This campaign is exhausting. I just needed to get faded,” he said.

“Friday night got so turnt after I ate that motherfucker up. The facebook debate needs a 420 emoji [laughter]”

Labor To Address Children On Nauru The Moment They Sort Out Cattle In Vietnam

TEXT:

The Australian Labor Party has today declared they will ‘get around’ to ‘discussing’ viable alternatives to the detainment of war-weary asylum seeker children on Nauru, the moment they sort out this issue with those couple of cows in Vietnam.

Labor has called for an independent office for animal welfare after video footage emerged of what appears to be recently-exported Australian cattle being bludgeoned to death with sledgehammers in Vietnamese abattoirs.

The isolated incident in Vietnam looks to be something that will be acted on immediately, and takes complete priority over the fact that the mental health of detained refugees continues to deteriorate in the sweltering hot pacific Island jail of Nauru Detention centre.

Speaking to the Today Show today, Labor MP Anthony Albanese declared that “Australians want to know that their government is going to act on Animal cruelty in a irrational and rushed fashion that results in the crushing of an entire Agricultural sector – just like we did last time”.

“We’ll address the other stuff after”

In June 2011, the ALP Gillard Government implemented a live cattle export ban for two months and had stringent new guidelines introduced as a response to a television program which showed footage of mis-treatment of Australian sourced cattle at certain Indonesian abattoirs.

In that time, Northern Australia suffered significant loss of earnings and the 2012 Federal Budget confirmed that a potential class action had been communicated to the government from livestock producers and related industries, who’s entire livelihoods had been ruined due to the actions of several uneducated meat processing workers in south-east Asia.

At the same time they were battling cruelty in foreign abattoirs, the Gillard Labor Government made it clear that cruelty towards non-Australian lives were not as big of an issue, even if they were human lives.

In 2012, Prime Minister Gillard announced the reopening Nauru detention centre and Manus Island detention centre for offshore processing of young asylum seeker families who had travelled months at sea in a leaky boat to avoid being murdered by horrifying regimes elsewhere in the world.

On 19 July 2013, newly returned Prime Minister Kevin Rudd announced, “asylum seekers who come here by boat without a visa will never be settled in Australia” – striking a Regional Resettlement Arrangement between Australia and Papua New Guinea – an agreement that Papua New Guinea now detests and has been found to be a violation of international law.

Nauru detention centre detainee, Azim*, spoke to the Betoota Advocate today, via smoke signals he had created with left over flammables that had been used for self-immolation protests last month.

“If only I was a cow” he said.

“That might sound like I am losing my mind, which I am, but I just know if a foreign abattoir had the same amount of rapes and suicides, there would definitely be a bipartisan Government intervention within days,”

“Unfortunately I am a human export, and that’s not something Australian politicians care about. The four Prime Ministers I have seen since I arrived here have been quite indifferent to my plight.”

“I wish all the best for the cows.”

Ginger-Headed Woman In Bright Red Blazer Criticises Minorities For Not Blending In

TEXT:

A ginger-headed woman dressed in a black skivvy and bright red blazer has today criticised our migrant population for not immediately assimilating into Australian society.

Speaking to her nephew’s iPhone camera today, The softly spoken megaphone of Australian racism, Pauline Hanson, has come to the defence of the thousands of other Australian’s who dress like they are playing background extras in the widely panned 1982 American musical romantic comedy film, Grease 2.

“We need to protect Australian culture from a 1.6 billion-strong diaspora of thousands of different nationalities and religious sects,” said Ms Hanson, leader of the far-right anti-multiculturalist political party, One Nation.

“These people do not assimilate to everyday Australia,”

Throughout her two and a half minute tirade of vitriolic and racist stereotyping, the former fish and chip store owner from Ipswich spoke out against her newest enemy. A culture that she says spruiks racist and vitriolic sentiments towards people who enjoy wearing skivvys and blazers.

“We need to look after our own backyard first” she said in her timid, grandmotherly voice that many people have described as the “Australian Siri”.

“I will fight for the Australian way of life! Enough is enough” she finished the video with, before adjusting her gold and ruby coloured broach.

The video was well received by the fear-driven grandparents and at-risk youths who ‘liked’ it on Facebook.

“Look After Our Own Backyard First” Says Man With Burnt Out Commodore In Own Backyard

TEXT:

Local man, Byron Strut (36) says Australia needs to focus on finding homes for the droves of homeless people on our streets before accepting refugees and asylum seekers.

Despite the fact that Mr Strut has not once mowed the entire lawn of his two-acre property in Brisbane’s Northern Suburbs, he says Australia needs to stop focusing on overcrowding NSW suburbs in Western Sydney with new citizens from abroad.

Speaking to the Betoota Advocate today in front of a burnt out Commodore in his backyard, the full time crane operator says he’s just about “had it” with the way Australia puts the war-weary and stateless before the weather-weary and homeless “in our own backyard”.

“We need to look after our own first,”

“There’s a lot going on in our own backyard that needs addressing before we even think about resettling twelve thousand persecuted victims of war crimes in Australia,”

“Number one, homelessness,”

“Number two, old people”

Mr Strut struggled to identify what it was exactly that he wanted our nation’s leaders to do for “old people” but he did outline that he often thinks about our nation’s homeless during the winter months, or whenever he sees camera footage of destitute Middle Eastern refugees on television.

“We’ve got people who don’t even have homes, and you want to bring in this mob from overseas who don’t even speak the language to take all the jobs?”

“Not on my watch. I’d much prefer a homeless person making my meals than one of those people,”

“Or teaching my children,”

“Or working on my car”

Mr Strut then stubs out a Winfield Red cigarette on front  of the rusted and decrepit Holden Commodore that has sat in his backyard since 2013.

“We don’t want that mess here mate,”

“We’ve got enough stuff to sort out before letting people in.”

Barnaby Joyce’s election campaign once again derailed by publicity

TEXT:

THE DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER is back in the headlines again today after he told some mouthy hornbag down at a New England pub to “piss off” when a quiet discussion about mining got out of hand.

Coming in on the burst, Joyce featured alongside political and personal rival Tony Windsor on ABC’s Q&A programme on Monday night, which was broadcast live from a hall in Tamworth.

Prior to the event, the two blokes battling it out for the seat got in a heated scuffle just before the broadcast went live.

However, Joyce’s election campaign was first derailed during the Johnny Depp saga – a never ending trans-national stand off of egos that first started when the Hollywood star had the hide to sneak his “fucking dogs” into the country, according to Mr Joyce.

Since then, there has yet to be a week go by without the mainstream media belittling and undermining the 49-year-old’s campaign by providing him with a platform to speak from and publicity to bathe in.

We spoke to the Nationals leader this afternoon via telephone.

“Look, mate. All this publicity I’ve been getting over the last few months has really bailed me up,” said Joyce.

“I don’t know what I’ll do if these big city fat cats keep painting me in such a way that makes me unappealing to city voters,”

“If the city people don’t like me for acting like a happy-go-lucky country lout, I’m buggered.”

This is what Mr Joyce had to say about an earlier, but unrelated, incident involving a pub, sugarcane champagne and altercations.

Local Dad still pretending not to care about son’s earrings, man bun

TEXT:

AFTER COMING FROM HUMBLE BEGINNINGS, one senior partner at a prestigious Sydney law firm promised his young self that he’d support his children and give them every leg up in life that he never had.

That was until his 20-year-old son Matthew came home one afternoon with a series of exotic ear piercings and his long brown hair tied back with one of his daughter’s elastics.

“When he came down the stairs that morning, with those fucking earrings and his hair tied back like a girl, I just had to bite my tongue and nod and smile,” said 58-year-old Grosvenor Beaumont, a corporate law expert.

I met with Mr Beaumont at his trophy home in Sydney’s Bellevue Hill consulate district.

“I thought I was a good parent, but that morning, I knew I’d screwed up somewhere along the line. That afternoon, I had my first cigarette in ten years. I stole one out of my son’s sock drawer. Walked down to the pool house and lay down on a sunchair and looked up at the sky,”

“But if you ask me when my wife is around, or anybody else for that matter, I’ll say that I don’t really care. Deep down, it’s killing me.”

Grosvenor has found himself smoking more and more in recent months, as he comes to terms with his son’s man bun and earrings.

Saying that he can do what he wants now because he’s nearly 60 and owns an eight-million-dollar home in Sydney’s east outright, Grosvenor explained to The Advocate that he’ll give up smoking again when Matthew either gives up being such a milky cunt, or moves out to be with his people in the inner west.

“At least three mornings a week, I think about driving my car into a wall or burning my house down,” he said.

“Can you get done for  arson for burning down your owning house? I’m not sure. It’s not my area of law. I’ll have to make a few calls when I get to work,”

“Have you seen American Beauty?  That’s what my life’s like, except without all the boy on boy kissing and hot cheerleaders trying to get all up in my business,”

“Idyllic.”

Petition Demands TODAY’s Charles Croucher Wear A Piano Key Necktie During Live Cross

TEXT:

Channel Nine’s political reporter Charles Croucher is well known throughout Australia’s media landscape as ‘the first on the scene’ in regards to breaking #auspol news.

He was the first Australian journalist to tweet about the #libspill and also the first Betoota Advocate old boy to ever be allowed inside Parliament house.

However, what many people don’t know about “Television’s Mr Nice Guy” and our newspaper’s favourite ex-intern, is his sense of style and jovial disposition, something that has been communicated by the journalist’s die-hard supporters in the shape of a Change.org petition. (SEE BELOW).

In less than 12 hours, the petition, titled: TODAY’s Charles Croucher To Wear A Piano Key Necktie During Live Cross From Parliament – has garnered nearly 1000 signatures.

“Help us petition against Channel Nine’s Canberra correspondent and political news reporter, Charles Croucher’s blatant refusal to wear a piano key necktie during a live cross to the TODAY show.

Mr Croucher is well known in media and regional club rugby circles as a man of panache, style and charisma – it is a downright shame that he feels unable to express his true sense of fashion and fun through the harmless act of wearing a piano key necktie while reporting about the 2016 election from the lawns of Parliament House.

Infamously dubbed as “Television’s Mr Nice Guy” – we think that Charles Croucher should be able to show the world that he too deserves to be canonised in Australian Journalism history as the guy who wore a piano key necktie on the TODAY show.”

As close friend and mentor Laurie Oakes pointed in an interview with the Betoota Advocate yesterday, “If Charles were to wear a piano key necktie during a live cross from Canberra, it would be the most humanising thing Australian journalism has seen since Beaconsfield.”

“Fordham had Thredbo, Stefanovic had Childers, Croucher has the piano key necktie. This is his Walkley moment and I wish the very best to him”.

The necktie is the second round of media buzz that surrounds the former Central West NSW tighthead prop, just last week the TODAY show reporter made headlines on the campaign trail for his very-Grant-Hackett-esque, late night hotel fiasco, which saw ‘Crouch’ struggling to use a landline phone to order room service in his silk boxer shorts – luckily for him he was a long shot from the worst behaved that evening and hotel staff were more than happy to oblige his request of a triple cheeseburger on brioche.

If you would like to sign this petition to encourage a well-mannered professional to live out the Peacock-Moment he has always dreamed about. Please sign below:

Please. Let the caged bird sing.

Your sincerely,

Another close friend and mentor of Charles Croucher,

Clancy Overell

Tamworth Edition Of Q&A Postponed After Barnaby Joyce And Tony Windsor Punch On In Car Park

TEXT:

Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce and his sworn personal and political rival, Tony Windsor have spent the last 45 minutes ‘stinking on’ in the Tamworth Town Hall car park, it has been confirmed.

This breaking news comes via ABC North-West NSW, who were the first to clarify that tonight’s New England edition of Q&A has been pushed back by half an hour due to the unruly behaviour of both Federal candidates.

It is believed that ABC producers had spent the day attempting to organise two separate entrances for both Joyce and Windsor, however a last minute communication breakdown meant that both the Deputy Prime Minister and the independent candidate’s respective Landcruisers arrived simultaneously.

Earliest signs of unrest came in the shape of taunting from the Windsor camp, with the 65-year-old former Member for New England shouting from the passenger seat of his campaign car.

“Barnabbyyy… Come out to play-eh-ay!” was heard, before an array of car horns and doors slamming.

The Minister for Agriculture was then seen opening the boot of his Toyota, before opting against picking up the tyre iron underneath his daughter’s netball sportsbag.

“You wanna go, old man?” Mr Joyce was heard shouting before Windsor responded with “I’ve been waiting three years young fulla!” – the two were then seen sprinting towards each other before wrestling to the ground upon impact.

This is not the first time the two political rivals have expressed their personal dislike for one another, and as Joyce insisted while being ushered back into his car, it “won’t be the last of it”.

After the physical altercation, which lasted the better part of an hour, both men were seen puffing heavily while being dragged to opposite ends of the Town Hall car park by campaign directors. Mr Joyce has been admitted to Tamworth base hospital with several knuckle fractures, while Windsor is being treated for teeth lacerations to the right elbow in his hometown of Werris Creek.

ABC producers have confirmed that after the initial confrontation, both men agreed to ‘play nice’ and were willing to go ahead with tonight’s original broadcast timeline – until a second melee resulted in Q&A host, Tony Jones, being caught in the cross-fire of a local policemen’s capsicum spray.

According to Tony Jones, “Windsor had the scariest look in his eyes” and Mr Joyce’s skin turned a “dark shade of red”.

“Amongst the 45 minute stream of expletives, there was a lot of talk about Shenhua mine. There also seemed to be a recurring theme of religious tension between the Anglican Tony Windsor and his poorer, Catholic rival,” said Jones.

“They kept promising to behave themselves but the moment anyone turned their backs they were straight back into it,”

“I’m pretty sure Barnaby was concussed at some point,”

The time and location of a rematch has not yet been announced, but both camps say they would prefer that the public broadcaster was not present when it takes place.

Elephant-eating MP Robert Borsak reveals he wanted to eat the Cincinnati gorilla

TEXT:

THE MORE DANGEROUS THE ANIMAL, the tastier the meat.

That’s the message from embattled NSW MP Robert Borsak, who came under fire this week for shooting then eating an elephant in Zimbabwe.

However, the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers party member has revealed today that he wanted to fly to the United States earlier this month after zookeepers at a Cincinnati zoo had to shoot a gorilla to protect a child that’s fallen into the animal’s enclosure.

He wanted to fly there because he wanted to eat parts of the gorilla.

“Those zookeepers missed a rare opportunity to see what gorilla meat tastes like,” said the 63-year-old politician.

“I was ready to fly over there, but they ultimately turned me down. I only wish that I was there to pop that primate’s head open with a .338 Lapua Magnum. It would’ve been humane, that type of projectile can turn a skull inside out from over a kilometre away,”

“But it’s certainly on my bucket list – to shoot a great ape. Their numbers are tumbling in the wild so, at this rate, I might be forced to take an old sawn-off SLR into Taronga and plug one of the bastards while he’s dangling off a tyre or something.” he said.

Unregistered Voter Says Politicians Need To Start Listening To People Like Him

TEXT:

Believe it or not each election there is a large portion of Australia who aren’t really aware there is an election until the very day of it, leaving hundreds of thousands of Australians out in the democratic wilderness if they forget to enroll.

One of these voiceless individuals is Jackson Stollz, a 26-year-old-stay-at-home-son, who enjoys watching Monday night programming on the ABC when he can remember it’s on.

Though most of his friends regard him as being quite politically active, Stollz said he ‘couldn’t be fucked’ registering for the postal survey because he didn’t agree with the process – although he did post about it on Facebook.

“I don’t usually post things like this on Facebook” his status read.

“But the politicians aren’t listening to us. There’s a detachment [continues for 20 lines]”

The only thing the Port Macquarie native hates more than a representative sporting team from Queensland is the current government, which he describes at length on his public Facebook profile as a ‘pack of lyin’ dogs’.

“You’re fucking right that I’ll be filthy if these right-wingers get their way” he said.

“It’s not that I don’t like them all. What ever happened to Liberal degenerates we could get around? Like that seat-sniffing trainwreck Troy Buswell? I would’ve registered to vote if I could’ve voted for that pig,”

“But like, the process is fucking complicated to register. I opened it up on my Dell and just said ‘fuck it’. All those boxes and shit, they should just fucking put us on the roll and make it easier for everyone,”

“The cunts shouldn’t fine me for missing a local election. I care more about what happens to my DNA after it goes down the shower drain than who my mayor is.”

More to come.

LNP Unveils New Human Shelving Units For More Efficient Warehousing Of Asylum Seekers

TEXT:

Prime Minster Malcolm Turnbull has announced plans to invest $104 million into new shelf storage units for human warehousing on Nauru and in other Australian detention centres.

While talking to the media in the Xenophobic hotspot of Mackay this morning, Mr Turnbull confirmed plans to fund the new technology which could see stateless refugees and asylum seekers successfully detained at a record one person peer square metre.

Between 2000 to 3000 people currently kept in sweltering detention camps across the world would be eligible for their very own shelf, which comes with an automated feeding tube and three hours of randomised UV lighting per day.

‘This is great example of using the latest technology available to make sure our children can live normal lives,’ Mr Turnbull said, flanked by Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce and the larger Minister for Dawson, George Christensen

‘We estimate that 3000 people will be taking advantage of this, until we process them and find a country that has the space and political climate that will allow them to walk around,”

“This is the ideas boom in action!”

Health Minister Susan Ley said there was a high demand for these shelving units and that the funding was more than she had imagined.

United Patriots Front adds ‘al fresco’ and ‘a la carte’ to cuisines they hate

TEXT:

JOINING HALAL AND OTHER international dishes, the United Patriots Front has announced today that ‘al fresco’ and ‘al a carte’ cuisines have joined a growing list of foods that members have sworn off eating.

The aim of the far-right group is to spearhead a boycott on these ‘un-Australian’ industries, leading to their ultimate demise – paving the way for the locally grown produce market to thrive.

Taking the time out today to speak to the media was spokesman, Greg Mullhat, who threw down his crowbar at smoko to address the growing media pack.

“Al fresco is disgusting and should be banned,” he said, rolling a filterless White Ox cigarette.

“It’s bloody disgusting and that whole industry panders to immigrants and leaves Australian farmers out to dry – and as if it isn’t already dry enough,”

“As for al a carte, just go and flick your bean off somewhere else. It’s common knowledge that Halal products are used in al a carte food, so they can just go fuck themselves with that idea,” he said, coughing wetly before spitting something green at the feet of a pleasant-looking ABC soundman.

The impromptu press conference took place on a long stretch of anonymous Victorian highway, where Mr Mullhat was tasked with picking up general rubbish and digging holes for roadside guideposts, known elsewhere as white kangaroos.

A judge gave him the option of contributing to society the only way he can, or face a short prison sentence for burning down his own house in a negative gearing protest.

This time last year, the group rose to the national attention after explaining that Halal food was bad for the economy, as well as making many other statements which have now been shrugged off as simple hate speech by every Australians. These latest developments are expected to be treat as the same.

Peter Dutton Condemns Lazy Snowy Mountains Scheme Migrants For Taking Aussie Jobs

TEXT:

Immigration Minister Peter Dutton has been condemned for making ‘deeply offensive’ comments about the migrant intake policies in Australia during the 1950’s.

Mr Dutton made these remarks during an interview with Sky News presenter Paul Murray, stating that the Snowy Mountains Scheme was an exercise of embarrassment for the Australian people, and that those migrants who didn’t find work “languished in unemployment queues”.

“What we found in the 1950’s is that more than 100,000 people from over thirty countries came to the Snowy Mountains to work on a Hydro Electricity project. Up to 7,300 workers would provide their labour at any one time…”

“…Many of them weren’t numerate or literate in their own language, let alone English… these people were taking Australian jobs and there is no question about that,” Mr Dutton said.

According to www.Australia.gov.au, the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Scheme is by far the largest engineering project ever undertaken in Australia. It is also one of the largest and most complex hydro-electric schemes in the world. The system’s construction is seen by many as a defining point in Australia’s history, and an important symbol of Australia’s identity as an independent, multicultural and resourceful country.

While speaking to Sky News, Mr Dutton referred to this “embarrassing chapter” in Australian history as “the first and last time Australia let kindness get the best of us”.

As is recorded in the Australian National Library, seventy per cent of all the workers were migrants. They came to Australia to work on the project, attracted by the opportunities that this country offered them. At that time, soon after the Second World War, work was hard to come by in war-torn Europe.

At first, most of the workers were men who had left their families at home in Europe. Their plan was to work hard, save money and bring their families out when they could afford to.

The work was hard and the conditions were tough. Because ninety-eight per cent of the project was underground, there was a lot of tunnelling, often through solid granite rock. Work in the tunnels was dirty, wet, noisy, smelly and sometimes dangerous. More than 120 workers died in the project’s twenty-five year period.

Living conditions were also hard in the camps and towns built in the mountains to house the workers and their families. Often these dwellings were not suited to the freezing conditions. They were cold and the water would freeze in the pipes. When the workers’ wives came to join them in the townships, these women had to work hard to overcome the hardships and establish communities in the strange, new, wilderness environment. When work in one area was completed, the dwellings were dismantled and moved to another area, so very little remains of these towns today.

The majority of the workers stayed on to live in Australia after the project was completed, making a valuable contribution to Australia’s modern multicultural society.

Mr Dutton, a Federal Minister who topped the class in his tertiary studies at the Queensland police academy, says “These people were languishing in Australia’s weaknesses,”

“It’s the same with this new wave trying to become Australians today. I don’t care if they are trying to flee war-torn countries, they are coming for Aussies jobs,”

“It doesn’t matter if they are crappy jobs that Australian’s don’t want. They are Aussie jobs!”

Labor Party confirms Bill Shorten will receive participation ribbon after election

TEXT:

BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN USED TO introduce his classic tune Born To Run by saying: “nobody wins, unless everybody wins,” but he doesn’t do it anymore, because it’s just not true.

However, that’s the essence of the new mantra coming out of the Labor camp this morning, with National Secretary George Wright confirming that opposition leader Bill Shorten will receive a participation ribbon as he walks out the door come July 3.

In an effort to spare feelings and cushion the blow of being less popular than the Coalition, Australia’s oldest political party has been giving participation ribbons to each of their outgoing leaders.

In 2004, Mark Latham received his green ribbon after he was schooled by John Howard, a man who’d just led the nation into two conflicts that the UN found to be unjust.

“Yeah it was grim,” recalls Latham.

“Bomber Beazley came in and said, ‘Mate, you know what I’ve gotta [sic] do now, don’t ya?” and I said yes. He pulled out the ribbon and pinned it on my off-the-rack Kelly Country three-piece, then we both cried in each other’s arms until Simon Crean turned up with the bush chook [Emu Export] cans,”

“But everybody else who’s still in the Labor Party will get what’s coming to them and I hope they all get stuck with the green ribbon at some point.”

As the election draws closer, many political analysts and commentators agree that there’s not much Shorten can do now to save himself.

“Can’t We Just Shoot Them?” Asks Dutton

TEXT:

PRIME MINISTER MALCOLM TURNBULL has been forced to ask Immigration Minister Peter Dutton to ‘take it easy’ for the remaining forty-five days of the pre-election campaign.

This news apparently comes after the Prime Minister took a distressing phone call this morning from the former-Brisbane Police Officer, who was still rattled by an interview he had with conservative Sky News interview Paul Murray last night.

The interview, which has since made headlines today, once again sees Dutton at the centre of controversy, after he decided to berate “illiterate and innumerate” refugees for both taking Australian jobs and at the same time, not getting jobs.

“They won’t be numerate or literate in their own language, let alone English,” Mr Dutton said.

“These people would be taking Australian jobs, there’s no question about that.

“For many of them that would be unemployed, they would languish in unemployment queues and on Medicare and the rest of it so there would be huge cost and there’s no sense in sugar-coating that, that’s the scenario.”

Political commentators have likened this bizarre monologue to the South Park WWE Episode where a large group of rednecks rally together to sporadically shout ‘Dey terk our jerbs’.

It was just after these comments came into the spotlight that the Prime Minister was forced to take one of the more uncomfortable phone calls of his time in office.

Luckily, The Betoota Advocate’s Darwin correspondent was nearby when our Prime Minister accidentally answered his mobile on speakerphone while on the campaign trail this morning.

Our journalists described how Turnbull developed a thin film of clammy sweat above his brow as he was asked by the Minister Of Immigration, “Can’t we just shoot them”.

“If you are asking me what I think you are asking me… No, Peter. No we definitely cannot” responded the the Prime Minister.

“In fact, I’m surrounded by media, mate. Get on WickR if you want to ask me hectic questions like that,”

“I don’t want to hear about this again. Can’t you go and bust someone smuggling cigarettes or something. That was very Abbott of you.”

Peter Dutton has refused to give comment today, but once again, he has outlined that he will not be blackmailed by human decency when it comes to the livelihood of stateless refugee families.

Local Dad repeats ‘Fuck me, dead’ over and over watching Q&A

TEXT:

AFTER BEING SUCKERED INTO watching ABC’s Q&A in his own home by his left-leaning family, 69-year-old Micheal Houston said he couldn’t help saying “Fuck me, dead,” over and over again.

Having spent his entire working life as a small business owner, the semi-retired farmer says that he used to have a small amount of faith in the future of Australia, but after seeing last night’s program, he said he’s ready to die now.

Sitting on the corner of a lumpy IKEA couch that the wife bought using his credit card, Michael wanted to watch something interesting like Embarrassing Bodies or the Formula One, but no.

“Look, I might be a bitter old bastard, but fuck me with a length of rope and call me Sally. Enough is enough,” he said.

Talking over the top of Tony Jones like he was sitting next to him in a crowded bar, Michael began to explain why everybody on the show is wrong.

“When I was that Kate woman’s age, I got plucked out of a good job and sent to South East Asia to go jump out of helicopters and shoot communists. Then you’ve got people like my boy, who sook about being locked out of nightclubs and not being able to afford a home in a nice suburb. The fucking doormat lies in bed till noon some days.”

Houston then reportedly got up off the couch and continued his rant from the kitchen, unable to watch any more of the Monday night leftie heroin.

Gesturing wildly with his hands, he went on to remark that his first home was in a not-so-nice part of town.

“The first fucking home I bought was in a bad area, cunt I had to get off the train at night with a bit of reo bar up my sleeve in case some junkie cunt tried to pull me on,”

“One night I flogged this fucking smackie so hard about the head, he was flopping up and down on the footpath like a carp on a riverbank. Tell me that was fun,”

“I’m just fucking sick of it. I fucking am!”

Declaring an end to his monologue, Michael then retired to his shed and put on some Bob Dylan. Thinking his wife still doesn’t know, years after he said he quit, he put his feet up on the workbench and enjoyed a Longbeach while he mulled over his life.

A government study commissioned by the ABC last year found that it’s extremely difficult for homeowners over the age of 60 to watch Q&A because it mainly features people complaining about something, or young Australians whining about being broke.

The report concluded with a number of recommendations, which controversially included Gen Y battlers continuing to encourage their Baby Boomers to take up smoking, in the hopes that they’ll get their hands on a bit of travel money a few years earlier.

Bill Shorten reveals he maintains his cool composure by screaming into pillows

TEXT:

DESPITE BEHIND IN NEARLY every poll, Opposition leader Bill Shorten has been cooler than a cucumber  this election campaign, which he chalks up to one simple trick.

“I scream into a pillow three times a day,” reveals the 49-year-old, who celebrated his birthday on Thursday.

“The goose feather ones work the best. I got one for my birthday this week. It’s really good, a mark of a good pillow is its weight. You don’t want those cheap shit Kmart ones, the whole block will hear you if you scream into one of those,”

“After I do some screaming, I feel ten times better.”

Though it’s still too early to tell, many political analysts have written off the former union boss, saying that even with Scott Morrison, Peter Dutton and Greg Hunt by his side, the prime minister is going to win this election by a long way.

Six-time Walkley Award-winning journalist Kerry O’Brien remarked that Shorten’s ability to keep his composure under intense questioning has improved in recent months – something he says is nothing short of a miracle.

Now that details of Shorten’s pillow screaming have been made public, O’Brien agrees that this new revelation alone will save him from dipping to Brendan Nelson-levels of public dissatisfaction.

“Pillow screaming has always been a popular method for media professionals and political figures to help get through rough patches,” said O’Brien.

“Print journalists have been screaming in pillows for a number of years now, but they all act like everything is going to be OK for them, which it won’t,”

“Same goes for Bill.”

“Ram-Raids Are A Perfect Example Of The Australian Ideas Boom” Says Turnbull

TEXT:

Often described as “Australia’s Drive-By” – the ram-raid is a variation of burglary in which a vehicle is driven through the windows or doors of a closed shop, usually a department store or jewellers shop, to allow the perpetrators to loot it.

The ram-raid is a universal method of robbery, however, over the last twenty years it has experienced quite a resurgence in Australia, following the Howard Government’s introduction of strict gun control laws in 1996.

Former Western Sydney career criminal, Leslie Boyd, says the “world has gone and got itself in a hurry”.

“Back in my day it was much easier,” says the 62-year-old, who hasn’t been involved in an armed robbery since 1992.

“We had a formula… Steal a car, walk in the front door, sawn-off shotty to the mouth, hands in the till, roll out, burn the car”

“Nowadays these poor young fellas have to fuck around with two stolen cars. One that goes through the front windows, and another on the street for the getaway,”

“Not to mention the fact that they need to trudge through a structurally unsound building with shattered glass everywhere. Its just flat out unsafe”

However, not everyone seems to feel the same way about ram-raid robberies.

Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull says the idea of driving a stolen car through the front of a service station with intent to steal cigarettes, scratchies and possibly an entire ATM, is a true testament to Australia’s entrepreneurial spirit.

“Our innovation agenda is going to help create the modern, dynamic 21st century economy Australia needs.” he said.

“The ram-raid is a perfect example of an industry that has managed to keep up, simply by changing tactics,”

The Prime Minister says it is a relief to see that even “the lowest rung” of society can prove themselves as contributors to his vague concept of an “ideas boom”.

“Unlike a mining boom, it is a boom that can continue forever, it is limited only by our imagination, and I know that Australians believe in themselves, I know that we are a creative and imaginative nation.”

“Ram-raids, and the perpetrators have proven that the entreprenuerial Australian still lives on in the outskirts of Australian capital cities. The Sir Sidney Kidman, R.M Williams, Frank Packer brand of Australian pioneers are still very alive,”

“I for one commend these men in their relatively non-violent ways

Q&A’s Duncan Storrar named in Panama Papers

TEXT:

SELF-CONFESSED TAX PAYER and welfare recipient Duncan Storrar shot to fame earlier this week after going into bat for Aussie battlers on ABC’s Q&A.

This morning, he’s famous for another reason.

Alongside this morning’s revelations surrounding Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull’s involvement, the 45-year-old father of two was once a director of an offshore company set up by Mossack Fonseca, data from the Panama Papers shows.

Despite declaring on national television that he was doing it hard, that he was broke, this latest development says anything but.

Mr Storrar has addressed the allegations, saying he wasn’t aware that the small logistics company he was named a director of was, in fact, incorporated in the British Virgin Islands through services provided by Mossack Fonseca.

The company, Storrar & Nephew Pty, has been linked to a number of small contracts to deliver goods such as milk and newspapers in the greater Geelong area – whereby most of the invoices were paid to an offshore company.

From 1994 to 2011, Storrar worked sporadically as a delivery driver for the company, despite being on the board. This was to maintain the illusion of being a low-income worker, which his Australian bank accounts would reflect.

But, the real story is much different.

“I pay tax, just like everybody else,” said the downtrodden Victorian.

“But I’m no longer a director of Storrar & Nephew and had I known the company structure as it’s been outlined today, I would’ve made arrangements to have that rectified so we’d be paying the correct amount of tax.”

“Like that rich guy once said, if you don’t minimise your tax debt, then you ought to get your head read.”

Mr Storrar’s financial activity from 1994 onwards is now subject to an ongoing Tax Office investigation, in partnership with the Australian Federal Police.

Should the Geelong resident be linked to any misconduct linked to his position as a director of  Storrar & Nephew, then he may face possible gaol time.

More to come.

Governor-General Impressed By Malcolm Turnbull’s Attitude

TEXT:

Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has today visited the Governor-General Peter Cosgrove to ask for a double-dissolution election. He then launched the nation’s longest election campaign since the 1960s, culminating with a July 2 poll.

With the current Government’s pre-election promises currently under the spotlight, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull says the path is clear for the “greatest years in our nation’s history” – and it seems he won over former Australian Chief of Army and Chief of the Defence Force, General Sir Peter John Cosgrove, AK, MC.

Speaking to The Betoota Advocate this afternoon, The Governor-General said he himself was initially apprehensive about the Prime Minister’s pleas to dissolve the Parliament in preparation for an election, but quickly changed his tune when he was made aware of the fact that Malcolm Turnbull had arrived at Government house with a 30-block of ice cold green tins.

“Fuck, I didn’t need much convincing after that. That handsome silverfox knows how to do business!” chuckled the 68-year-old representative of Her Majesty.

“Any bloke who rocks up to my place on a Sunday arvo with a block of Victor Bravos and a deck of stuyvies is a fine by me,”

“He treated our meeting with the respect it deserved, and he’d done is research. I’m a military man and I enjoy all things green – It also allowed us to skip the niceties and get down to business,”

However, while it seems the Prime Minister has sailed smoothly through today’s meetings and announcements, ABC political commentator Barrie Cassidy has pointed out that arriving at Government house with a cold carton of tins could be considered a form a political bribery.

“It all comes down to how many beers Mr Turnbull had alongside the Governor-General,” he said to ABC 24.

“If it was a case of him having 1 or 2 and leaving the rest of them to Cosgrove, then he might have an issue,”

“If he stuck around for more than six, well obviously that’s more of a shout. It’s something that everyone is going to be looking at in the next few days regardless,”

“A lot of people are under the impression that Turnbull would have to be half-drunk all the time with some of the shit he keeps pulling out before this election, but he seems to be impressing the right people.”

New Footage Shows Depp Secretly Giving Joyce The Rude Finger During Apology

TEXT:

In what appears to be one last snub of his nose to Australian quarantine laws, new footage has today revealed that Johnny Depp wasn’t actually that sincere during his official apology to Australia yesterday afternoon.

A photo, tweeted by the actor, at 11:30pm last night – shows his right hand performing a rude hand gesture underneath the table. This was also followed by a series of offensive tweets directed at the Deputy Prime Minister.

Johnny Depp’s wife, Amber Heard was handed a one-month good behaviour bond with no conviction recorded after smuggling her two Yorkshire terriers into Australia last year while visiting her husband.

After previously threatening to shoot her two dogs, the Minister for Agriculture, who is now Deputy Prime Minister, has forced the Hollywood couple to apologise on an iPhone camera before sharing it over social media.

Mr Joyce said that he hoped the video released by Depp and his wife would help reinforce the message that Australia’s biosecurity laws were not “a joke”.

However, the joke may be on the Member for New England, as new footage reveals that Johnny Depp was actually giving the rude finger to the Deputy Prime Minister while recording the video.

The photo, which has was tweeted out by Depp from his his private jet on the way back to Hollywood, has since been taken down from social media, but not before it was screen captured by our cunning journalists at the Betoota Advocate.

Barnaby Joyce was also the victim of a series of vitriolic tweets from the jilted dog-owner, all of which were also deleted from twitter upon landing in Hollywood this morning.

Barnaby Joyce spoke to the media this morning, where he compared Mr Depp’s Yorkshire Terriers to cane toads.

“Yorkshire Terriers need to be declared and controlled, otherwise they need to be put down. These bloody things are everywhere. They’re in the lift, in the lorry, in the bond wizard, and all over the malonga gilderchuck.”

“He can say what he wants now that he’s outside of the country. But I’ll tell ya one thing, he’s lucky all he had to do was apologise,”

Initially we worked out a compromise that will allow both nations to save face. We argued them down to…a booting. The Prime Minister wanted to kick him once, through the gate, with a regular shoe.”

“But, of course, this PC brigade came out in force. Either way, we saw him swallow his pride on camera. My work here is done,”

It is not yet known if Johnny Depp plans on coming back to Australia, but one thing that is clear is that our bio-safety laws are much more important than his feelings.

Barnaby Joyce and The Nationals host ‘outrageous’ house party at The Lodge

TEXT:

NOW THAT MALCOLM TURNBULL HAS left the country, Barnaby Joyce and his friends from The Nationals have the keys to the kingdom – and they’ve thrown the biggest party at The Lodge since John Howard’s infamous 17-day bender after Australia won the 1999 Cricket World Cup.

Early this morning, a Tooheys Brewery B-Double was seen near the Parliamentary Circle on the way to the prime minister’s residence.

Speaking this afternoon to The Advocate via telephone, Joyce said he and the boys from the bush were really turning one on, now that there’re no squares around to stop them.

“Yeeeaaaaahhhhh moyeeet!!! Get your arse over her, ya bastard! We’re gonna throw Bill Heffernan off the roof into the pool at 5 o’clock,” yelled Joyce.

“I’m in the bastard’s office now drinking his scotch. His phonebook hasn’t got Mr Depp’s number in it but anyway mate get down here. Just get a cab and I’ll throw him the party credit card.”

Mr Joyce then handed the phone to the Member for Calare, John Cobb, who explained that everybody present is there to get turnt up.

“Me and Coulto [Mark Coulton, Member for Parkes] were having a few darts in Mal’s bedroom and we accidently burnt a few holes in the sheets,” said Cobb.

“They were those flash ‘gyppo’ cotton ones, aye. He’ll go ape when he gets home. Oi, who is this by the way?”

The father of seven dropped the phone on the floor and left, leaving an audible argument between John Anderson and Mark Vaile being picked up by the receiver.

Vaile was telling the last member for Gwydir that they shouldn’t throw Bill Heffernan off the roof because “he’s getting a bit old for that kind of rough-housing” and “he’s not even a National” but Anderson was adiment that if he wants to party with The Nationals, he has to start acting like one.

“I don’t care if the old growler’s over 70, I’m throwing him off the roof into the pool,” said Anderson.

“Mate, ya can’t! I’m pretty sure he’s got a pacemaker and everything. He’s not hurting anyone. Look, he’s just down there enjoying a drink with Fifi [Fiona Nash],” said Vaile.

“Nah fuck him, mate. I’m gunna do it!”

Sydney Cop Reveals He Once Arrested Mike Baird For Shandy-Related Violence

TEXT:

Senior Constable Steve Giles is retiring today after 47 years as a New South Wales police officer. In that time, he estimates he has arrested more than 10,000 people. But one arrest stands out: Mike Baird.

“It was Easter time at 1989. I was stationed in Kings Cross and we got a call about a fight. We turned up and found a couple of blokes having a blue. A witness told us that this kid in a pink shirt had king hit some bloke. So we arrested him,”

“In the back of the car, he wouldn’t shut up. He’d had a skin-full. Kept telling us he was Bruce Baird’s son and he’d have us sacked,”

As many Sydneysiders would remember, the reputable police officers from Darlinghurst station were notorious for being ‘incorruptible’ throughout the 70s, 80s and 90s

Steve Giles was one of these true blue coppers, but unfortunately the paper work never made it out the door.

“We took him to the station and charged him with assault and public drunkenness. While he was in the drunk tank sobering up, his old man made some calls and the whole thing was hushed up.”

“Turns out it was more of a slap from behind than a punch, but still, I was always by the book and I’ll never forget being forced to let the little prick go,”

“I’ve got the mugshot here, but I doubt even that’s enough evidence for this bloke to admit he was in the wrong. He’ll probably just start yelling skewed statistics,”

In 1989, Mike Baird’s father, Bruce Baird AM, was the Member for Northcott – and much like his son, the current NSW Premier, he had a lot of powerful friends.

Steve Giles’ admission makes for an interesting revelation, especially when considering the Premier’s current stand on political corruption.

“We will not tolerate corruption in this State, end of story,” said Mike Baird last year, in reference to Independent Commission Against Corruption, a Government agency responsible for his predecessor and political mentor’s resignation.

If proven to be true, the political intervention into Giles’ alleged arrest of Mike Baird would most definitely stack up alongside the almost irrefutable indicators that suggest the NSW Premier is currently being ‘looked after’ by casino owners and Kings Cross property developers.

Speaking to the media today, Mike Baird has dismissed the allegations that he was arrested on would have been his 21st Birthday, over the Easter weekend of 1989″

“Look, I am a human too. I was young once,” said the troubled Premier who is currently seeing his worst polls since before he gave a 17-hour press conference during the Martin Place Siege.

“…and when I was young it was a different culture. Usually, young people would be able drink all night and no one would get hurt. Plus we didn’t have all these westie nightclub owners,”

“I was never much of a drinker though, so the idea that this alleged incident was alcohol related is ridiculous. I remember my 21st well, I only had six shandys (three standard drinks)”

A Shandy is beer mixed with a soft drink, such as carbonated lemonade, ginger beer, ginger ale, or apple juice or orange juice. The proportions of the two ingredients are adjusted to taste, usually half-and-half. It is very common with affluent and politicised Christian surfers who can’t be seen to let their cheery guard down when out in public.

The Premier, who is responsible for imposing the current lock-out that have caused a sharp decline in Sydney’s hospitality and nightlife precincts, also denied claims that he ‘coward-punched’ someone on his 21st birthday.

“What everyone needs to remember is, I am the person who actually coined the term ‘coward-punch’ – As I did with ‘alcohol-related violence’ – So I can confidently say that I am innocent of these things,”

“It was a play fight that turned awry after our mates Christian rock gig, yeah I shouldn’t have slapped him but, hey, sometimes things happen when your out on the town,”

Baird also denied claims of political intervention.

“I am not corrupt. Assaults are down by 40% – it’ll take a lot to move me from that.”

Exotic Day Spa Industry Booms With New Medicare Rebate For “Special Massages”

TEXT:

Australia’s exotic day spa industry is expected to see a boom in business heading into the new financial year, with the government’s announcement that “special massages” will now be tax deductible.

The federal treasurer, Scott Morrison, announced the changes last week, stating that ‘Special Massage’ will be included in a tax deductible health services category.

In the seven days since, business analysts believe that trade has gone up 90% in Australia’s exotic day spa industry.

Westmead brick layer, Leo Falcone, says the changes have restored his faith in the Liberal Government.

“It’s about time we’re allowed to claim things that are actually useful” said the father of three.

“I’ve been going to Misty’s every Saturday night since I was 19 – if these laws came in 10 years ago… I could have put my kids through private school”

However, Brisbane accountant John Nguyen says it could be more difficult to claim the ‘late night special’ than people realise.

“What you need to understand is that if you are audited, you need to show receipts stating that clarifies when and where you received these services,”

“Generally, your local rub’n’tug joint will list payments under a more subtle title, making it hard to prove to the ATO,”

“I mean good luck claiming ‘special visit to doctor’ in June. Some even go down as a ‘movie night’… It’s a tough one”

“There’s also the issue of your significant other finding these declarations if you do your tax together,”

Nguyen says that as a result of the changes, he will only be providing tax services to single men and women.

“I’ve had couples go ape shit in my office over porn subscriptions – imagine the shit fight this will cause. I don’t need that stress”

Not everyone is a skeptical as Nguyen however, and Mr Falcone says he’s willing to take the risk.

“If the missus finds out… I’ll just buy her a new handbag. You can deduct those on tax now anyway”

“I’ve always been a very worldly bloke and I’ve become accustomed to oriental culture in my travels to and from the pub,”

Bill Shorten Crawls Through River Of Shit To Attend Press Conference

TEXT:

OPPOSITION LEADER BILL SHORTEN revealed he had to shimmy through raw sewerage to attend a press conference this morning in Canberra.

Speaking from a courtyard within Parliament House, the 48-year-old former trade unionist said the reason why he hasn’t announced alternative policy or even said anything publically this year is because he needed time to reflect on his desire to lead.

Always doing everything the hard way, the valiant Victorian found solace in wriggling through the human waste and effluvium of nearby Kingston and Barton for the past three months. A time he feels was critical in shaping his political ambitions this year.

“Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies,” shouted Shorten as he slammed his fists down on the lectern.

“I must admit I didn’t think much of Malcolm first time I laid eyes on him; looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over. That was my first impression of the man. We can beat him.”

Shorten told the two dozen strong crowd of journalists and bleary-eyed gardeners that he was ready to steer the country back into the red, improving the quality of life of every Australian. Even if it meant asking Wayne Swan to come in from the cold.

Many commentators and analysts have long said that the trenches within the Labor Party go deeper than the wrinkles on Barrie Cassidy’s forehead.

“I want to make sure we have the best Labor minds here on deck for this election. I want all the big names,” said Shorten.

“Do any of you guys know who the shadow treasurer is without googling it? Didn’t think so. I don’t even know who my goddamn treasurer is.”

Doctors unable to determine why Warringah man still wakes up screaming

TEXT:

A CASE OF NIGHT TERRORS has left doctors scratching their heads after a local man still wakes up screaming at all hours of the night after six months of unsuccessful treatments.

It’s a case that’s got the attention of medical professionals around the country.

Community man Anthony Abbott has suffered from night terrors since losing his job last September. Though he says the experience was quite traumatic, he’s still been offered a job which pays roughly half of what he used to receive, but it also comes with a handsome pension.

“I don’t think losing my job has anything to do with my night screaming,” says the 58-year-old former journalist.

“That wasn’t the first job I’ve lost. Every journalist in the country has or will lose their job at some point. I think it goes much deeper than that.”

The curious case of Mr Abbott has lured world-leading neurologist Dr Hans Goerths, an Austrian doctor specialising in sleep yelling. Arriving in Sydney last month, he’s planning to perform a barrage of tests on the avid cyclist.

Goerths has his own opinions as to what might be causing the problem.

“I don’t think it’s the trauma of losing his job that’s the issue here, I think it’s more or less the fact that the man who replaced him is doing a far better job,” said the doctor.

“From my limited understanding of Australian politics, even Simon Crean would’ve beaten him in this year’s election, which speaks volumes of my patient. I’m advising him to stay active in the community, but he needs to give up on his dreams. He’s not Malcolm Turnbull… and he’s certainly not Kevin Rudd.”

“If You Can’t Fight On Rum, You Can’t Fight” Says Deputy Prime Minister

TEXT:

Only a few months after taking part in an alleged “pub brawl” in the Lyceum hotel in Longreach, Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce has declared that anyone who drinks dark rum and doesn’t fight, can’t fight.

On the tenth of May, Mr Joyce refuted claims that he had been “run out of town” – despite the fact he was sporting an obvious black eye after “vast amounts” of “sugar cane champagne” in the Western Queensland agricultural hub.

The incident has made its way into headlines once again today after Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull today hinted at a double dissolution as early as April.

When asked if he thought it was appropriate to have a rum-swilling outback pub brawler as our deputy Prime Minister, Barnaby Joyce claimed it could have been anyone in his position.

“The bottom line is, it’d be more of a concern about if I didn’t get into a blue with those ferals in Longreach

“That’s how you’ve got to carry yourself in those parts. And if you can’t fight on rum, you can’t fight – and If you can’t fight in Longreach, then you’ve got no hope as a National politician.”

The Member for New England’s claim – that it is natural to experience a pulsating aggression through your fists after drinking dark rum – has been met with criticisms from trendy inner-city ‘Sailor Jerry’ enthusiasts.

Newtown resident, Banjo Clementé says he very much considers himself a dark rum drinker – and that he has never been in a fistfight – despite the fact that he is a black-belt in Brazillan Capoeira.

“I would have had upwards of seven glasses of sailor jerry and dry at a Cat Empire concert over the weekend. Not once did I even think of using my martial arts skills on someone’s face,”

“The Deputy Prime Minister is the definition of an outdated regional mindset running our country. Let’s stop talking about the drought… It doesn’t affect me. Let’s talk about the WestConnex!”

Mr Joyce’s comments about the affects of rum on the Australian male have been run by ABC Fact Checker. Here are the results.

“If you can’t fight on rum, you can’t fight,” Deputy Leader of the Nationals Barnaby Joyce told ABC News.

Does rum really only have an aggressive effect on people who can handle themselves in a blue, as Mr Joyce says?

Mr Joyce’s claim checks out. In accordance with the context of his claim, ABC Fact Checker found that he was most definitely referring to drinking rum derived of North Queensland sugar-cane, and that it was either mixed with coca-cola or milk.

It was also noted that, when considering the location of this specific incidence, Barnaby Joyce was in no way referring to Sailor Jerry or any other form of “spice rum”.

A recent study by the CSIRO finds that roughly 92.9% of Australian men claim to have been involved in a physical altercation after spending the evening drinking coca-cola with sugarcane champagne.

This number was not inclusive of the types of men involved in said bar fights. Fact Check was unable to find one dataset that definitively measures someone’s ability to fight.

Studies indicate that the rate of rum-related violence might be even higher than Barnaby Joyce predicted – due to a large amount of Australian men who are unable to fight but still try to anyway.

Barnaby Joyce Involved In Rum-Fuelled Altercation At Lyceum Hotel In Longreach

TEXT:

This morning it was announced that Tony Windsor will go head to head against the Deputy Prime Minister to win back his old seat of New England. This ends months of speculation about a political comeback to parliament for the independent politician.

Meanwhile, in an attempt to keep his supporters in the National Party heartland onside, Barnaby Joyce spent last night rallying locals at one of the most notorious western Queensland pubs.

Built in 1896, the Lyceum Hotel in Longreach is well-known for its rowdy atmosphere, even on weeknights, and it seems the fact that the second-highest ranking politician in the country was visiting didn’t change much.

Speaking to media in Roma this morning, Mr Joyce refuted claims that he had been “run out of town” – despite the fact he was sporting an obvious black eye.

“It was just like any other night in Longreach,” said the Deputy Prime Minister, between sips from a 1.2 litre Frozen Coke he had picked up at the Roma McDonalds.

“It was a good catch up with some of my old mates out there. It started off a bit hostile because, initially, they thought I had gotten a bit big for my boots,”

“But after letting the air into a few [consuming copious amounts of XXXX bitter cans], I was able to win them over”

Mr Joyce says his visit was received well in Longreach, home of the Stockman’s Hall of Fame.

“Yeah I had put a few of the punters back in line,” he said, before consuming half a ‘Mighty Angus’ burger in one bite.

“There’s always a lot of shit-talk in towns like this, so I had to let them know I was still very much a St George boy. They thought they had lost me to Canberra,”

“We came to an agreement, after a fair few black rats and a bit of persuading from my end,”

When questioned as to how he was able to travel seven hours before talking to the media this morning, Mr Joyce ensured us that he was not driving.

“Nah, I put one of the staffers behind the wheel the moment the sun went up,”

“There’s a lot going on in the world you know. As Deputy PM, I can’t afford to lose my licence,”

Clive Palmer reveals his favourite film is 2003 epic Gigli

TEXT:

IN THE SAME WEEK THAT Clive Palmer pledged to save Queensland Nickel from collapse, the 61-year-old exposed a part of himself that’s seldom seen in his world of high finance and politics – a love of classic cinema.

Nodding to early masterpieces such as the 1936 landmark film Reefer Madness, a tale detailing the dangers of smoking marijuana and Hobgoblins, a late eighties horror film that famously caused Palmer’s first stroke, nothing compares to his favorite film of all time.

“Like Mulholland Drive, I think that people tend to get the wrong end of the stick when it comes to Gigli,” said Palmer.

“It’s a work of art and you need to take a few steps back to see the big picture. There’s never any on-screen chemistry anymore. You don’t get real Hollywood relationships like ‘Bennifer’ anymore, at least not like they were in the 90’s.”

Despite being panned by nearly every critic in the free world, Gigli has garnered a cult following that includes Australia’s 30th most wealthy person, who regards the film has his most favorite.

Starring Jennifer Lopez, Ben Affleck, Christopher Walken and Al Pacino, it seemed the movie was too big to fail, but it did.

It’s widely regarded as one of the worst films of all time. Robert Ebert, one of history’s most famous film critics, was watching the movie with friends short after it’s VHS release when about ten minutes into the film, his eyes rolled back into his head and he lost consciousness.

Ebert’s aneurysm occurred when Lopez’s character revealed that she was a lesbian.

Prior to making the call on the Queensland Nickel crisis, Clive consulted the lifesize cut-out of Ben Affleck that stands in the corner of the reception in his Maroochydore electorate office.

“I think there’s a bit of Larry Gigli in all of us. I keep him close because, like me, we’ve both had to choose between love, power and money.”

“We’ve all had a crazy woman like Ricki in our lives, too. It hits home.”

Minister For Women Refuses To Be Labelled A Woman

TEXT:

Minister for Women Michaelia Cash’s stubborn refusal to identify as a woman has been met with criticisms, after the heterosexual female declared she is not interested in carrying labels on last night’s episode of ABC Q&A.

During the program, Michaelia Cash also refused to associate herself with the tag of ‘feminist’ – which came in contrast to broadcaster Alan Jones, who gladly accepted the label. Alongside two of Australia’s most high-profile feminist icons, Penny Wong and Mia Freedman, the 2GB presenter insisted he was solidly pro-gender equality.

However, Michaelia Cash went as far as saying she also refuses to be labelled a woman, as it is unnecessary for her to carry such titles in her position as Minister For Women.

“I am fundamentally committed to gender equality and I see the responsibility that I have as the Minister for Women as being a great one,” said Miss* Cash.

“Do I think that I can be the Minister for Women, be passionate about my commitment to gender equality, put in place policies that will ensure that as Australians we move towards gender equality and yet not label myself a woman? Yes, I do,”

Her comments were met with uproar from both Freedman and Wong, who said that it was hard enough under the Abbott government with a male Minister For Women, and that identifying as a woman should be very much a part of the job.

“No!” said the Senator.

“Tony Abbott did a fine job as a Minister For Women and he didn’t need to carry the woman label. Neither do I!”

The robust debate was predictably cut short by Q&A host Tony Jones – who moved on to the next question, which came from a recently retrenched maritime worker, who asked if 457 visas were saturating the Australian job workforce.

Ms* Cash then spent the next few minutes berating the middle-aged man for not being as competitive as foreign workers.

“We need to be competitive in a global market, and if that means laying blokes like you off to bring in cheaper brown people. Then so be it,”

Michaelia Cash says the only label she is willing to carry is ‘Liberal’.

Photo Of Tony Abbott’s New Tribal Tattoo Suggests He Might Be Having A Mid-Life Crisis

TEXT:

A photograph of Tony Abbott’s newest tattoo has resulted in a buzz amongst political commentators, who suggest the vaguely tribal-themed body art in a clear indication of the former Prime Minister’s suspected mid-life crisis.

The photo, which was picked up by photographers working for Weetbix at a triatholon fundraiser over the weekend, joins a long a list of sure sign indicators.

“First it was the new sports car, then it was the drum kit… Then there was talk of a bit of trouble with his marriage… “says Australian political commentator, Kevin Hardwick.

I think the tribal tattoo makes it official. Tony Abbott is having a big ol’ mid-life crisis,”

“I mean, we’ve all had that realisation that we are no longer the young fella we used to be… But I think a tattoo is a very lame way of dealing with it,”

Tony Abbott’s suspected mid-life crisis first made headlines in February this year – after it was revealed that his wife, Margie, had referred to his new sports car as a ‘menoporsche’.

Hardwick says the alleged mid-life crisis was most certainly triggered by the fact that he was overthrown in his position of Prime Minister late last year by a much more youth-oriented and ‘cooler’ Liberal party rival.

“Here’s Abbott sitting in the back bench, denying an affair with a married woman, while Turnbull and his wife are down in Oxford street for the Mardi Gras..”

“…He just doesn’t have it, and a tattoo is very pitiful attempt at appearing cool,”

These mid-life crisis allegations join an explosive account of former prime minister Tony Abbott’s downfall by Australian political journalist Niki Savva.

The book, titled ‘The Road to Ruin’ will be released on Monday, with excerpts from the book already grabbing headlines – Including how the Former PM was seen “slapping the buttocks” of chief of staff Peta Credlin.

The alleged buttock slapping incident is said to have happened in front of an unnamed minister, who Mr Abbott did not know was there.

Ms Credlin is said to have responded to the slap with a smile.

Bill Shorten To Shirtfront Gay Rights By Taking Shirt Off At Mardi Gras

FOR THE FIRST TIME, a leader of a major political party will march in the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras.

Opposition leader Bill Shorten confirmed earlier this month that he will stand shoulder to shoulder with the nation’s QUILTBAG (“Queer/Questioning, Undecided, Intersex, Lesbian, Trans (Transgender/Transsexual), Bisexual, Asexual, Gay) community in a show of unsurpassed support.

As he does every year, PM Malcolm Turnbull will also be attending the event because it falls within his electorate, but he will not be taking part in the actual march.

If anybody has wondered where the 48-year-old former trade unionist has been for the past four months, the mystery has been solved.

“I’ve been pumping iron,” remarked Shorten.

“This day is very important to me. I’m shirtfronting the problem of gay inequality in Australia. I’m getting my lid off. I’m going to have fun. This type of social discrimination has simply gone on for too long.”

The prime minister was also quick to show his support for his political rival, saying that in a perfect world, he could march, too.

“Look, I’d love to march. But I’d also like to keep my job,” said Turnbull.

“The thing is, I’m a relatively normal person. I’m very pro-gay-rights and I hate the church, but I’ve got to tow the company line here. That means keeping these Jesus freaks on the backbench happy.”

Going against his recent trend, Shorten made headlines last month after a chance run-in with vehemently anti-gay and pro-family senator Cory Bernardi, where some heated words were exchanged.

Bernardi said the opposition leader that he was “living in sin.”

Speaking today from  his current UN posting in New York City, the 46-year-old rimfire conservative had some choice words for both the prime minister and the opposition leader.

“I’m urging the PM not to attend, but I’m supporting Bill’s decision to attend,” said Bernardi.

“There’s still time to save Malcolm’s soul from eternal damnation. Bill is going to hell.”

Former PM Admits He Used To Self-Medicate With High-Powered Nimbin Bush

TEXT:

Last week, the Australian parliament passed new national laws today paving the way for the use of medicinal cannabis by people with painful and chronic illness.

Amendments to the Narcotic Drugs Act permit both legally-grown cannabis for the manufacture of medicinal cannabis products in Australia. The changes, proposed earlier this month by the Turnbull government, had bi-partisan support.

Surprisingly, one of the loudest advocates for ‘legalising it’ was former Prime Minister, Tony Abbott MP.

“I have always endorsed the legalisation of buds,” Tony Abbott told Charles Croucher from Nine News.

“Back in the day, I used to suffer extreme insomnia as a result of being a member of the young Liberals. I couldn’t find anything that worked,”

“That was until me and my squad went on a camping trip to north New South Wales – [laughter] – You can only imagine what I discovered up there,”

Abbott was not shy to declare his love from several different strains of cannabis.

“When I was a young fella we used to just smoke that Nimbin bush. It was great for a bit of a giggle,”

“But nowadays I’m getting right into my hydro… A bit of PNG Gold here and there,”

“[laughter] talk about Port Moresby time! That shit slows you right down,” said Mr Abbott as he continued to praise the marijuana cultivation of our north Pacific neighbours.

“You think you’ve smoked weed? Well until you’ve ripped a cone through a coke bottle in the streets of Moresby… You haven’t. That shit is dank.”

While recreational cannabis cultivation and use remains illegal with state-based criminal laws still in place.

Senator Bernardi Settles In For His Nightly Corrective Shock Therapy After A Big Day In Parliament

TEXT:

After a hard day at work, Liberal Senator Cory Bernardi is relieved to be at home with his wife Sinead Bernardi, the Bible, and his two young children who were conceived through a strict missionary program several months after his marriage.

A big day in Parliament, and a media blitz right across the country, saw Senator Bernardi under fire for his part in pressuring Prime Minister Turnbull into requesting an investigation into a taxpayer-funded program aimed at helping lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and/or intersex (LGBTI) school students.

After being referred to as a homophobe in the halls of Parliament house by the leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, Mr Bernardi needs a drink.

But he can’t have one because that would be sinful, and it would align him with the hedonistic lifestyles he works tirelessly to legislate against.

Instead he unwinds by cranking up his Yamaha Shock Therapy Kit.

“He usually sits the pads on his forehead. But if he’s a bit stressed, he put them on his temple,” says a close male friend friend of the Senator.

“He’s sooooo fierce. He just works himself up in Parliament and never finds a chance to relax. That shock therapy dial will be buzzing at around ten tonight. It doesn’t go any higher”

As a lifelong advocate of shock therapy rituals, it is believed Mr Bernardi began using the machine as a young teenager, as a way to correct himself into being the best Christian man he could be.

“I think he had some nasty, hedonistic, sinful thoughts, when he was trying to find himself. The shock therapy really helped” says a former pastor who chose to remain anonymous.

“He usually falls asleep on the couch with that thing,”

“It keeps him relaxed about life, about himself, and the work he does,”

“You can only imagine the stress that would build if you had to go head to head with all of these gay sympathisers ever day. Every time he’s had a run in with the LGBTI community he just comes home and cranks the shock therapy,”

Following the appointment of the ‘less conservative’ Malcolm Turnbull following last year’s liberal spill motion, senator Bernardi lashed his colleagues for “disloyalty” and “treachery” saying some had given up their credibility “pretty cheaply” by abandoning former prime minister Tony Abbott in favour of Malcolm Turnbull.

In an interview with Andrew Bolt, Mr Bernardi was quoted as saying “you’ve got to have voices at the table and if we are going to be a party that goes down the path of being more like Labor than like the traditional Liberal vision, which is a distinctly conservative vision, then who knows what will happen?

“But I don’t want it to come to that, Andrew, I want us to be a mainstream conservative party, rather than just a vehicle for anything goes, as long as I can climb the greasy pole.”

Turnbull Retires His Use Of The Words “Exciting” and “Innovative”

TEXT:

Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull returned from his trip “Up North” over the weekend, with very little to talk about.

“Richard Di Natale [Greens Party Leader] was right when he said God has forgotten about that awful, awful place – 1/3” the Prime Minister tweeted earlier today.

“I mean, 2016 essentially ends at Gladstone, any further north than that and it’s like I’m back on one of Kerry Packer’s cattle stations in the ’70s – 2/3”

“Far North Queensland is about as innovative as the Kodak company. They still think smoke plumes are a sign of progress. All they want to do is tear the earth open and dig up rocks – 3/3”

While being forced to take a well-earned break from referring to every person he meets as innovative, inspiring or exciting” in a constant stream of selfies – Mr Turnbull told The Advocate this morning that he did enjoy his experience’s taking part in Far North Queensland’s favourite past time.

“[Laughter] Jeez those swamp people can drink. They had Barnaby and I under the table by about midnight. It all started with a few beer samplers in Bundy before we jumped on the jet to Townsville,”

“Little did we know, the pilot had a brick of the cane cutter cordial under his seat which he sold to me and Barnaby for $170 bucks. [Laughter] It was alright though… We put that fuckin’ thing away before we landed… By that stage we were just pissed enough to blend in with the place,”

“About sixteen barbed-wire tins later and I’ve got the mayor whispering sweet nothings in my ear about a new football stadium. That’s probably the only thing that’s gonna get built in the Deep North this year. And they owe it all to Thurston [laughter].

The Prime Minister also spoke about how he was nearly assaulted when asking the owner of the Kennedy Hotel if he was interested in taking a selfie with him.

“Jeez he didn’t like that. I was all like, “ummm… ever heard of social media, mate?’ – luckily Barnaby had some cousins in the pub, or else big Mal might’ve had to have a dip,”

“Anyway, long story short, it’s a shithole of a place and I won’t be going back there for a while,”

“And when I do go back, I plan on being equally as drunk,”

Clive Palmer Admits To Wearing Lycra Activewear To Avoid Chafing Under His Suit

TEXT:

In an interview with Radio National this morning, the leader of the Palmer United Party, Clive Palmer has revealed just how he is able to continue his day-to-day business and political endeavours while wearing a suit in the blazing Canberra heat.

“It has been something I have had a lot of trial and error with,” said Clive Palmer, between mouthfuls of the Big Brekky Roll his assistant had picked up at Maple & Clove on the way to the ABC studios.

“I have spent a fair amount of my career living [puff] and working [puff] in North Queensland. As anyone who’s been up that way would know, the humidity in deep North means that stocky blokes like me are primed for a bit of chafing. Especially when we get around in suits,”

As Clive Palmer pointed out, a dark suit on a summer day can result in the most brutal upper thigh chafing for larger men of the political arena. Althought he says it isn’t something he rarely thinks about since he began wearing lycra activewear under his suit pants.

“The compression lycra really helps keeps a distance between my ‘thighceps’ [laughter]”

“I haven’t chafed down there since I first started rocking the Skins a few years back. Lazarus got me onto it when we first launched Palmer United,”

“It’s about the only decent thing that prick ever did for me,”

With a top of 36 degrees predicted in the capital this week, it seems like Clive Palmer’s wisdom may spread through the halls of Parliament house and straight under the pleated trousers of some our nation’s most portly ministers.

“I received a hand-written letter from Joe Hockey yesterday, he said despite all the headbutting – he’ll never forget what I did for him. He used to be tormented by his chafing,”

“Kim Beazley used to wear silk pantihose he borrowed from his missus,”

“It’s a tough game, thank God for Lycra.”

Cardinal George Pell considered giving up protecting child abusers for Lent

TEXT:

Australia’s most senior Roman Catholic has revealed today that he toyed with the idea of giving up protecting child predators within the church for Lent, but later reneged on the plan.

Cardinal George Pell has been under fire recently for his outright refusal to give evidence at the ongoing Royal Commission into child abuse in the Australian Catholic church.

The Vatican’s Prefect of the Secretariat for the Economy has faced some serious health problems recently, which has prevented him from travelling from his home in Italy.

But, as many big Catholics will tell you, the six-week period before Easter is called Lent – a time when you’re supposed to give up something you love doing. For some, it’s wine, chocolate or something to that effect.

For the Cardinal, he’s given up listening to Ed Sheeran’s new album until Easter, rather than going without other things he enjoys, like sheltering and harbouring disgusting human beings who prey on children.

“Yes I’ve been looking forward to Divide for what seems like forever,” laughed Pell.

“There’s nothing nefarious about that cute little redhead, though. But I love to hear him spit words and throw shade. Shame I won’t be listening to him until Easter! I’ll need all of Jesus’ love and power if I’m going to make it!”

Lucy Turnbull Shows Barnaby Around His New Living Quarters In Point Piper Boathouse

TEXT:

While the National Party prepares for the reshuffle that will follow the retirement of current leader, Warren Truss – it seems the most likely successor, Barnaby Joyce is already settling into his new role as Deputy Prime Minister Of Australia.

The Minister for New England was today shown around his new living quarters in the Prime Minister’s harbour mansion in Point Piper, by none other than the first lady, Lucy Turnbull.

“Im so stoked to try my hand at doing Deputy Prime Minister stuff” Mr Joyce told The Advocate this morning over a long black and several Winfield Reds after his grand tour of his new boathouse bedroom.

“Running the Ag stuff has been great fun but I can’t wait to weigh in on the city issues…”

“First things first, the parking in Double Bay needs to be sorted out. I’m getting stung a couple hundred each time I go down to the Royal Oak for a couple schooners… And that’s before I even get a fine! [laughter]

In footage captured by Channel Nine earlier this morning, Mr Joyce appeared to be quite excited upon inspecting the Turnbull boathouse, a residence that he will call home for the next six months – and depending on the upcoming election – another three years as well.

“Now you have a key to the upstairs house, but please make sure you text Mal before you come barging up. You never know who we might have up here.” Mrs Turnbull told the former St George tighthead prop.

The Turnbull residence is one that has hosted many other high-profile Sydneysiders before the Prime Minister purchased it in the mid-90s.

For many years, the Point Piper beachfront was home to the late socialite Klara Saunders, wife of the late Westfield Holdings director John Saunders, who in turn had bought the property from Alan Bond in 1979 for $900,000.

The Turnbull’s bought what was then a beachfront residence known as Le Gai Soleil in 1994 for $5,425,000 before commissioning a renovation shortly after, promptly dropping the Le Gai Soleil name. They then purchased the adjoining property ‘Gwandalan’ for $7.1 million in 1999.

It would seem that although he will only be staying in the waterfront boathouse, Barnaby Joyce is be the first person born west of Balmain to step foot inside the property, let alone live there.

“We did float the possibility of charging you board, but as Malcolm mentioned earlier, as long as you can keep up the maintenance of the pool area – we’d be happy to have you stay here rent-free,” said Mrs Turnbull as she opened the blinds in the soon-to-be Deputy Prime Minister new Eastern Suburbs studio apartment.

“In here is where we keep the creepy crawly for the pool. As Malcolm mentioned earlier, all you need to do with that thing is make sure you drop it in once a week. If its playing up, the numbers for the pool shop are on the bench in your kitchenette,”

“Please keep the music down in here, and if you are bringing back guests, please remember we have very important neighbours.”

While Barnaby Joyce and Malcolm Turnbull boast a close friendship, it appears the living arrangements will be based purely around business and convenience, with Mrs Turnbull outline the following house rules:

NSW Premier Live-Tweets ‘Here Come The Habibs’

NSW Premier Mike Baird is under fire today for tweeting a series of offensive ‘reviews’ about the new Channel Nine production “Here Come The Habibs” – a comedy show that shines the light on race relations in Australia.

In the barrage of tweets (which have since been deleted) Mike Baird uses the terms “Westie” and “Wog” to describe the Lebanese-Australian family at the centre of the program.

Many political commentators say this might be the slip up that exposes Baird, who up untill now had a flawless social media presence.

“I mean it isn’t like the time he live-tweeted the Bachelorette. That was all good fun and pretty harmless,” says ABC political reporter, Barry Cassidy.

“This was just flat out offensive. He must of had a few drinks or something… It is not a good look,”

“He really came off as quite a bleached-teeth Reaganist”

Baird And Scipione Reach Alcohol-Free State Of Euphoria At Mid-Week Hillsong Gathering

TEXT:

NSW Premier Mike Baird and his close friend, NSW Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione were by far among the most lively at a mid week Hillsong gathering in Baulkalm Hills last night, that’s according to the onlookers who were able to sneak a photographs of them.

It is believed Baird, who lists himself as as a devout Anglican in an attempt to appeal to his core North Shore Liberal party voters, is partial to joining the Scipione family on their Tuesday evening and Saturday morning sessions at the Hillsong church.

“It’s just great fun,” said Baird, who spoke to the ABC earlier this morning.

“I mean, this is what modern day Sydney is all about. You don’t need Alcohol to have fun,”

“And no, for the record, I wasn’t drunk in that photo… I was just in a state of euphoria from the singing and father Houston’s sermon [laughter]”

Mr Scipione, who has actually admitted to handing out bibles at the NSW Police training centre in Goulburn, also fronted the media this morning, where he told journalists that going to church is the safest way to have fun in Sydney.

“Forget nightclubs. We want our young people to stay safe – and there are no assaults in places of worship,” says Police Commissioner Scipione, who is one of the loudest supporters of Sydney’s lock-out laws.

“Well, ahhh… No violent assaults any way. None that really involved alcohol,”

When asked what other kinds of assaults who could be referring to, Mr Scipione said he was unable to comment on the happenings of a Royal Commission, but was quick to vocalise his intentions to support the lock-out laws in their upcoming review.

“Generation Y need to be more focused on buying houses, it’s a lot harder for them and they shouldn’t be spending all their money on take-away bottles of wine after 10pm,”

“They need to focus on other things, we don’t need to be dealing with them punching each other either,”

“Hillsong has been a great outlet for my kids, it really provides a great space for them to socialise and have fun without leaving the Hills District,”

“There’ll be no lock out on the timeless joy brought to the world by Jesus Christ!”

National Security No Longer At Risk As 2-Month-Old Hands Himself In To Border Force

TEXT:

The fugitive known as “Boo-boo” has today handed himself in to officers at Darwin’s Border Force headquarters, after spending more than half of his life on the run.

After arriving in Australia in late 2015 as a prenatal asylum seeker, Boo-Boo came to the attention of authorities are being officially documented in an Australian hospital, with two other illegal boat people – who were being monitored at the time for seeking mainland medical treatment for a human right that could not necessarily be afforded to them on the sweltering island detention centre of Nauru.

The party managed to avoid being transferred to Nauru after Boo-Boo was able to successfully hide in a Darwin Hospital incubator, where he managed to blend in amongst the other infant children born in Australia.

Boo-Boo, alongside the two associates who claim to be his parents, have been at the centre of a highly political and bureaucratic manhunt since his birth in mid-December.

A photo that was today tweeted by the NT Police shows Boo-Boo lying on his back in a Federal Government holding cell has been met with praise by millions, including ministers from both parties as well as xenophobic citizens who are willing to put the lives of infants at risk so that they can continue living in a contrived NewsCorp mindset of national safety.

Immigration Minister, Peter Dutton says now that Boo-Boo is in custody, Australians can finally get some sleep.

“Boo-Boo is not a modern day Ned Kelly. He is a criminal and one that we should not glamourise,”

“I mean, sure Boo-Boo is from a poor migrant family, one that has been forced into breaking the law because of an oppressive police state – and yes he has been on the run with several alleged family members who just want the best for him,”

“But he is not an Australian, like Ned Kelly was,”

“Despite the fact he was born here, in an Australian hospital… He is a threat to national security,”

Mr Dutton went on again to explain, for the second time since his appointment to the most universally hated cabinet role, that “he will not be blackmailed by human decency”

“I’ll tell you what I’ve been telling the howling apparitions that moan ‘shame’ at me during every waking hour of my existence: I will not be made to feel guilty for following the correct legal procedures.”

Boo-Boo is expected to join 37 other infant children, 160 adults, including his alleged parents, and another 50-odd older children in the boat back to the under-resourced island state. All were brought back to Australia from offshore centres, mostly for medical treatment.

Clive Palmer and Dio Wang form 2-piece blues band to sway younger voters

TEXT:

IN A POLITICAL STUNT that’s shocked Australians around the country, Clive Palmer’s latest attempt to keep his party from certain annihilation at this year’s federal election is nothing short of spectacular.

The Palmer United Blues Explosion debuted last night at Perth’s iconic Astor Theatre, with the 61-year-old fronting the two-piece band with Senator Wang on drums and backing vocals.

Playing to an oddly eager crowd in support of local heroes Eskimo Joe, who Palmer counts as a major influence on his band’s sound, Clive said that the nerves of playing an electric 50-minute set were far worse than fronting any royal commission or board meeting.

“I was just glad I didn’t break any strings this time,” said Palmer. “Dio was on fire all night, people in Canberra have started calling him Bonzo.”

Palmer says it’s what he’s always wanted to do and that it’s about getting in touch with the younger Palmer United Supporters.

“They’re the fucking future of this country,” said Clive. “They’re the future of the country’s mining sector. I fight the man, also. Young voters hate good government has much as I do.”

Although many have doubted the mining magnate penned all the songs on the duo’s upcoming LP, Get Behind Me China, Palmer has defended the often profane and insightful lyrics, saying they’re and ode to his relationship with the communist powerhouse.

“Being in a duo with Dio has only strengthened our relationship,” said Palmer.

“I thought about doing this earlier when there was four of us, back when I was listening to a lot of heavy shit. Dio was going to be my Ringo. Jacqui turned out to be my John. Glenn spent a week in India and lost his fucking mind, man. I had to kick him out.”

As for the future, Palmer thinks theres going to be a lot of movement at the station for the Blues Explosion.

His goal for this year is to headline a major Australian festival such as Bathurst’s Village Fair or perhaps even a Groovin’ the Moo tour.

“We’re just out here making good music, that’s what it’s all about,” he said. “If I can buy my way into the Senate AND the House of Reps [sic], then I’ll certainly be able to crack the Hottest 100 next year with a little tax-free donation.”

Senator Jacqui Lambie Caught On Video Fighting Over Sale Items At Kmart

Footage obtained by the Hobart Mercury earlier today shows Independent Tasmanian senator, Jacqui Lambie, involved in a physical dispute over sale items with other shoppers in a Kmart outlet in her hometown of Burnie, in the state’s north coast.

The video, which has since been removed from social media, shows Lambie grappling with several other women as she attempts to leave the store’s ‘bargain bin’ display with a highly discounted pink blouse.

The former Palmer United senator could be heard shrieking a range of lower class insults to the other shopper who had confronted her over who saw it first.

“Give it here ya dog,” screamed Ms Lambie.

“Hand it over ya dumb bitch. I seen it first ya dog”

In the two minute recording, which was filmed by shocked bystanders, Jaqui Lambie can be seen applying a ‘sleeper hold’ to another young mother, in front of her children.

“I learned this in the army. Don’t make me put ya to sleep ya mole.”

“Youse gonna hand it over or what?”

The outlets manager, Jahryleigh Tyson-Barker, spoke to The Advocate via the phone shortly after the incident.

“This isn’t the first time Jacqui’s come in here and done that,”

“Her cousins and her always come in ‘ere and fuck around during the January sales,”

“We thought she might give it a miss this year, you know with the whole Canberra thing. But she was in town, and she really wanted that top,”

A spokesperson for Senator Lambie – her 19-year-old second cousin – Jayyden Lambie says the senator makes no apologies for her behaviour earlier today and that ‘them other mob’ are just jealous because of her unusually powerful position in Australian politics.

“That bird was a Thompson. We all know that mob are fuckin’ ferals. They are just jealous and that.”

Ms Lambie is scheduled to return to Canberra tomorrow morning.

ALP Admits New Campaign Is Mostly About Finding Out Whether Bill Shorten Is Safe

TEXT:

The national president of the ALP, Mark Butler, has today confirmed that the struggling political party’s new outdoor campaign has been launched in response to growing concerns that the Australian opposition leader might have died.

“The Australian Labor Party has seen a lot of infighting amongst about whether or not we write Bill Shorten off completely,”

“A lot of people are concerned, but there’s also a lot of people who don’t give a shit if he’s alive or not,”

The new “What’s Missing” campaign was launched earlier this month in an attempt to reposition the dysfunctional political party as a fairly decent alternative to the LNP – Something they have not been able to do since John Howard refused to apologise to the Stolen Generation.

However, according to Butler, the idea to plaster Bill Shorten’s face onto cardboard milk cartons in supermarkets across the country, was mainly about figuring out whether Bill Shorten was safe. Not only as a candidate, but as a missing person.

“He’s gotta be out there somewhere… Someone has got to have seen something,”

The last confirmed sighting of Bill Shorten MP was on the lawns of Parliament House on September 14 shortly after the announcement of a second leadership spill within the Liberal Party.

“We want people to be thinking about him. If you see him, let us know,”

“Whether it’s in the polls or just a phone call, it’d be good to know where he is.”

Local Tennis Prodigy Has Too Much Ticker To Represent Australia

TEXT:

Local Australian tennis prodigy, Theo Fukinakakas (11) has been informed by the games greats that he is too much self-discipline to represent Australia.

Despite boasting an unbeaten record in state representative tennis, the South Betoota Boys High student has been shunned by both his local district as well as the greater tennis community.

Coaches, ex-players and overly protective, unfulfilled fathers all agree. The boy is too much of a good kid.

“Nah, not a chance, aye” says Ivan*, the father of a notoriously shit bloke and current Australian tennis star.

Ivan (name changed) believes that Australian tennis depends upon egotistical sociopaths who feel like they are above the law – a trait not yet present in young Theo.

“I know what you are all thinking and yes, it is true. The boy definitely has enough ‘wog’ in him,”

“But I’ve met his parents, I’ve met him. There’s too much respect there,”

“He’s not at that ‘brat’ level. He’ll never be able to generate the love/hate complex that the current pros have mastered. My son included.”

According to former piece-of-shit and relatively competitive Australian tennis veteran, Mark ‘The Scud’ Philippoussis (39), tennis in Australia has been on a gradual decline ever since the Australian Institute of Sport stopped funnelling cash into the pockets of aggressive Eastern European coaches during the lead up to the 2000 Olympics.

“Mate, in the ’90s they were throwing cash at us. It was like NASA,”

“There was no way they could have had us boys playing at home and not bringing home any medals, so they spent a lot of time and money cultivating our egos,”

“These days it pretty much comes down to whether or not the kid has come from a dysfunctional household with an abusive stage-father,”

“As far as I can see, all Theo has been exposed to is a supportive and encouraging upbringing. That’s not going to be enough… He needs to hate himself,”

Philippoussis went on to warn the nation’s hopeful parents-of-sports-stars against showing any form of ‘love’ towards their athletically gifted children. He says it gives them a false sense of security and unproductively high level of self-esteem, and that these distractive emotions are what steers away from the traditional Australian Tennis mission statement: Win, or sleep outside with the dogs tonight, you useless little cunt.

“That’s not how we breed stars in Australia. Even Lleyton was a bit of a fuckwit in his younger years,”

“The moment the Australian public began cheering for him, he stopped winning matches,”

“Call it what you will, but between the fans and Bec, there was far too much love. He didn’t hate himself enough. He began to look at alternative ways to fill the gap that had been left in his heart by the people he considered heroes,”

With the Australian Open in full-swing, it seems Australia’s ultimate no-good-cunt, Nick Kyrgios, is back to his old ways by leaving at least 80% of the tournament’s audiences praying for him to be murdered in cold blood.

Kyrgios, and his notably less-talented older brother, have spent the last few days bouncing between court side outbursts and offensive twitter tirades. Local child psychology, Bernadette Stevens, says this is a result of being raised in front of tennis ball projectiles.

“The poor young things haven’t learnt the basic social skills required to be left alone in a public place,”

“They are full blown sociopaths… Especially that brother of his,”

“Imagine being raised in your younger brother’s shadow, without any real talent of your own,”

“I wouldn’t wish it upon my son’s cruelest school bullies. Those poor boys never learnt to love.”

It Gets Worse! Turnbull Accidentally Sends Journo SMS That Was Meant For Dutton

TEXT:

Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has today admitted to accidentally sending a text message to our very own, Clancy Overell, and then proceeding to negotiate a bribe that would persuade our editor against leaking the correspondence.

I can get your Catholic children into a real private school

It is believed Turnbull’s controversial text messages were meant for the Immigration Minister, Peter Dutton. They come off the back of an extremely unprofessional and embarrassing series of gaffes by the most powerful people in our country.

The last few days have seen the intended recipient of Turnbull’s text messages, Immigration Minister Peter Dutton, being forced to apologise for also sending an offensive text message, to another journalist. It is believed that Dutton’s text message was meant for the disgraced former front bencher, Jamie Briggs.

Dutton’s text message was in reference to an article by News Limited journalist Samantha Maiden (the journalist he accidentally sent the message to) – who claimed Mr Briggs had admitted to distributing a photo he took of a female public servant after she made a complaint about his conduct during an overseas trip.

Mr Dutton‘s message described the reporter, who the SMS was mistakenly sent to, as a “mad witch”. He has since apologised.

Malcolm Turnbull has also apologised for his heavy-handed approach to dealing with Overell – the second journalist to receive an offensive text message from a member in Parliament in less than 24 hours – but not before assuring him that Betoota will be the last place in Australia to receive the NBN.

Because of this, Clancy Overell has decided to leak their entire conversation. Enjoy.

Mike Baird Promises $10Bn Waterloo Development Will Also Include Public Housing

TEXT:

The 4,000 tenants living in the iconic public housing commission (commonly known as The Towers) in the Redfern/Waterloo area of inner Sydney have been promised by Premier Mike Baird that will have the opportunity to remain in the suburb when their entire community is knocked down and rebuilt as part of plans for a new metro station in the suburb.

As a result of being pushed out of the media scrum by former Sydney University front-rowers who now work for NewsCorp, The Betoota Advocate was able to photograph NSW Premier Mike Baird from behind as he assured that residents would be guaranteed a place in the new buildings.

“Those that remain in public housing, if they want to come back to a new dwelling, they would be given that opportunity” said the young reganist as he our photographers snapped his sun-kissed office-boy fingers sternly crossed behind his back.

To cross one’s fingers is a hand gesture commonly used by mildly religious white-collar politicians. Occasionally it is interpreted as an attempt to implore God for protection. However, many Jesuits also use the gesture to excuse their telling of a white lie. By extension, a similar belief is that crossing one’s fingers invalidates a promise being made

The New South Wales Government has chosen Waterloo as the 31st Sydney metro station – an area that has famously hosted a large majority of the city’s public housing residents who face financial hardship and other socio-economic issues.

The Towers are set to be rebuilt across 17 hectares of government-owned land, which will be re-zoned and redeveloped over the next 15 to 20 years, starting in mid-2017.

With his fingers still firmly crossed, Premier Mike Baird went on to explain that tenants would be accommodated wherever possible during the transition, between nervous bursts of laughter.

“I can genuinely tell you that as we sat and looked at this, the most compelling thing for all of us was that we have an opportunity to help them,” Mr Baird said.

“I have always believed that council housing looks the same wherever you are… But it is far cheaper for us if you are in Mt Druitt [laughter],”

“But, yes… If the underclass of South Sydney insist on staying in the area purely because they want to be close to the community services that have been built around them over the last century… I guess we will look at that more closely three premiers down the track,”

“Their biggest concern, I believe, is that the residents of The Towers want to remain close to their family and the community they have grown up with,”

“If need be, we can move the lot of them out west… ”

“They can drink and yell at police offers all they like out there, no need for the elevators,”

“I don’t think any Rhode Scholars have come out of The Towers… Let alone anyone I would have met before. But if they insist then, yeah… Maybe”

The Greens urge people to stop farting in 2016

TEXT:

IT’S A LEADING cause of greenhouse emissions. Socialists moan about it all the time. Scientists have told us for years that it’s going to end up dooming the planet.

Methane occurs naturally in the environment but the overwhelming majority of it comes from deep in the bowels of livestock and people who tell other people to do their bit to help nature.

“When people pass wind, an area the size of a broadsheet is opened up in the ozone,” said Greens leader Richard Di Natale. “Next year, we’re sending out a memo to our members that they need to stop farting and listening to The Flaming Lips over a glass of chardonnay. We need to set the example.”

However, as most Australians know, some farts are simply unavoidable.

The Greens have a set of guidelines should this unimaginable scenario happen. Rather than let the fart disappear into the wind, they suggest finding a windless place – such as a car or quiet alcove, to fart into a paper bag, which can then be recycled.

“Only pass wind into a paper bag if you plan on recycling it,” said De Natale. “Brown paper takes over a week to break down. But just think how much damage you’ve done to the world already? A dozen beers a day, drizzled over turkey, ham and mince pies. You’d be able to fill up a wheat bag with fart.”

“My recycling bin is full of my farts.”

Archibald 2015: Frances Abbott Submits The First Official Portrait Of Her Father

TEXT:

A late entry into this year’s Archibald Prize has left judges stunned, as the daughter of Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott submits the first official portrait of her father.

According to the Herald, it has been revealed that the trustee board of the famous art prize made an exception to all submission deadlines, due to the young creative designer’s inability make the friday entry date.

In it’s 94th year, the Archibald Prize is touted as one of the most prestigious art prizes in the country – with approximately 800 entrants each year submitting portraits-of-photographs of B-list Australian actors, other artists, and moderately well-known Labor politicians. 

According to her Instagram page, Frances Abbott submitted the first official portrait of her father at approximately 15:00pm yesterday afternoon. At least 72 hours after entries closed to the public. Shortly after, it was revealed that the 22-year-old had been listed as a finalist.

“I am so honoured to join the ranks of Ben Quilty and Tim Storrier as a finalist in the Archibald. This has has been a dream of mine for several years now,” said an ecstatic Frances Abbott, who lists both Quilty and Storrier as inspiration, as well as 2014 finalist – Anh Do.

According to the Gallery of NSW spokesperson, Angus Capon, certain exceptions were made for Frances Abbott – due to her father’s close relationship with several members of the trustee board.

Frances Abbott, used to seeing her father in the spotlight, found herself the centre of a major news story last year when it was leaked that she had been awarded a $60,000 scholarship to study at the exclusive Whitehouse Institute of Design in 2011.

The 21-year-old student who accessed the school’s database and leaked the information to the New Matilda was handed a two-year good behaviour bond but didn’t have a conviction recorded again her name. Les Taylor, the chairman of the institute, was a long time friend and supporter of Mr Abbott.

The artistic community of Sydney is in uproar today, with many drawing parallels between the Whitehouse saga and the nepotism shown towards Frances Abbott’s Archibald submission.

Angus Capon has addressed all claims in an official press release today.

“This may look like nepotism, cronyism or even favouritism. However, it was a lovely portrait and after taking an official phone call from the Prime Minister himself, we were very excited to play host to the first official portrait of Tony Abbott,”

“She is just as credible as any other artist, in fact she has chosen the perfect subject. No one else has been able to sit down and paint Tony Abbott, so I believe she has a good chance at taking this year’s prize”,

“The subject was perfect. Topical, high-profile and able to give us media leverage – that’s really all that matters. Her style speaks for itself.”

With the likes of Anh Do (IGA Ambassador and author) Noah Taylor (Game Of Thrones actor) expected to join Ms Abbott as finalists, the pressure is on for no-name artists to deliver something that can outweigh the reputations of previous Sydney-based winners and obscure celebrities from unrelated fields.

“We are very excited to see which Channel Nine mini-series actors end up being painted. We are hoping to get the entire cast of House Husbands hung as finalists” says Mr Capon.

New documentary highlights Bill Shorten’s time as wallflower Opposition leader

TEXT:

PRIME MINISTER MALCOLM TURNBULL and his government have, in recent weeks, been openly toying with industrial relations policy, including the hot topic of penalty rates.

Coming from a background in trade unions, one would expect opposition leader Bill Shorten to have a differing opinion on the matter.

“I don’t need to tell people where I stand on matters like that,” said Shorten. “They know me. Every time the government comes out with new policy, doesn’t mean I need to call a press conference and speak on it.”

The 48-year-old is described by his party colleagues as being quiet at reserved. At the Labor Christmas party earlier this month, witnesses told the media that Shorten stood at the edge of conversations, smiling and nodding, waiting for his chance to join in. But that chance never came. Rather than join in, one guest said he awkwardly sat in the corner, playing with Penny Wong’s 4-year-old labrador.

“So what? I’m quiet,” said Shorten. “Public speaking makes me nervous. Fucking hell. I was in a trade union, so basically I’m the opposite of Malcolm Turnbull on everything. OK? Jeesus.”

Come election time next year, it’s looking more and more like a popularity vote – as opposed to one made entirely on ideology. Many rusted on Labor voters aren’t sure about Shorten, not because they don’t know where he sits on issues, but because he refuses to address them.

One life member of the CMFEU, who has a neck tattoo, said he feels sorry for Shorten.

“He’s not a bad bloke. Works hard and plays the game,” he said. “It’s just that I feel he’d be better suited in a portfolio like transport or the environmental one, where he’s not expected to do much.”

Bill Shorten Admits To Looking At Brown Cardigan While Driving

TEXT:

Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten has apologised after he was caught on camera using his phone while driving – but has made it clear that he was not texting while behind the wheel of a white four-wheel-drive in images tweeted by journalists on Thursday night.

“I know it’s not much consolation, but I want to clarify that I was NOT texting,”

“I know how dangerous texting while driving is, I never do that”

The increasingly irrelevant and frequently investigated leader of the Australian Labor Party has informed media outlets that he was in fact “browsing through the gram” when the photographs were taken.

“I was just checking out a few memes,”

“I’d been flat out that day and hadn’t had the chance to catch up on my newsfeed,”

“I don’t know if you guys know, but Brown Cardigan has been fucking red hot lately,”

The troubled MP has been praised for honesty by critics across the board with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull giving comment hours ago.

“Man, that guy’s life is just one massive R.E.M… Just eternal sadness. Good on him for being honest, though”

“I have to agree with him though, Betoota and Brown Cardigan have been spitting fire recently. Luckily I don’t to worry about being busted checking out social media while driving…”

“…That’s because I’m the Prime Minister of Australia and I have my own driver. ”

Australia’s Youngest Dinosaur Uncovered In North Sydney

TEXT:

A CHANCE DISCOVERY in a northern Sydney creek bed has been heralded by paleontologists as the natural science find of a lifetime.

As this type of dinosaur is quite rare, especially in Australia, the discovery has baffled Dr Allen Plant from the Sydney University paleontology department.

“We typically don’t see anything this ‘out of place’ in Australia. A dinosaur like this is very, very uncommon,” said Dr Plant. “Speaking from a strictly scientific point of view, the Islamoscaretoneosaurus has no business being here.”

About the same height and weight of a homo sapien, the newly named Islamoscaretoneosaurus is a reptilian creature from the late Cretaceous Period that appeared to be an omnivore. Sporting a wide mouth with early examples of incisor and molar type teeth, the Islamoscaretoneosaurus has grabbed the attention of the world’s scientific community as the fossil’s stomach contents contained only raw, unprocessed onions.

The new species is now subject to a study conducted by Dr Plant and his team at the university. Samples thought to be of the dinosaurs head and chest have been put through and MRI machine and what Plant discovered only added to the creature’s mystique.

“We’ve been able to conclude that the Islamoscaretoneosaurus was typically afraid of other dinosaurs that didn’t look like it. It was an especially pale reptile and the influx of darker meat-eating dinosaurs in the very late Cretaceous Period would’ve scared the it to death.”

Cause of Barack Obama’s constant headache discovered during MRI scan

TEXT:

AFTER INHERITING THE economic, political and foreign policy mistakes of the previous government, US President Barack Obama has revealed that since taking office, he’s been struck down by crippling migraines. Doctors at Howard University Hospital in Washington D.C. have finally been able to isolate the cause of the president’s headaches, which are clearly visible on MRI scans released by the White House today.

Since taking office, Obama has had to deal with the legacy of the Bush Administration, which takes on many forms in both Washington and abroad. Trying to govern the nation with a hostile senate, far-reaching lobby groups and a floundering economy has proven to be quite difficult for the 54-year-old Hawaiian. Speaking today from New York City, Obama said that without the efforts made by Mr Bush, his time in the top job would’ve been very different.

“The headaches started in early 2009, a few months after I won the election,” said Obama. “We were putting together our first budget. We couldn’t really do a whole lot because we’d just spent $200bn in the Middle East that year. That was when they started.”

It was just the beginning for the former civil rights attorney.

His migraines began to intensify as the United States started the elongated process of withdrawing ground forces from Iraq and Afghanistan in 2010. Both the president and the people of America hoped that this would be the end of a near decade long military and economic quagmire but it wasn’t meant to be.

“I’ve spent most of my second term in pain,” said Obama. “One thing after another. Just when I think we’ve got the money to spend on something crass like hospitals or schools, I’m having to write out a cheque so we can vaporise shit from Armenia to Zimbabwe.”

Since the War on Terror began in 2001, the collective world spend on military operations in the Middle East and Africa is in the vicinity of $2 trillion dollars. To put that figure in to perspective, former Australian prime minister Bob Hawke said during a speech to the Australia Institute last week that the mind-blowing sum would be enough to buy almost 200 billions schooners of draught beer.

“I’ll tell you something for free, 200 million schooners would do a lot more for world peace than bombs and bullets,” said the South Australian. “The only headaches I had when I was PM were from a decent Shiraz or Victoria Bitter.”

Turnbull Government Announces New Joint Cabinet Portfolio

TEXT:

The decision to create a new joint portfolio was met today after federal polling revealed 4 in 5 Australian’s found thinking about Indigenous Affairs ‘tiresome, confusing, and guilt inducing’ whereas the same number found ice cream capable of soothing those same feelings.

The Turnbull government hopes that with the joining of Indigenous Affairs with Ice Cream, Australians will find sweeping ineffectual reforms to Indigenous communities more palatable.

Stern Tutter, an academic at Monash University states that this is nothing new:

“From AO Neville handing out Bubble O’ Bills to Keating conferring a Cyclone on Eddie Mabo, ice cream has always been a major part of policy making in this area.”

Tutter goes onto cite the famous photo of Gough Whitlam pouring soil into the hand of Vincent Lingiari: “it’s a common misconception that Whitlam was pouring soil. In reality these were chocolate sprinkles, a much better ‘our bad’ than some dirt.”

Turnbull announced the new portfolio in Redfern this morning while holding a Cornetto in either hand: “Many governments have failed to ‘bridge the gap’. Well let it be known that we are the first government to fill it with a caramel centre.”

Julie Bishop reiterated the Prime Minister’s message on a trip to Darwin earlier this week: “Australians will no longer have to associate Indigenous policy making with the stolen generation, neglect, and substance abuse. Sure, those things will still be there, but they’ll be joined by strawberry sorbet, and that truly is an improvement.”

The Government hopes that the new portfolio will see Indigenous incarceration move from 1 in 4 Indigenous males behind bars, to 1 in 6 winning a free underwater camera, brought to you by PaddlePop.

Malcolm Turnbull Deals Crippling Blow to Nation’s Blacksmiths

TEXT:

Australia’s blacksmiths have voiced their displeasure with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull after he announced that he would be scrapping Tony Abbott’s controversial dames and knighthoods.

“It’s absurd,” says Yurin Blackhands, a smithy based in the Adelaide Hills, “it took me most of winter to set up my kiln. I got a prime location: just south of the crossroads, not far from the inn. Now he’s telling me my customer base no longer exists!”

Similar complaints are being made all over the country – from even as far as Melbournetown.

Moderately conservative media personality, Andrew Bolt led the charge for the now unemployed blacksmiths: “this is typical of Malcolm Turnbull and I think it’ll be typical of his government.

What you’ve got here is you’ve got men who have built fine broadswords, throwing axes, helms, shields, and halberds, and they’ve suddenly been told ‘sorry mates, go home.’ Well I think it’s mad, and I think it sums up Mr. Turnbull’s smug, left-wing attitude.”

Huster Redkilm showed the Betoota Advocate his now redundant wares: “look at this, this is a fine blade, a princely gift. This is a +2 short-sword with fire resistance. But now that there’s no knights, it’s all but worthless.”

Mr. Redkim moved his family to Canberra so that he could be closer to “the noble houses.”

The blacksmiths have joined with the Handmaiden Union, who have similarly been left shortchanged by the sudden disappearing of titles, in their case, dames.

“M’lady dust needst me to don her bonnet,” said a spokesperson, “but now me m’lady aint a lady no more and wants for nothing.”

The Prime Minister’s office has stated that it won’t respond to further criticisms of the decision or any offers of trial by combat.

Defence Force Puts Call Out For More 1980s Hunks To Help Combat ISIS

TEXT:

Australia’s Minister for Defence, the Honourable Marise Payne has announced an 11 billion dollar investment in 80s hunks as an ongoing precaution against ISIS and faltering border control.

Payne cited that the hunks will come in a range of models, mostly falling between the 1986 – 1989 make.

“It’s quite a straight forward rollout,” stated Mrs Payne,

“The ’80s hunks are perhaps the finest that have ever been,”

“They’ll be using their natural hunkiness to throw our enemies off guard, making would be terrorists and people smugglers lose confidence as the hunks swagger in with slicked back blonde tips and blue tinted aviators, projecting and aggravating cock-sure aura that will, if anything, make our opponents question their ability to win the karate tournament/dance off/arcade game play off.”

The hunks are to be equipped with ski joggles, zip-up vests, and slightly flared jeans. Each will have a Nintendo Powerglove, which is understood to be “so bad” (bad in a positive sense aka ‘sublimely radical’ or ‘full gnarly’).

Critics of the scheme have stated that the hunks will only strengthen the resolve of those that the government is aiming to defeat. They cited the high risk of terrorists and people-smugglers overcoming the odds and winning the play-offs with a rag tag team, making the hunks lose support of their lackeys, and – in a dire scenario – winning over the hunk’s hot girlfriend.  

Some high-ranking officials in the security forces have gone a step further, citing the hunk’s penchant for finding an unlikely respect for the terrorist/people smuggler, and helping them win the BMX contest at the end of the third act.

Senator Payne has reassured defence experts that these hunks are “truly insufferable pricks” and that though a few hot girlfriends can be expected to be lost, none of the hunks will defect, and will go as far as cheating if it means winning “the big trophy”.

Richie McCaw surges ahead of Tony Abbott in popularity poll

TEXT:

FOR THE FIRST time since he was ousted as prime minister, Tony Abbott has reclaimed pole position in the “most reviled public figure in Australia” poll, compiled by research group Roy Morgan.

Many media and political commentators agreed that Mr McCaw’s place at number one was only temporary, as regardless of what happens in this weekends Rugby World Cup Final, the Australian public would still have some shred of respect for what he’s achieved during his career.

The news comes after Mr Abbott delivered an anything but keynote speech at the Margaret Thatcher Lecture earlier this week, in which he implored the leaders of Europe to turn away refugees before they become a problem.

Abbott’s words drew harsh criticism as his government’s policies have no bearing or tangible relevance to the current immigration crisis rocking many European countries, but that didn’t stop him trying to impart his wisdom upon those present at the lecture.

Arguably Australia’s most openly anti-McCaw person and dedicated Wallabies fan, Robert Gumble, says that while he knows Richie McCaw is a fucking cheat and general goody-two-shoes wanker, he agrees that the departing All Blacks captain has had a positive impact on the game of rugby.

“Look, I fucking hate the bloke,” he said. “Plays the ball off the ground, comes in from the side all the time and gets away with doing it – but because he’s been able to get away with it for so long says something about the calibre of player he is. He’s obviously very good at what he does.”

However, Mr Gumble says that he’s not prepared to say the same about the former prime minister.

“He’s gone. Don’t ask me about the cunt. He should be in everyone’s collective memory by now.”

Study discovers link between gun ownership and functional illiteracy

TEXT:

A STUDY FUNDED in part by The Greens and various anti-gun groups has discovered that the inability to read and write often goes hand-in-hand with legally owning a firearm.

The report also found that people who enjoy shooting guns are twice as likely to be involved in a road rage incident and to vocally air their deep loathing of cyclists. Sadly, owners of a legally registered firearm are up to twenty times more likely to own a four-wheel-drive vehicle that never gets taken off road.

Lead researcher Liam Wasser has outlined that “there’s only one type of person who owns a registered gun”.

“These people are strange,” she said. “We don’t fully understand what makes a person want to legally own a firearm. I mean, plenty of farmers and agriculture professionals have guns but they’re intelligent enough not to register them.”

It’s true that primary producers have a legal and moral purpose to own a gun, for example, the humane destruction of livestock and for shooting feral animals. But what the study has concluded, is more and more people from the up’n’coming fringes of our capital cities are wanting to own guns, legally.

That fact has sent a shiver down the spine of Detective Superintendent Grant Stork from the Castle Hill LAC.

“Normal, literate people are typically the ones who own illegal firearms,” said Stork. “The drug trade is fuelling the gun-violence in this country, so we aim to take the guns out of the hands of these people.”

However, the 21-year veteran said that these people, who jump through the many hoops and undergo extensive background checks, just to own “a rifle that they can shoot down a range at nothing” is what alarms him.

“There’s people in the community who want a gun so bad, they subject themselves to hundreds of forms, interviews, safety and training seminars and a very, very close look through their history,” he said. “That’s what keeps me up at night.”

Content writer vaguely recalls time when he was a journalist

TEXT:

A FORMER AWARD WINNING journalist has spoken of a time, before he took a job writing mindless sponsored content for News.com.au, when he was free to pitch stories to his bosses. They’d often be shot down, either for not adhering to the company line or for just being too expensive to do. But, he says, it was a great time to be alive.

“I worked the crime beat in Sydney for years,” he said. “When I was a young fella, that is. I was basically the main reporters auxiliary – just following her around and help with photos and interviews, taking notes – you know the deal.”

But the public’s taste in news has waned from your run-of-the-mill hard news, typically written by the young staff writers at a major daily, to the in-depth analysis provided by the more stately reporters in the ranks. What its waned to is truely horrifying.

“This morning, I pitched my editor a story idea. I want to head out on the road for a while and get a good handle of this developing murder case, the one you’ve probably heard about in the news recently,” he said. “While they admired my dedication to the craft, my editor told me that people don’t want to read about that kind of stuff anymore.”

He was then told to walk downstairs to the media room on the second floor, put on a set of cheap headphones and take notes on the season finale of The Bachelorette.  It’s something he never envisaged doing all those years ago as a young cadet walking the mean streets of Cabramatta.

“As much as I HATE writing this bullshit, it pays the bills,” he said. “But look, I’ve got responsibilities to look after now. My wife is pregnant with our first kid, interest rates have just gone up and my car needs new tires to pass rego – if that means I have to be a pretend journalist, then so be it.”

Peter Dutton: “I Will Not Be Blackmailed By Human Decency”

TEXT:

Immigration Minister Peter Dutton stated on Radio National this morning that he would not be “blackmailed by human decency,” 

Mr Dutton was responding to the claims of self harm and detiorating mental health of children in Nauru, made by 4Corners last night.

While addressing the Opposition in question time, the Minister conceded that “Referring to this people as ‘children’ was the only mistake I have made – that’s the closest I’ve come to endangering our bipartisan attempts to dehumanise them in a way that would render their lives of very little importance,”

“Listen,” said the Minister to the press gallery, “I’ll tell you what I’ve been telling those three ghosts that visit me every Christmas and the howling apparitions that moan ‘shame’ at me during every waking hour of my existence: I will not be made to feel guilty for following the correct legal procedures.”

The Minister, who was recently led by a floating dagger towards then Prime Minister Tony Abbott’s sleeping quarters, has claimed any attempt to “move him from the fiery path to hell by soothsayers, witches, blind hermits, disembodied voices, or astral projections of his dead ancestors will be “justifiably ignored” and that he refuses to “heed  their warnings of his innate moral turpitude contributing to the slow disintegration of modern Australian society.”

“Operation Border Force did a great job last week intercepting the illegal importation of over 20 million cigarettes,” reiterated Dutton on the ABC “Do you know how evil cigarettes are? Isn’t that enough good to stop blood coming out of my taps every morning?”

The Minister went onto claim that nightly visitations from a weeping Christ are “typical” of the ABC’s portrayal of last week’s events.

The Minister concluded his criticism of the ongoing scrutiny, stating that: “I’ve got one word for the skies turning a curdling crimson and clouds coming together to form an unending army of undead weeping refugee children – petty.”

Former PM Abbott Pens Heartfelt Open Letter To His Supporters

TEXT:

Former Prime Minister Tony Abbott has today come forward publicly, for the first time since his leadership spill, with an emotional tribute to his family, supporters and colleagues.

This comes in the shape of an open letter, penned by Mr Abbott, as he and his family prepare for a life void of scrutiny – commuting between Forestville in his home electorate and Canberra – where he now sits three rows from the front in Parliament House.

Intercepted via News.com.au, the letter also adds speculation to rumours that suggest Tony Abbott may be making a move towards column-writing for NewsLimited, where he would be joining the likes of Andrew Bolt and Miranda Devine as the “more moderate” voice in their stable of opinions.

While the open letter does a good job of explaining Mr Abbott’s current head space for all those concerned, it also presents itself as a way for Mr Abbott to clean his slate… and more importantly, wash his hands.

The former Minister For Woman has surprised political commentators with his heavy focus on human rights violations in off-shore detention. An issue he says was gravely misunderstood by his government and something he regrets.

Former Prime Minister Abbott’s letter reads:

“I find it shameful how ignorant most Australians are in regards to our immigration policy. Most turn a blind eye to the human rights abuses committed by successive Governments, and have little to no idea of the statistics surrounding refugees, let alone the reasons for their exodus.

However I must confess that it is hypocritical of me to lecture anyone on the refugee issue, as I truly believed that ‘boat people’ were foreign monsters from the blood-stained plains of the endless war.

This misconception arose from a misunderstanding of the phrase ‘boat people’ and what it truly referred to.

Like many Australians, I found the invasion of ‘boat people’ terrifying.

This was mainly because I pictured ‘boat people’ as great hulking beasts, monstrous diesel spewing giants, with propellers for tails and rudders running up their spines, smoke stacks rising from their shoulders and heads like great demonic horns, huge webbed wings made of sails, and steering wheels for nipples.

Any reasonable person would be mortified by such a monster, and I more than anyone I knew, passionately argued that they should be killed, or at least detained on some great fortress archipelago in the Micronesian phosphate colony of Nauru.

When people spoke to me of ‘boat people’ swallowing razorblades and waving protest signs on the roof of a demountable I thought they were mad. “Swallowing a razor would be nothing to such a mighty beast!” I’d retort, and “a small demountable would be crushed into dust and rubble under the sheer might of such a daemon!”

It is only since I found myself relocated to the backbench of Federal Parliament that I realised that ‘boat people’ were not Titan-like Goliaths, but refugees. And very vulnerable refugees at that.

I made this discovery after accidentally reading The Sydney Morning Herald while staying the weekend at my cousin’s Western-Style guest cottage in Petersham.

Never have I been as relieved and confused as I was in that moment of realisation. This lady who has been ping-ponged back and forth from detention while carrying the unwanted child of a rapist, is in fact not a half-human/half-machine robot – but a scared Somalian Asylum seeker.

A young woman who has fallen victim to one of societies lowest predators.

So I implore people to stop using the phrase ‘boat people’ and stick with the much simpler ‘refugee’ for fear that there is more people like me out there mistaking the former as terrifying monsters.

As far as I now know, there are no continent-hopping titans intent on obliterating government house with their whirring propeller tails.

That leaves us only with the mysterious omnipotent ‘Death Cult’, which steals baby faced teens and transforms them into Vampyric undead shadow-warriors. But that’s a not a problem in our backyard, yet.

And when it does become one. It will be a problem for Mr Turnbull.

Don’t give up on me. I’ll be back.

Your mate, Tone.”

Latham coins the term “feral media” while appearing on epitome of feral media

TEXT:

With topics like What can our politicians learn from Trump?  and Is the community over-diagnosing mental illness? – Channel Nine has delivered a Logie-baiting panel show that combines the sophistication of Q&A with the cheeky wit of the NRL Footy Show. We can tell already, The Verdict is going to be great for ratings.

With usually inaccessible talent like Mark Latham, Jacquie Lambie and former Gold Coast Suns AFL footballer Campbell Brown – It’s no wonder that none of the guests ended up finishing any of their sentences.

As well as bouncing between dismissively critical rants about Australia’s mental health problem and what seemed to be a mutual group appreciation of “The Donald” – The panel also touched on “Sydney’s Muslim Problem” and whether or not football stars that have been convicted of domestic violence should be able to play again.

One term that kept recurring throughout the program was former Labor party-leader-turned-outspoken-misogynist Mark Latham’s favourite new expression: “Feral Media”.

“Donald Trump is great, he knows how to deal with the feral media,”

“Tony Abbott was a victim of the feral media,”

“Sportstars who assault their wives are constantly crucified by the feral media”

“When will we learn that the feral media is responsible for climate change”

“Feral media is responsible for marriage inequality, and feral media”

“Feral Media is a direct result of the feral media”

However, with an array of topical and heavily politicized subjects, The Verdict has also been blasted for their “Newscorp-style” rage-bait. Many people have suggested that The Verdict is itself, the epitome of “feral media”.

Channel Nine CEO Daniel Grinkel has come out in defence of the program.

“Nah it’s all good,” he said

“We have done the research. These are the topics that matter the most to Aussies,”

“Sports, Muslims, scary illnesses… the big issues that Q&A won’t go near,”

“I reckon next week we’ll get Karl to go harder on domestic violence… It’d be great to get Latham one on one with an actual victim,”

PRIME MINISTER MALCOLM Turnbull’s Point Piper manor is set to star on the US-reality TV show “MTV Cribs” after news he turned down Kirribilli House, arguably the most desirable harbourside address, for his own home. Valued at close to $50m, Turnbull’s house boasts some of the most obscure and extravagant features that set it apart from any other house in the country.

From the indoor go kart track to the pool bar, the 60-year-old’s “crib” makes a trade union luncheon look like a meal sitting on your bonnet in McDonalds carpark. The property is also home to the only stables in the Point Piper area. Mr Turnbull owns four horses that he keeps in the stables but he doesn’t know their names.

“The yardstick by which to measure a man’s success shouldn’t be the length of his yacht, but by the number of horses he keeps but never rides,” said Turnbull. “They’re ornamental horses. They spook easy. Whenever I have Ricky Muir over to talk Syria and have a go kart, they go apeshit and neigh all night.”

Turnbull’s indoor go kart track has been the scene of many heated contests over the years, one notable incident being the time Kim Beazley accidentally ran over Peter Beattie’s dog, Tim Tam, paralysing it from the waist down.

A little known hobby of the once Rhodes Scholar is music. The home has a recording studio, where Turnbull experiments with both contemporary and more classical genres of music. The Betoota Advocate can reveal that the prime minister is one of the nation’s most endearing vaporwave composers, a type of music enjoyed by almost nobody.

The squash court has caused less drama for the PM, as it gets rarely used anymore. Although prior to former state minister Joe Tripodi tearing his ACL after slipping over in a pool of Shane Warne’s sweat, it was used every other Sunday by some of the most influential people in the country – including entrepreneur and serial prankster Dick Smith, who famously swapped the squash ball for a golf ball. Smith’s prank caused a significant amount of damage to Turnbull’s court and the ricocheting golf ball ended up hitting Molly Meldrum in the throat, some 20 metres away from the arena.

Local real estate agents have described the Turnbull compound as priceless, leaving little wonder why he chose to stay at home.

Australian Gun Laws Blamed For Concerning Rise In Sternly-Worded Letters

TEXT:

THE AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE have today commented on what the Daily Telegraph has described as a “national embarrassment”.

Australia’s dramatic rise in sternly-worded letters.

“Australians represent one of the largest contributors to sternly-written letters in the developed world,” said high-ranking AFP official, Doug Hole

“Out of the 18 million stern letters received globally in 2014, Australia was responsible for at least eight million of them,”

“These letters range from your run-of-the-mill customer complaints, passively aggressive thank-you letters to drunken wedding guests and, of course, half-hearted death threats to ex-lovers and their partners”

Sergeant Hole went on to explain that these endemic rates of stroppy correspondence is a direct result of the Howard Government’s National Gun Buy-Back scheme in 1996, and the subsequent legislation regarding gun ownership to be put in place since then.

“From the moment high-powered machine guns were regulated, we have seen a concerning jump in the rates of Australians venting through the power of the pen,”

“It is a concern, yes. One that proves very testing for our nation’s Human Resources sector,”

The Betoota Advocate spoke with Monash University professor, Dr Eileen Dover about this issue. She says it’s a discussion Australia is not yet ready to have.

“Once upon a time, middle-class Australians were able to deal with their angst, frustrations and crippling mental derangements in a much more efficient manner,”

“That being, the act of purchasing a firearm at their local hunting store, and then, pending on background checks, firing it at innocent people before turning it on themselves,”

“Howard has dramatically changed the way our most sociopathic citizens communicate,”

“Gone are the days where they were able to get sufficient attention by simply walking into a department store or playground. They are now left to deal with a web of consumer relations bureaucrats,”

Dr Dover went on to explain that mentally ill firearm enthusiasts should not have to pay for the actions of one overly-enthusiastic firearm owner in 1996.

Bob Katter Crowns Thurston “King Of The North” In Emotional Send-Off

TEXT:

Cowboys superstar Johnathan Thurston has been crowned “King Of The North” in a sacred North Queensland ceremony yesterday morning.

Wearing his iconic blue and yellow headgear, the small-town hero was blessed by none other than Northern Australian MP, Bob Katter, in front of over ten thousand screaming fans outside of the Townsville airport.

On a red carpet rolled out specifically for the royalty, Mr Katter placed the blade a sword on the shoulder of a kneeling JT. Surrounded by high-ranking North Queensland nobility, he began the service.

“Johnathon Dean Thurston, Son of Graham,” boomed Mr Katter.

“You stand before me as well-noted contributor to community, camaraderie and the greatest game of all. Rugby league football,”

“Through powers vested in me by the republic of North Queensland, I now crown you King Of The North,”

The ten-thousand strong gathering of emotional sunk-kissed working class supporters sat still, in response to the majestic exchange.

“Now go and give it to those bastards from Brisbane!” Katter roared, as the airport PA system began blaring American Kid Rock’s iconic sing-along anthem, They call me cowboy.

The highest honour for any civilian resident north of Gladstone, it is believed that Mr Katter had sought to bestow the title to Thurston in 2013, following a match-winning performance that sealed eight consecutive State Of Origin series win for Queensland.

The North Queensland Cowboys are currently in the hostile state of New South Wales, as they prepare to win their first NRL premiership.

The Cowboys team bus took to the streets of Townsville for an early morning farewell tour past waving fans before the players were cheered by hundreds more at the airport ahead of their flight to Sydney.

“It’s too deadly! To be given this title only days before the big match, It’s a real honour” said an emotional Thurston.

“We thought there’d be a big turnout, but it still surprised a few of the guys.”

“Mr Katter knows I wear this with pride, and I have informed him that when we return home with The Trophy, the first thing we will be doing is joining him on his push for succession,”

“North Queensland is not just different state. It’s a different country. Now watch these Cowboys break in a few Broncs”

The huge farewell was in contrast to the handful of fans at Brisbane airport a day earlier as the Broncos snuck away quietly to prepare for Sunday’s grand final clash at Sydney’s Olympic stadium on Sunday.

Mike Baird Leads Polls After Rescuing Adorable Kittens From House Fire

TEXT:

New South Wales Liberal Premier Mike Baird has maintained significant advantages over the opposition, according to the latest state-based Morgan polls.

Political commentators put this surge in popularity down to the 47-year-old’s calculated responses to shark attacks, refugee resettlement and The Bachelor Finale. It is also believed that Baird is being aided by the fact that he rescued up to six adorable little kittens from a blazing house fire in a low socio-economic western Sydney suburb yesterday afternoon.

In NSW, Mr Baird’s Liberal-National Party Coalition government hold a 102 per cent lead over Labor in the two-party-preferred poll, a lead that become evident after the technologically-literate, good Christian boy from the Northern Beaches live-tweeted Channel Ten’s final episode of The Bachelor, to the delight of every unmarried Australian woman over the age of 23.

Newspoll statisticians have cited a “small margin of error” which would explain Baird being 2% more popular than the survey could have possibly allowed.

However, Channel Ten’s political juggernaut Andrew Bolt says this number makes perfect sense, and that it won’t be a surprise if the state is 110% behind Mike Baird in the next election.

“Look, he’s pretty unstoppable at the moment. He’s social media game is straight fire and he is a real communicator,” said Mr Bolt, who went on to explain that the Premier is at a point of his career where he could literally do anything he wanted.

“Legalizing cannabis will be a walk in the park for this bloke… If Mike Baird proposed a Whites Only Beach, he would probably be able to pull it off right now,”

“That whole house fire thing in Cabramatta yesterday was unbelievable. His timing was impeccable, and the fact that he gave those cute little kittens mouth-to-mouth… Well he’s just nailed the Asian vote,”

It is believed that Baird was visiting South-West Sydney yesterday to source out the best Vietnamese beef noodle soup for his online food blog, only to accidentally arrive at the scene of a suburban house fire.

After rescuing seven at-risk Indigenous and Muslim orphans from the first floor, Baird navigated his way through the flames to save six howling kittens sitting a second-story windowsill.

He then proceeded to successfully resuscitate both the children and the kittens on the front lawn, with CPR skills he picked up as volunteer surf lifesaver in Sydney’s Northern Beaches.

One observer says if Mike Baird wasn’t there, everyone would have died. Including the cats.

“When our Premier arrived, the firefighters who were already on the scene put down their tools to get an autograph. We nearly lost them all,” says local man Ken Hua.

“Luckily Baird was able to communicate that he was happy to stick around for autographs and selfies after they had finished helping him rescue the children and kittens,”

“He really showed some true leadership,”

The LNP leads strongly in NSW: LNP 102% cf. ALP 0%

Tony Abbott might “head up north” on a Betoota gap year in 2016

TEXT:

LIKE MANY DIRECTIONLESS young people, former PM Tony Abbott is considering taking an extended break, or a “gap year” on a working cattle station in northern Australia. His former friend turned casual acquaintance James Packer did something similar when he was 19, as his father Kerry sent him “up north” for being an entitled little private school cunt – something he hoped the Territory would straighten out. And it did.

After being publically embarrassed and had his life’s work dragged through the mud, Tony Abbott says he needs a fresh start.

“Look, I, ah, don’t really know where to start,” said Mr Abbott from his peasant-style brick home on Sydney’s upper north shore. “I’m looking at heading up to the gulf country, maybe even the Kimberly. Who knows at this stage. All I know is that I can’t stay at home – it’s driving me up the wall.”

Local pastoralist Jack Pearson from E.H. Pearson Cattle Company says he’d give the former politician a job, provided he wasn’t a “hopeless, dough-banging soft cock” like most New South Welshmen are.

“I’d give him a go, I give everybody a go,” said Mr Pearson. “But listen, joog. I’d let that bastard know directly if he was pulling his weight. By God I would bunge.”

In 2009, the Australian Bureau of Statistics found that 1 in 4 Australians is friendly with a person from Sydney’s North Shore that claims to know how to ride a horse. As Mr Abbott falls into that category, he’s already informed his prospective employers that he can handle any horse – from a wild Channel Country brumby to a Carlton United Clydesdale.

Mr Abbott knows full well that wearing a helmet while riding a horse on a cattle station is social suicide.

“Real cowboys don’t wear helmets, they wear hats,” said Abbott.

“Christopher Pine is the type of bloke who’d wear a helmet on a horse.”

Malcolm Turnbull Rejects His Liberal Slave Name

TEXT:

Former Minister of Communications minister and Prime Minister-elect, Malcolm Turnbull, has told ABC 24 this morning that he will no longer acknowledge his own last name.

The self-made-millionaire Member for Wentworth believes that his own last name had “been whipped, tarnished and exploited” by an overbearing master to the point where it no longer means anything to anyone. Including him.

Now going by the his new, self-given name of Malcolm X, the staunch republican and political journeyman has told reporters that “his people” have for too long been exploited by the likes of former-Prime Minister Abbott.

“The real names of our people [Moderate Liberal politicians] were destroyed during the Abbott Governent. The last name of my forefathers was taken from me when I was brought to Canberra, and then the name of the slave master was given to us all, which we refuse, we reject that name today and refuse it. I will never acknowledge it whatsoever,”

When asked whether he might be taking his re-brand of the Australian Liberal Party a step too far, Mr X responded venomously.

“For too long the name Malcolm Turnbull meant “Abbott’s boy” – This is no longer the case. I am not a House Liberal, I am a Field Liberal. I am Malcolm X”

“Our previous names now have no value. With our master overthrown we are able to rise up. As our own selves,”

“We declare our right on this earth…to be a human being, to be respected as a human being, to be given the rights of a human being in this society, on this earth, in this day, which we intend to bring into existence by any means necessary.”

It remains to be seen whether or not Malcolm X, Julie X and Wyatt Y will officially undergo the process of legal name changes, but it is not the most bizarre news story in relation to the new leadership, which has not yet seen an entire working day.

Last night Prime Minister X drew criticism for live-tweeting the entire Liberal leadership challenge from inside the House of Representatives.

With much more important hurdles ahead of him, political commentators such as esteemed Daily Telegraph Columnist Joe Hildebrand have questioned whether name-changes are the most important issues right now.

“He’s got better things to do right now,” says Hildebrand.

“The first thing I’d be doing is moving into that lodge which Abbott spent $8.8 million renovating, only to never step foot inside,”

“I’d be dying to wear in that gorgeous Catholic burgundy carpet.”

Bill Shorten’s Office Found Empty Following #LibSpill Announcement

TEXT:

ABC reporters have been unable to locate the whereabouts of Opposition Leader, Bill Shorten MP, following the announcement of Liberal Party leaderships challenge.

Moments ago, Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull announced to the world that he was challenging Prime Minister Tony Abbott’s role as leader of Liberal Party, an announcement that many feel has crippled Shorten’s chances of ever doing so himself.

ABC Reporter Eliza Borrello was first on the scene.

“It looks like Mr Shorten has taken this news quite poorly,”

“There is a fist-shaped hole in his laptop screen and just about every piece of furniture has been smashed against his bookshelves,”

“There is blood smeared across the walls which would suggest he has lacerated his hands in the process,”

Mr Shorten was not at the scene, but ABC reporter have received word from ALP staffers that he is unable to give comment at this time.

The Betoota Advocate will continue to seek comment from Mr Shorten. However this may prove difficult as we were denied entry to the Canberra Press Gallery during the last #LibSpill.

POWER COUPLE: Senator Lambie and Senator Xenophon are official!

TEXT:

According to insiders, two of the country’s highest profile federal senators Jaqui Lambie and Nick Xenophon are official!

This news comes alongside news that the two have forged a political alliance in an attempt to win more seats at the next election.

Sources close to both parties have confirmed that Nick Xenophon secured the heart of Tasmanian senator following a visit to the north-west of her state last week, where he is believed to have asked the young mother to dinner at a local Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant.

Prior to her budding companionship with the avid non-gambling Greek, Lambie has previously been linked to NRL Footy Show host Beau Ryan and The Betoota Advocate’s very own editor, Clancy Overell.

“Jacqui was never going to settle down with a quiet old bushie like me,” said a jaded Overell.

“She was caught up in that Canberra fast lane. The dinners, the public bar, Katter’s Karaoke. We really tried to make it work, but I have a feeling Xenophon has been cutting my grass for a while,”

Speaking from his South Australian home, Nick Xenophon was unable to confirm the claims of an affair with Ms Lambie, but he has stated that if he receives anymore late night phone calls from the Betoota Hotel’s landline – he will be slapping Clancy Overell with an Apprehended Violence Order (AVO).

“I don’t appreciate the late night phone calls. No wonder you louts were denied Press Gallery access,” said Xenophon

“There is nothing that suggests Lambchop (Senator Jacqui Lambie) and I are romantically involved with one another… Other than the photo of us at KFC in Tassie,” said a defensive Xenophon.

“I don’t think that warrants the drunken threats I have been receiving from The Betoota Advocate’s editor,”

In what can only be described as a blatant example of mixing business with pleasure, both senators recently created their own political parties, the Nick Xenophon Team and the Jacqui Lambie Network – forging a political alliance in an attempt to win more seats at the next election.

Australian Schools To Continue Showing Film About Child With Two Dads

TEXT:

An explicit film that was directed and produced by one of Australia’s most controversial filmmakers has been given the all clear to continue being shown during school hours, despite homoerotic themes and a blatant pro-same-sex parenting agenda.

Federal Minister for Education, Christopher Pyne has spoken to The Betoota Advocate today, about why the 2004 epic biblical drama film, The Passion Of The Christ, is important viewing for Australian students.

“It’s a film that our Government feels is very relevant to our young nation,”

“A groundbreaking film about a community of sun-fearing peasants that lived in the Middle-East over two thousand years ago. [Prime Minister Abbott] is a big fan of this story,”

“It’s already being shown in most progressive Catholic schools, but ideally we would like to see this story shared with every student in every school around the country,”

However, the film has also been criticized for it’s glamourization of same-sex parenting and its extremely violent ending.

Liberal Senator, Cory Bernardi spoke to the Daily Telegraph this morning, about the need for this film to be banished from all high-schools around the country.

“I’ve seen the film, it’s sickening,” said the author of Australia’s first ever political manifesto, The Conservative Revolution.

“It’s a film about a carpenter named Joe who is pressured into raising a son with another man,”

“The whole story pretty much consists of Joe telling the other bloke how much he loves him,”

“The film doesn’t seem to draw correlations between same-sex parenting and the fact that their son ended up being arrested and executed after a lifelong opposition to authority figures,”

“The kid was not raised in a healthy environment, he ended up living with twelve blokes who were all in love with him… At least they kept telling him that,”

“It is a very homoerotic story, and it’s not safe to be showing it to kids. We want safer schools not gay and confused schools”

This film follow the 2014 drama that saw the NSW education department demand that schools stop showing Gayby Baby, a documentary about same-sex parenting, during school hours.

The decision came after media reports that parents from a range Sydney high schools were upset that the film would be forced down their children’s throats.

Gayby Baby, directed by Maya Newell, follows four children raised by same-sex parents. The Daily Telegraph reported yesterday that the most important lobby group in the country, the parents of high schoolers, had complained after the north-west Sydney school principal announced the screening, saying.

Mike Baird is yet to comment on whether or not The Passion Of The Christ will also be banned in NSW schools, but it is expected any state government that pushes to have this story removed from school curriculums will be met with backlash from Fred Nile.

David Leyonhjelm enjoyed a cigarette in the Senate this afternoon

TEXT:

AUSTRALIA’S FIRST OPENLY libertarian politician smoked a cigarette in parliament today, stating that he should be able to do so.

Senator David Leyonhjelm says the laws that prohibit smoking in public buildings are just another example of how frivolous government legislation is keeping the people in shackles.

“There shouldn’t be a law that says I can’t enjoy a Peter Stuyvesant whenever I want,” said the former agribusinessmen.

“In fact, I should be able to sit wherever I want in the Senate. We should scrap the seating plan, this isn’t year nine geography,”

“It’s a personal decision and freedom to smoke, so why should we try to govern that?”

Smoking was banned inside Parliament House in 1994 after then finance minister Kim Beazley was caught putting out a cigarette on the carpet for the third time.

However, this is not the first measure Senator Leyonhjelm has fought against in Parliament House.

Earlier this year, he tried to introduce a plan to sell the naming rights to the iconic Canberra building to a brewery, which would’ve seen Parliament House renamed.

The proposed names included The China Air Southern Parliament Complex™ and Bunnings™ Law House but the plan was quickly shot down by his colleagues.

“That’s more evidence to prove that the government is interfering too much in its own affairs,” said Leyonhjelm.

“No matter what the government tries to do, my dream of an open-based society founded upon economic and personal freedoms will never be extinguished.”

Royal Commissioner Dyson Heydon To Be Replaced By Dyson Airblade™

TEXT:

Prime Minister Abbott has announced a “hygienic compromise” today after Labor’s insistence that Royal Commissioner Dyson Heydon should resign or be dismissed from the inquiry into trade unions, following the revelation that he had booked to speak at a fundraiser in support of the NSW Liberal Party.

The Federal Government has made its position clear, The Royal Commission into Trade Union governance and Corruption will continue under a new Royal Commissioner: The Dyson Airblade™.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott was unequivocal when he said that Heydon’s performance in his role had been “absolutely beyond reproach” – But was unfortunately a victim of his own social status.

“Yeah, he probably shouldn’t have been so blatant about getting in bed with us. Probably didn’t need to RSVP to that event… Godammit Baird,”

“Our new Commissioner is a hygienic compromise for all involved. An apolitical innovation in the world of Union sanitisation, one that will be able to finish the job on this mess,”

“The Dyson Airblade™ will ensure that no hands are dirty at the end of this”

Education Minister Christopher Pyne said Labor was “bashing the umpire” in order to escape political damage from the inquiry – but was optimistic about the future of the Royal Commission now that it will be headed by the golden child of British vacuum magnate Sir James Dyson.

“I am a big fan of the new Royal Commissioner. I believe The Airblade™ will be efficient and indifferent to those who stand before it,”

Whether it’s former Labor leaders or your run-of-the-mill bikie-affiliated union thug. No one gets past the Airblade,”

“It’s practice is world renowned, as is the Airblade’s class and dry sense of humour”

“The Dyson Airblade™ can’t be greased. It might sound like hot air, but I think we will benefit from the hands-on approach”

Government says waterboarding at Nauru sounds like ‘something cool teenagers do on holiday’

TEXT:

A spokesman for Immigration Minister Peter Dutton says claims that asylum seekers at Nauru detention centre were water-boarded were “down right incorrect” and “false”.

The government has explained that the guard at the centre of the waterboarding allegations got his aquatic-boardsport terminology mixed up.

In a report published by the Abbott Government earlier this week, sources on Nauru said that children from the detention centre were given wakeboarding lessons during their stay on the island – some were forced to take part, even when they told instructors they couldn’t swim.

Speaking today from his North Brisbane home, Peter Dutton said that the children were wakeboarded  because it would help them assimilate.

“These refugees, should they prove to be genuine ones, will one day have to assimilate fully into the Australian way of life,” said Dutton.

“We wakeboarded those children because the areas we’re planning to settle these people has a higher-than-average concentration of high-income-earning-working-class. Or as the Greens call them, cashed up bogans. Every Australian knows that the cashed up bogan loves to wakeboard so we only thought it natural do give these Afghani kids a fighting chance at being normal,”

“If only they knew what we are trying to do for them.”

Opposition leader Bill Shorten surprisingly broke his silence on the immigration issue this morning, saying that it was a “rampant injustice that these refugees were not forced to have motocross lessons, in addition to the wakeboarding”.

He said that some of these refugee families could be settled in a regional area, far away from any wakeboardable water body.

“Refugees should be made to learn how to ride a motorbike, just in case they end up in the bush,” he said.

“And not a four-wheeled one either. A real one. If Labor is elected next year, I promise to set aside $24m to buy motorbikes for refugees. We aren’t afraid to spend money on dumb shit, either,”

“I’m committed to seeing cashed up bogans in the bush be treated the same as their city cousins. And refugees.” he said.

A private security firm has been tasked with running the Nauru Regional Processing Centre since 2012, with most of their current staff coming from a strong cashed up bogan background.

Security consultant and Nauru HR manager Kane Karter-Knowles says that the multi-national security firm likes to hire Australians from communities where refugees would likely end up if their asylum claims are verified as genuine.

“We like to hire from iconic Australian localities like the Central Coast in NSW and the Sunshine Coast in the tropical state,” he said.

“That way, these refugees get to experience what life would be like in a community such as the Central Coast – before they actually arrived there,”

“Just read the news articles and NGO reports, you’ll find that I’m not lying.”

Tony Abbott’s Gay Friends Understand That This Wasn’t Directed At Them

TEXT:

After nearly six hours of debate yesterday, the Coalition party room voted not to allow a conscience vote, instead binding MPs to support traditional marriage.

However, it appears Prime Minister Abbott is concerned he may have put a few lifelong friends off-side with the decision, and has spent the last twelve hours making amends with his gay associates.

“I want all my gay friends and family to know, that this was not directed at them,” Mr Abbott said on Studio 10 this morning.

I am not denying gay people the right to be in gay relationships… I am just denying them the right to live in a country that acknowledges the legitimacy of gay relationships,”

Mark Pearson, a close friends of the Abbott family and a proud homosexual man, says he understands that Mr Abbott didn’t mean to offend when peer-pressured an entire political party to pretend he and is partner of 35-years are no more than “housemates”.

“I know what Tony’s like… He sometimes struggles to say what he means,” says Mr Pearson.

“I think what he was trying to say is that the whole idea of marriage isn’t meant to include me and my partner. Despite the fact that we own a house together, are in the process of adopting a child together, and have been planning our wedding since we made a civil promise to spend the rest of our lives together,”

“It’s just so Tony, he really is trying his best”

Despite a heroes homecoming in the suburban metropolis of upper-north-shore Sydney this morning, it is understood that Prime Minister Abbott is very aware that his close friends and family might have a problem with last night’s decision.

“My sister is going to kill me!” laughed Abbott.

“[Laughter] We always used to joke about how she was going to end up as an unmarried spinster. I guess I’m not helping things! [Laughter]”

Is Malcolm Turnbull the only MP who can afford the Speaker lifestyle?

TEXT:

HE’S THE ONLY Member of Parliament to make the BRW Rich List.

With an estimated net worth of around AU$200 million, Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull may be forced into a political role he never wanted.

The harsh reality that Mr Turnbull is facing right now is that he’s the only representative who can afford to be Speaker of the House.

If Malcolm Turnbull does become Australia’s next prime minister, he’ll be getting the raw prawn if he decides to move into The Lodge.

Like so many Australians, the wealthiest member of federal parliament has much of his money tied up in his castle, which in his case is a waterfront estate in Point Piper on a scale and grandeur similar to the nearby mansion Altona which sold for $52 million.

Compare that with the funnel-web infested hell-hole in Davidson, just a grueling hours drive north, where the prime minister calls home while in Sydney.

Three weeks ago, former Speaker Brownyn Bishop had her political career all but ended by a whopping error in judgement. She spent $5000 of party money on a chartered helicopter ride to a Liberal fundraiser.

For Malcolm Turnbull, he could drop that on lunch and still leave a good tip.

It also emerged that Mrs Bishop spent $90,000 of taxpayer cash on a European trip partly aimed at an attempt to secure her a plum new job abroad – a sum slightly less than what the communications minister spent last year on merlot.

Betoota’s local member Bruce Scott will resume his duties as deputy speaker when parliament resumes on Monday but he’s due to retire at the next election, which couldn’t come a moment too soon for the inner-city socialists who have trouble understanding Mr Scott when he speaks in his raspy western division drawl.

The Roma-born parliamentarian is reported so difficult to understand for some Greens and Labor MPs that a translator from Toowoomba has been called in to act as an interpreter.

But it would be the only way for Tony Abbott to safeguard his position as prime minister because Mr Turnbull is the only viable alternative. Being Speaker would all but end Turnbull’s quest to be the leader of this great Commonwealth.

Tyler, The Creator banned from entering Australia – government urges public to support local acts

TEXT:

IMMIGRATION MINISTER PETER Dutton has confirmed that US rapper Tyler, The Creator has been banned from entering the country.

The decision was handed down this morning after the government agreed that the 24-year-old “was not of good character” and potentially harmful.

While many speculated that the controversial artist was barred from entering the country after his lengthy battle with paramilitary feminist group Collective Shout – but the immigration minister said that he made the decision to ban Mr Creator because “there are plenty of perfectly fine and wholesome Australian hip-hop artists that deserve a fair go”.

The news has sent shockwaves through the Australian hip-hop or ‘skip-hop’ scene.

In addition to the federal government’s ruling, Aussie MCs are now allowed to use the n-word freely and spit rhymes about killing other n-words. However, rapping about homosexual marriage or human rights is still covered by a blanket ban.

Speaking this morning from Canberra, Peter Dutton said he was looking forward to hearing more homegrown rap and less whinging from feminists.

“It wasn’t an easy decision but my choice in the matter is final,” said Dutton.

“Personally, I’ve got nothing against Mr The Creator. I know he raps about pseudo-rape and beating women – hell, even Bill Shorten and Tony Abbott have been linked to that sort of debauchery,”

“This is about about supporting Australian jobs and protecting our local industry.”

Coralie Alison, the director of operations for Collective Shout, has now become the receptacle of Tyler, The Creator’s fan bases hate and anger.

Supporters of the LA-born rapper have requested that Alison died a ‘slow and painful death’ and that ‘it’s political correctness gone mad”.

“I don’t see what the problem is?” she said.

“You have a man on stage in front of thousands of people, singing about how it’s ‘just a G thang’ to beat, rape and murder women – it’s 2015. Those things are not OK,”

“I’m not sorry. There is a line in the sand… and Tyler, The Creator  crossed it a long time ago. Bitch.” she said.

In 2007, US rapper Snoop Dogg was banned from entering Australia because of past convictions for drugs and firearms offences.

Australia’s then immigration minister, Kevin Andrews, said that the 35-year-old millionaire wasn’t allowed into the country on a short-stay visa because of his extensive criminal record.

Sadly, he was granted a visa last year to perform at Big Day Out. during such time, he was pictured on his own Instagram account next to a mountain of what he called “the chronic, Negro”.

Experts Agree: Anyone Who Joins A Political Party Before They Turn 30 Is A Fuckwit

TEXT:

Samuel White-Kelly from Indooroopilly in Brisbane’s south-west, says he is not concerned about being liked by his high school peers.

The 16-year-old is occasionally “flushed” and very often “noogied” by bigger classmates, however, it seems no one cares. Not even him.

“It’s because of me being me. But no one does anything about it. The teachers think I deserve it. I’ll show them one day… This is my coming of age”

But why is Samuel such a target?

Samuel is a vocal member of The Young Labor Party.

“Kids can be mean, I cop a lot of heat for just being me… I’m outspoken about my affinity for the Young Labor and union movements, so of course I get beat up a lot.”

Samuel’s parents say they were originally concerned about the reoccurring black eyes and torn school uniform, but quickly understood it was just part and parcel with their son’s interest in being a politically outspoken sixteen-year-old.

Bruce White, Samuel’s dad, initially thought his son was a victim of hate crimes.

“She did clarify that my son is just a dork. A political dork, which is the worst kind,”

“When I was his age I didn’t even know who the Prime Minister was – the kid is showing no signs of wanting to be a normal kid… I leave full bottles of rum out in the open… In the hope that he will steal them from me”

“The kid doesn’t want a bar of it, he would rather watch Q&A”

“It might be just a phase but if the kid doesn’t stop it with the rallies and marches – he’s going to be a virgin for a very long time.”

Samuel claims his love for politics is not contrived, and that he has plenty of time for girlfriends when he is in power.

“These idiots will never understand, I will be in charge one day”

Q&A: Jacqui Lambie Reveals How Terrified She Was Of Matching Up Against Alan Jones

TEXT:

Senator Jacqui Lambie has revealed the gruelling personal torment she had to endure prior to an appearance on ABC’s Q&A last night.

The Tasmanian single mother-turned politician says she spent weeks preparing herself for the very likely possibility of saying something stupid in front of talkback radio personality, Alan Jones.

“I was ready to go, but god damn it was scary!” said the excited former Palmer United senator.

“I think me and Alan agreed on most things, but I have the tendency to overstep the mark a bit and that was the worry,”

“We all know what can happen then…. He’s had to straighten out Tony Abbott for doing that quite a bit lately…

“….I just had to hope I didn’t start talking about something I didn’t fully understand. Because obviously I can’t bluff Alan”

“Like every other politician in Australia, I was pretty much at his mercy,”

“He knows so much more about everything… and for some reason, his opinion is far more important than anyone who has been elected into power by the Australian public”

Alan Jones has since responded to Ms Lambies confession.

“Senator Lambie should not all worry about me, there is a lot of potential for us to work together”

“I have been elected into MY position, by the public… they voted me in with twenty years of the highest talkback radio ratings in Australia” said an extremely educated and articulated Alan Jones.

“I have more right than Gillard did, or the Rudd government that followed her. I was flat out while those two were in charge. Both mummy and daddy”

“Tony Abbott isn’t much better, I’m sure you’re aware that Mr Abbott has lost all Prime Minister privileges until he can learn how to show some respect,”

Portrait of Tony Abbott hung as Archibald finalist despite backlash

TEXT:

DESPITE VEHEMENT PROTESTS and an online petition, Frances Abbott’s portrait of her father has been hung along side the Archibald Prize finalists at the Art Gallery of NSW today.

Late last month, the trustee board of the famous art prize made an exception to all submission deadlines, due to the young creative designer’s inability make the cut-off.

The board’s decision was met with furious public anger as many punters felt she should have to abide by the same rules as everybody else.

However, the calls for Ms Abbott’s painting to be withdrawn from the prestigious art prize fell on deaf ears. The winner of the 2015 Archibald Prize is to be announced tomorrow in Sydney and already art critics and commentators have labelled the portrait of PM Tony Abbott a frontrunner.

Should Frances Abbott win the Archibald Prize tomorrow, she’d be one of only a handful of women to do so – and the first to win it with a debut artwork.  In fact, over 80% of Archibald winners have been men.

The portrait was met with a mixed critical response, with SMH Arts Editor Joel Meares describing the artwork as “a half-polished turd”, while Daily Telegraph culture writer Rebecca Mulligan heralded the oil painting as “Ms Abbott’s magnum opus; her stunning debut in to the world of art”.

The Art Gallery of NSW has defended the decision to allow Ms Abbott to deliver her now-finalist artwork, saying that while all entrants are judged equally, some are more equal than others.

“We made an exception to the rule because it’s an exceptional artwork, and the first ever portrait of our current Prime Minister” said Angus Capon.

“It’s not everyday we break protocol, but in this instance, we thought she deserved a fair go. Both as an artist, and as a woman. Her story is powerful.”

“It’s akin to the migrant story. Nobody should be unfairly judged by their family background.”

In it’s 94th year, the prize attracted approximately 800 entrants submitting portraits-of-photographs of conservative politicians, other artists, and Aboriginal Australians that white people have heard about.

This year’s finalists appear to be a far cry from the typical bumper crop of B-list male Australian actors and iconic Labor identities.

However, in true Archibald fashion, a portrait of Michael Caton won this year’s Packing Room Prize.

In a photo released via the Art Gallery of NSW’s website, Frances Abbott’s portrait of the Prime Minister sits between two similarly political portraits: Bob Katter MP (painted by Cairns artist, Kristin Tennyson) and Senator Cory Bernardi (Stewart MacFarlane).

The latter of the three men gave comment to the Herald today, about how this year’s list of Archibald finalists gives a fair indication of the current state of Australian politics.

“There it is, from Parliament to the Archibald packing room. A conservative revolution,” said an excited Senator Bernardi

“It was a matter of time until our country’s politics crossed over into our art, and I couldn’t be happier.”

As usual, Bob Katter MP was also keen to give comment.

“The painting is bloody deadly!” said the jovial leader of the Katter’s Australia Party.

“It’s a shame about the two other blokes, but I’m glad to see our nation’s artists paying homage to their local members. If Kristin doesn’t bag the prize, I’ll be calling for a bloody enquiry [laughter]”.

Gallery spokesman, Angus Capon, says the new trend of conservative subjects spells out exciting times ahead for the Australian art scene.

“Our trustee board was ecstatic. If you are looking to please an assortment of grey-haired millionaires, I think your best bet is to paint the people they worship”

“We have had VIP’s booking special tours of the gallery ever since the announcements. Gina Rhinehart, Ben Quilty, Russell Crowe. Just today Tim Storrier came in to have a closer look at his close friend, Prime Minister Abbott.”

Kevin Rudd returns to his former job as Bulimba hoodrat

TEXT:

FORMER BULIMBA PERSONALITY Kevin Rudd says he’s readjusting to life-after-politics well, returning to his old job as a stand over man.

Before entering politics, Mr Rudd was a well-known and respected resident of the leafy Brisbane suburb. He made a living settling disputes and providing mediation as well as providing security for local businesses.

“My old Broncos hoodie still fits me,” says Rudd.

The 57-year-old admits he missed walking up and down the Oxford Street shopping precinct while he was away doing other things around the world.

It’s been a long time coming for the former parliamentarian and diplomat, who was recently able to resettle his family back in to the hustle and bustle of Brisbane life.

“It’s great to be back. Not much has changed, though,”

However, it hasn’t always been smooth sailing for the four-eyed silver fox.

In 1975, he was charged by local police for having the knees of his 67-year-old tennis partner broken after she allegedly threw the game.

The woman, Judith Murray from nearby New Farm, was left with limited function in both her legs and never played tennis again.

Another incident in 1983 saw Rudd arrested over a string of muggings in the area which left a number of tourists with serious facial injuries and contusions.

He was supposedly the leader of a pack of young hoodlums that preyed about unsuspecting travellers that frequented the Bulimba Ferry.

Rudd and his gang would follow ‘yuppie dickheads’, as his convicted criminal partner stated in court in 2006, and hit them over the head with a length of gidgee.

“Those were great days, but yes I have grown up.”

Manus Island and Nauru removed from Google Maps

TEXT:

Australian Anti-Censorship activists are in uproar today, as it is revealed that the Pacific islands of Nauru and Manus Island are no longer viewable on Google Maps.

The new censorship measures are said to be a result of the Australian Border Force Act, which came into force on Monday. The act makes it an offence for an “entrusted person” to make a record of or disclose “protected information” about Australian immigration detention centres.

The penalty for an individual found guilty of this offence is two years’ imprisonment.

As both Manus Island and Nauru play host to two of Australia’s most controversial detention centres, it seems Google Australia may have chosen to remove themselves from all legal strife by pretending Nauru and Manus Island don’t exist.

Prior to the passing of the bill, lawyers and asylum seeker advocates were voicing concerns that the act will have a “chilling effect” on whistleblowers working in detention centres, but very few identified the risk it might have on Australia’s understanding of geography.

Google Australasia CEO, Bernice Birley spoke to the Advocate today about these new censorship measures.

“Essentially, this government is very protective of information surrounding immigration detention, and like whistleblowers on the ground, Google now has the responsibility of making sure no one can get a good idea of what goes on inside these ‘island prisons’

The stateless people who are subject to these “processing centres” find themselves there due to their decision to illegally travel thousands of kilometres via leaky boats in the hope that they might find a community that is willing to accept them, or at least not rape and execute them over extreme misunderstandings of sacred texts – However, it would seem their lives in detention, up until yesterday, were similarly depressing.

According to the recounts of workers prior to yesterdays new laws, desperate and dispirited asylum seekers at the Australian-run detention centre on Nauru formed “suicide pacts”, identified themselves as numbers instead of by name, and were treated like animals by some guards.

“If I had known I was going to end up killing myself due to the torturous conditions of an Australian detention centre, I would have just done it prior to giving my family’s entire life savings to the people smugglers that promised to get me here” says 11-year old Asha.

However, since the new laws were put in place, authorities insist living conditions on the island prisons are on the up and up.

Female banker forced to retire early after coming out

TEXT:

It was a secret she lived with for more than 20 years.

It was one of those open secrets that many people knew, but never spoke out loud about it.

“For 20 years I worked in a closet. Closets are for gays, not bankers,” said McConnor, who’s four days away from retirement after 30 years in financial services.

She shared her secret with only those close to her because of fear.

“You fear being caught saying something offensive. You fear being labelled. You fear not being invited to weddings,” she said.

This week, Amanda McConnor , 54, retiring vice-president at Grainer Investments in Sydney, is telling everyone.

She’s racist.

“I was worried about my job. The fear was very real,” said McConnor, who had a racist friend who made some crude remarks about the Jewish influence in overseas markets and suddenly became ‘the racist chick’ in the office.

The industry says it’s OK to be bigoted behind closed doors, but being an openly racist woman is not.

“It’s not OK that the men in the office are allowed to galavanting around and drop racist jokes and nobody thinks twice. A woman does it and everybody freaks out,” she said.

Her domestic partner of 21 years, Brett Davidson was always been there to support her.

“Brett has been very understanding and open about my transition in to a bigoted woman,” she said.

Although McConnor always felt supported by her partner, colleagues and her board, she knew that her identity crisis would rub people the wrong way.

Like many female racists, McConnor feared being bullied in the workplace by ‘politically correct pin heads’ because of her conservative opinions.

Amanda came out when he was 33, telling her parents and close friends. She was a floor trader for Credit Suisse at the time.
She thought about fully coming out and moving to the Sunshine Coast, the spiritual home of the Australian racist. But that would mean leaving the racist minority in the financial system to fend for themselves.
“I went into finance to make a fuck ton of money,” she said.
Amanda said she feared her life would be over if she came out as a racist female banker. PHOTO: Supplied.
And for McConnor it was better “to stay in the trenches” and support racist bankers and remind them that they are loved by their mates for always having great racist jokes.
“We’d workshop our racist opinions and jokes in private. I wanted them to know that they weren’t alone,” she said.
At a board meeting, Amanda told the group that RBLSX (Racist, Bigoted, Liberal-voting, Sectarian and Xenophobic) workers needed help because they were self-harming: trading futures, investing in renewable energy and numbing out through currency trading.
RBLSX workers are killing themselves, she told them.
“I know you know this. I know their frustration. I’m racist,” said McConnor, recounting the story this week.
No one seemed surprised, she recalls.
Although it felt lonely at times, Amanda said she always felt supported by her peers. A recruiter encouraged her to apply for the position of vice-president.
“I never felt that I couldn’t be in senior management because I was really, really racist,” said McConnor, who worked as a private asset manager before becoming vice-principal.
And the board gave McConnor the space to do her work. Slowly she introduced programs at Grainer such as the Asian Joke Thursday campaign, which reminded other workers that Asians cannot reverse park. She was instrumental in inviting disgusting racist workers back to the industry, along with their other racist mates, to talk to current traders about their experiences.
As a young floor trader, Amanda said she had to bite her tongue often. PHOTO: Supplied.
Days away from retirement, McConnor said she’s looking forward to living a life that is “more free.”
“I’m proud to be a racist banker. I’m proud to have represented RBLSX workers. Now it’s time to represent myself more honestly,” she said.
She plans to spend more time with her Reclaim Australia friends in Logan and is a bassist in a Mt Coot-ha-based skinhead band.
She also wants to advocate for racist bankers in the system who need support.
“I challenge all banks to be more consciously aware of racist staff.”

Free Speech Activist Finds Himself Defending Terrorism During Heated Argument

TEXT:

As debates continue to rage over the Australian Broadcasting Corporations’ inclusion of a terror suspect in the audience of their Monday night program, Q&A – One man has found himself arguing in defence of the national broadcaster, to the point of him actually sounding like someone who sympathises with terrorists.

Brendan Suffern, an online campaign strategist and champion of free speech, had argued the subject with his peers for roughly two hours in the beer garden of Sydney’s Chippendale hotel yesterday afternoon.

“He went too far, his whole free-speech tirade ended up with him looking like a full-blown IS sympathiser” said one shocked onlooker.

The ABC has been heavily criticised this week for allowing Zaky Mallah, a terror suspect who admitted to threatening to kill Australian security officials but was acquitted of the charges, to appear on Q&A.

However Mr Suffern believes his shock-factor style of arguing is justified when debated one of “the most important freedoms of them all”.

“I wasn’t nearly as out-of-line as the Newscorp headlines. I was just saying that Zaky Mallah has just as much right as being on QandA as Josh Thomas, 360 or any other fucked up member of Generation Y”

“The guys are just back page, telegraph bogans. They would prefer to read a column by Buzz Rothfield than watch the news,”

“I never said I support terrorism, but how do you define terrorism? I think a lot of the terrorists in this country wear blue ties,”

However, Mr Suffern’s close mates who also claim to share similar “progressive” political view, have lambasted his behaviour. One has come out saying “Brendan has lost the fucking plot”

“I find it pretty easy to define terrorism. I guess anyone who threatens to decapitate our commonwealth official is a terrorist” says close mate, Jesse Dunn.

“He’s off his fucken head. I mean, sure we all love a bit of ABC comedy – we all grew up with the shit… but he’s taking his loyalty to this bizarre media organisation to a whole new level,”

“Essentially, he’s just spent two hours telling us that terrorists have rights in this country,”

“We begged him to condemn the actions of Zaky Mallah… He wouldn’t give us an inch. It’s as though he thinks free speech means do whatever you want, whenever you want and not face consequences”

“He’s a champagne socialist, mate. I can guarantee you his parents voted for Tony Abbott,”

BREAKING: Australian Government To Trial Gay-Marriage In Tasmania

TEXT:

The Abbott government has agreed to briefly allow gay marriage In Tasmania, under a new trial.

The Federal Government is contemplating legislation that will “meet those gay rights folk half way”. Under the plan entitled ‘Get sassy in tassie’ same sex marriage would be allowed in the apple isle but not on the mainland.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott revealed the plan at the national Liberal Party conference today following a landmark Supreme Court ruling in the United States.

“Tassie has been a pretty good guinea pig over the years. Smoking, pokie machines, Kevin Rudd’s $900 pay-out. If there’s anything that we need to try out, we send it down there,”

“Most of the time the Tasmanians don’t really know the law to begin with,”

Abbott has stated that Tasmania will provide them a contained environment to observe and monitor the effects gay marriage would have on the community.

“If this thing fucks out… at least it’s only Tasmania” said one liberal source from the conservative wing of the party.

“This will get those greenies off our backs and onto each other’s”

Tasmanian tourism has embraced the plan describing the injection of the so-called pink dollar a “game changer”.

These pigs have doomed us all

TEXT:

A REPORT PUBLISHED under the supervision of the US and British governments has concluded that Baby Boomers have doomed us all.

The planet has been damaged beyond repair, says the report, by the people who were born immediately after World War II to the mid 1960’s. Their way of life has been discovered as the source of all future misery that the world will face.

Thanks to the Baby Boomers, the world is now warming at an unsustainable rate. This fact will spell disaster for the way the humankind lives until the end of time.

Climate change is their fault and they’ve doomed as all.

The Food System Shock report, released by Macquarie Bank this week and developed by La Trobe University’s Global Sustainability Institute in the Wodonga, suggests a cataclysmic series of events will sweep the world, triggered by a combination of climate change, food and water shortages, energy loss and political instability.

This is largely because the third world has been left to reproduce at an ungodly pace. The medical breakthroughs that the baby boomers made have also ruined the future because now even poor people can afford a decent level of healthcare.

According to popular baby boomer opinion, the problem of overpopulation and food shortages can be solved by letting a plague in the third world go unchecked.

58-year-old Mooloolaba plumber Keith Blackstem says that the government should let “bird, swine or SARS flu go out of control” to help ease the strain on the planets natural resources.

“We need another plague. That should do the trick,” he said.

“That and we stop exporting our surplus food. Fuck ’em. Aussies always land on their feet.”

When asked how she felt about being the cause of her grandson’s impending death, 61-year-old Brisbane mother Glenda Turnley said she felt horrible, but the 70’s was one hell of a time.

“I know that my piggery as a 20-something Brissie blonde bombshell will ultimately cause my dear grandson to starve to death, I had no way of knowing until now,”

“I’m sorry, but at the same time, I’m not,”

“Me and my friends will be dead in a decade or two so we won’t be around to listen to our kids complain about how we’ve ruined everything for them.”

Tony Abbott Refuses To Deny That He Also Tried To Bribe Waleed Aly

TEXT:

The Federal Opposition has requested an urgent independent investigation into claims that Australian authorities tried to stop Channel Ten panel-host, Waleed Aly, from airing a segment that suggests that “bribes have been paid” to people smugglers to return a boat to Indonesia.

It is believed that Waleed Aly was offered a “generous amount” of clean and untraceable Australian dollars, in exchange for him “going easy” on the troubled Prime Minister.

Those were the words that echoed out of television screens right around the country last Friday night. They came from The Project’s host Waleed Aly.

Today it has been revealed just how far the Australian Prime Minister was willing to go to make sure it didn’t happen.

It is believed Waleed Aly spent approximately four hours toying with his decision to ultimately not accept a second round of bribes from the boat-stopping Australian government. In turn, the segment was aired on The Project for all single mums waiting for Masterchef to see.

An unnamed Network Ten whistleblower has come out and detailed what went down.

“Abbott knew Waleed was going to put him in the spot, it was a smart move to not appear on the show… but Waleed still had questions for him.” said the 29-year-old unpaid production intern.

“Waleed showed a lot of self-control to not accept the bribe from the Abbott government – It was enough to buy a house in Parramatta if ya know what i’m sayin’

Another likeminded Channel Ten panel host, Hugh Riminton has also come out with praise for Mr. Aly who is also known as “The thinking man’s Alan Jones”.

“I was very surprised Aly didn’t take the cash. It was quick, clean and untraceable. I’m the first to admit I have accepted several bribes from both Peta Credlin and Tony Abbott,” said a unashamed Riminton.

“Earlier this year, The Prime Minister paid me a lot of money to not air the footage of him smashing a raw onion on Ten Eyewitness News – I took the bribe without thinking twice,”

Hugh Riminton went on to explain the difference between a young ambitious journalist like Waleed Aly, and seasoned lifer, like himself.

“Waleed obviously doesn’t have kids in private school, yet. One of these days he will figure out the game, but until then I would have to congratulate him for his moral fibre.”

While members of the people smuggling outfit in question have said that Australian officials handed over thousands of dollars in cash after intercepting their vessel, Abbott refuses to either confirm or deny these allegations as well.

Indonesia is investigating the claims and has asked Australia’s ambassador in Jakarta for an explanation.

Tony Abbott Suggests Fracking Drills Are “Far Sexier” Than Wind Turbines

TEXT:

Prime Minister Tony Abbott has described wind farms as “visually awful”, saying he wishes the Howard government, of which he was a member, had never implemented the Renewable Energy Target (RET) policy.

“When I’ve been up close to these things, not only are they visually awful, but they make a lot of noise,” Mr Abbott told Sydney broadcaster Alan Jones on Thursday.

“I mean, if we have to designate a certain part of regional Australian to the long-term existence of man-made structures in order to power our homes, I would pick coal or oil – or CSG”

“I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, watching foreign owned coal and gas corporations tear our Australian soil apart in the quest for fossil fuels is far more attractive than some dumb-arse wind turbine.

This isn’t the first time Abbott has made reference to his object sexuality.

“Those fracking drills are sexy AF” he tweeted late last year, after visiting the once thriving agricultural hub known as the Darling Downs in western Queensland.

Abbott continued on his anti-renewable campaign when speaking to Jones on 2GB yesterday.

“Turbines are so kitsch. I can’t believe people want them installed on their own properties. All they do is kill birds and hum like a ceiling fan.”

“We are a stylish nation and we need to power our country in style,”

“Will gay marriage make my marriage less sacred”

No. Gay marriage is yet to be aligned with any particular Church. It’s quite obviously mostly about terms of reference and tax purposes.

“Will gay marriage mean my gay daughter feels more comfortable in her own skin”

Yes.

No. Your sons will continue to dream about the performing arts while you abuse them from the sideline.

“Will gay marriage affect my ability to have extramarital affairs with other married people”

No, it will increase your ability to have extramarital affairs, on both sides of the fence.

“Will gay marriage increase the price of beer at the MCG?”

Absolutely not. Caterers will be ecstatic with these new changes.

“Will gay marriage mean I can no longer flog my wife in God-given sanctity”

No, but we have forwarded on your details to the nearest police station and local motorcycle club.

“Will gay marriage affect my wife’s floristry company”

No. Have you got fucking rocks in your head?

Shock Jock Kyle Sandilands Considers Move To Federal Politics

TEXT:

BOUYED BY HIS recent on-air stoush with Nationals deputy Barnaby Joyce, radio shock jock Kyle Sandilands is rumoured to be planning to run as an independent at the next federal election.

The 43-year-old has reportedly set his sights on claiming his home seat, the Division of Bonner, in Brisbane’s south east.

The KISS FM star’s hometown of Wynnum is widely considered “Australia’s Jersey Shore” as it’s derelict boardwalks, rampant knife crime and anti-intellectualism draws comparisons to Atlantic City, a hollow shell of a place.

Earlier this month, Sandilands berated Joyce over the Johnny Depp dog fiasco, where he called the Minister for Agriculture “an insensitive wanker” and an “idiot”.

Insiders are now speculating whether this may have led Sandilands to believe that his bullying and belittling skills may be easily transferable to a career in Canberra.

However, more than just a couple of Wynnum locals have been left scratching their heads over his plan to run for his home electorate.

“Mate, he’s got no chance,” said one local bartender.

“I reckon fuckin’ Paul Gallon [sic] would have a better chance winning the hearts and minds of Wynnum.”

The bartender’s sentiments were echoed by Candise Critchon, a Bay Terrace beautician, who said that Sandilands is “out of touch” with the rest of the nation when it comes to “the politics” [sic].

“Isn’t his bloody listenership women aged in their 40’s or some shit?” she said.

“At least Clive Palmer had the decency to wine and dine the Sunshine Coast before he tried to slip it in the back door.”

Despite repeated requests from The Advocate, nobody with any ties to any related party was available for comment.

VIDEO: Nightclub Crowd Goes Wild As Aussie Politician Gets Behind The Decks

TEXT:

Australian Shadow Transport Minister, Anthony Albanese has jumped behind the decks at a notorious Sydney nightclub, spinning tunes as DJ Albo.

Mr Albanese began his set at 3:00am last night, firing up the 500-strong crowd at a secluded warehouse party in the city’s inner-west.

“Albo” says he decided on a cameo set after being asked to help promote the club by a family friend who had invested heavily in the gay-raver community.

It followed his well-received hosting appearance on ABC music show Rage in 2013.

“It went off, it was a good night,” he told Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson on Channel Nine’s TODAY.

“I usually play a broader mix of medium side-trance. But this crowd was really something else. I was very impressed with their form… for a monday night at least”

“I let them lick up a dirty spread of some textbook EDM. Some really trappy drops. I bet half of them didn’t realise I used to be deputy Prime Minister.”

Mr Albanese sent the crowd wild by shouting out neighbouring inner-city suburbs. At one point the usually mild-mannered politician is heard to be criticizing the current Australian Prime Minister by shouting “Fuck Tony Abbott”.

When queried about some of the vulgar language that can be heard during his set, Albanese defended himself by saying he just got carried away after a few drinks in his constituents.

“I was raised no more than two kilometres from here,” said the charismatic 52-year-old.

“My mother raised me with three great faiths: electronic dance music, the South Sydney Football Club and the Australian Labor Party,”

“Last night I was back in Rabbitohs (South Sydney) territory, playing music and drinking vodka OJ’s,”

“If I can’t drop the F-bomb when surrounded by friends in my own hometown. Well, what can I do?”

“It was better than heading to the local club for a rubber chicken dinner, which most Labor party functions tend to be.”

It is unknown whether Anthony Albanese MP will return to the decks any time soon, but he says he appreciated the “one-off”.

Treasurer Joe Hockey All Set For Stirring Farewell Speech In Canberra Tonight

TEXT:

The 2014 Budget’s biggest hitter, the concept of forcing young people without a job to wait six months before they could receive benefits, has failed to pass the Senate and has triggered outcry from social services groups.

It appears that this, among many other things, may have been the deciding factor surrounding Joe Hockey insisting that he will no longer be Federal Treasurer by the end of the week.

This morning Mr Hockey confirmed the $1.2 billion savings initiative had not survived the budget process intact and was going to be presented as a different model in tonight’s 2015 budget address.

“You’ll see a changed version of that,” he said, in the traditional early morning budget day doorstop with the media, one of his last media scrums for the foreseeable future.

Questions had just been interrupted by a grinning onlooker who asked the Treasurer for a “selfie” with the person who is in charge of the money that we get taxed.

“Oh she’s obviously just a bit emotional that the Joe-dog is giving up his spot as the Treash [Federal Treasurer]” said Mr Hockey, who was speaking in third person.

“Joe’s gotta do what Joe’s gotta do. This ain’t checkers it’s *********in’ chess!”

Joe Hockey has also stated his final farewell will take place at the same time as his final task. The 2015 Budget Address.

Death Cult Fashionistas: Top 5 Best Dressed Freedom Fighters Announced

TEXT:

THE FIVE FINALISTS of the inaugural “best dressed freedom fighter” have been announced at a gala event overnight in the Somali capital, Mogadishu.

The celebration of conflict fashion was hosted by the International Freedom Fighters’ Guild (IFFG), which is also classified as a terrorist organisation by the United States.

Judges whittled down over 200 entrants to arrive at the final five, that sees some of the world’s most downtrodden and hostile insurgent groups represented for the first time.

IFFG President Mushtaq al-Zurbak says that the awards ceremony provides an opportunity for all the hard work done by freedom fighters around the world to be recognised.

“Some of these insurgents have fought against oppressive governments for decades,” says al-Zurbak.

“Others have been lucky enough to escape capture by fascist western authorities,”

“This isn’t just a celebration of wartime fashion, it’s a display of creativity.”

This 35-year-old warhorse has been fighting Russian tyranny since he was just a small boy. When he was just entering high school, Bilyal become enchanted with UK-based fashion house, Burberry – a love that would last him a lifetime.

“I found this coat on a photojournalist,”

“There is very cold winters in Chechnya and the reporter didn’t need this coat because he was dead already,”

Mr Arishedze said he plans to return home to Chechnya after a short holiday in Saudi Arabia where he hopes to “buy a few things” to aid the revolution.

There’s only one thing that’s got Fred Kanyeihamba more excited than Tame Impala’s upcoming album Currents – and that’s freedom from religious persecution from his government.

Although a newcomer to the world of freedom fighting, this bubbly 44-year-old says he likes to turn heads on the battlefield with his bold fashion tastes.

“People are more interested and shocked by my intriguing fashion than my disturbing insensitivity to gruesome violence,”

“Polyester blends don’t breathe as well as pure cotton, so I love brands like Target Country and Espirit.”

Fred hopes he wins so he can have the opportunity to highlight the genocide of his minority.

As the youngest finalist, it’s odd that child soldier Amira Qenco has almost no presence on social media.

The happy-go-lucky Sagittarius says she’s too preoccupied to maintain Snapchat and Facebook accounts, stating there’s more important things in her life such as protecting her homeland and people from terrorist groups like ISIS and al-Qaeda and tending to her flock of goats.

“I’m happy not having those things in my life,” said the Iranian national.

“Life is much more wholesome when you don’t spend most of it fussing about what other people think of you,”

“The constant reminder of how fragile life is actually quite humbling in a way.”

Amira and some of her friends where featured recently on 60 Minutes with Tara Brown – who refused to take her bulletproof vest off until she arrived back in Dubai.

Australians leaving to fight in Syria have received a lot of negative press recently. As most of them have left to fight with the now infamous ISIS death cult – but this patriotic Syrian blooded fighter left years ago to join the Free Syrian Army (FSA).

As the FSA is now unofficially backed by the United States, he’s likely to be able to return home to his Fitzroy home one day.

“I came here to fight because Assad murdered half my family,” said the 26-year-old.

“Not because I was disenfranchised with the Australian way of life or because I want to fight for my God,”

Once the tyrannical Assad regime has been defeated, Shalhoud plans to open up a supplement shop with his cousin, Hazmat.

Last but not least is a charismatic 31-year-old arms dealer from the gorgeous Libyan seaside village of Misrata.

After completing a degree in economics at a prestigious British university, Azeem returned home to work for Muammar Gaddafi as a private financial advisor.

Having left the world of finance just prior to the 2011 Libyan Civil War, Mr Yousuf found himself unemployed and on the run.

“Having done a few backdoor arms deals in the past, I though it was a perfect role for me to fall in to,”

“Turns out it’s been pretty lucrative. I live in a nice, western city at the moment and everybody thinks I’m a Saudi oil baron – same thing really.”

Human rights violator “better qualified” to run budget, says Abbott.

TEXT:

SCOTT MORRISON is emerging as the new Liberal pin-up boy, just months after being accused of violating human rights by the United Nations.

The minister for social services has become the face of a new Coalition advertising campaign which markets the sprightly 46-year-old as a “softer and more approachable” politician, as opposed to the ever evanescent Joseph B. Hockey  or the perennially downtrodden Tony Abbott.

Speaking this morning on Channel 9, Morrison’s segment was introduced from the ad break with a stirring rendition “My Hero” by the Foo Fighters before he easily disposed of a string of hostile questions from host Lisa Wilkinson in true rock star form.

Replacing the overtly socialist “Tony Abbott hopeless” billboards in Sydney’s Chippendale, the federal government has paid for their own advertising material to replace the once famous Shepard Fairey rip-off of Obama’s hope image.

Plans to include “pro-Liberal propaganda” in the inner-west has been met with unbridled backlash, with local residents lashing out at suggestions that Scott Morrison is a suitable replacement for anybody in federal politics.

“Is everybody suffering from amnesia?” said one Redfern local.

“Personally, I’d rather have Joe Hockey as PM over Scot Morrison – at least he had the balls to go on Q&A alone.” she said.

Treasurer Joe Hockey is releasing his second budget tomorrow morning and is promised by the PM that he’ll keep his job regardless of the reaction, whether it be good or bad.

“Joe is the right man for the job,” said Mr Abbott.

“He’s led the treasury with great wisdom and intelligence for a long time now and I have every confidence that he’ll continue to do so in the future,”

This Is How Fred Nile Plans To Keep Sydney Safe

TEXT:

NEW SOUTH WALES hinge-voter MP Fred Nile is proposing new laws that would raise the legal drinking age, ban Islamic dress and force women who are thinking about terminating a problem pregnancy witness what they’re about to remove on an ultrasound.

The Christian Democratic Party (CDP) leader is planning to put the legislation before the NSW Upper House this week.

That’s not all.

In leaked internal documents obtained by The Advocate, the impassioned leader has revealed plans to “secure” his bible belt stronghold – by sealing The Hills District off from the rest of modern society.

Mr Nile has outlined that modern society poses the biggest threat to Christianity in contemporary Australia and has decided himself that creating a walled protectorate within Sydney is the only course of action that will safeguard morals.

Following a recent trip to the Middle East, the right-leaning octogenarian was inspired by the ingenuity and religious devotion he witnessed in Israel – leading Nile to propose “walling his people in” to protect them from Muslims, homosexuals, abortions, China, libertarianism and other disgusting by-products of modern society.

The first of many proposed measures will be the construction of a “military style” checkpoint on the M2 Motorway to screen vehicles entering Christian settlements in order to search for any forbidden material.

It’s understood that homosexuals and Muslims will be turned away at the border and asked to take the long way around using the M4 and Great Western Highway.

In addition to this first measure, any non-Christians currently residing within Mr Nile’s citadel will be detained and forced into “non-believer” ghettos – where they will be processed and their fate decided by an evangelical faith healer.

The faith healer will be personally ordained by Mr Nile and given executive power under the party guidelines.

Also earmarked for change in the manner in which media is consumed within Nile’s strongholds, whereby all news, current affairs, sport and commercial programming will be first screened by a Christian censor.

What this means is that advertising geared toward one or more of the seven deadly sins will not be shown in the Hills District, under these proposed measures.

Gambling, alcohol, food, sex and politically motivated advertising will be banned.

Despite numerous rumours, the proposed Christian Democratic Auxiliary Christian Police (CDACP) will not be armed with automatic weapons but rather semi-automatic, as these weapons are still legal to own and operate provided you have an appropriate reason.

Such reasons that currently exist under law for private ownership of a centrefire semi-automatic weapon include roo shooting and use during a religious ceremony.

As Fred Nile has the balance of power vote in the NSW parliament, he’s like to get his way with these proposed measures – include the right to bare arms against, of which he plans to introduce in the coming weeks.

Opposition frontbenchers reveal their IQs in bold political stunt

TEXT:

BILL SHORTEN HAS once again proved himself to be the man most suited with leading the Opposition after members of the shadow cabinet revealed their IQs overnight.

The opposition leader was found to be the most intelligent among the assorted socialists, with an IQ of 45 – just pipping Senator Penny Wong, who scored a respectable 44.

Having been heavily influenced by the haphazard nature in which Labor state governments have handled transport portfolios in the past, shadow transport minister Anthony Albanese scored on the lower end of the scale with a mildly predictable 39.

Shadow environment and climate change minister Mark Butler would’ve score higher had it not been for his complete failure to provide any contrasting policy ideas, by which to combat the Abbott administration’s plan to dredge the Great Barrier Reef and cut down primary forests in Tasmania.

Queensland’s Courier Mail has lambasted the shadow leadership team for their “apparently paltry” IQ scores, reporting that even Forrest Gump had an IQ of 75 – prompting his mother to begrudgingly engage in some “low-quality intercourse” in order for Forrest to attend the local elementary school.

These latest figures to come out of Canberra have failed to surprise those working in primary industries and the rural sector of Australian industry, who feel vindicated by the results.

Many regional Australians have long suspected that the Labor Party has lagged behind the Coalition when it comes to agricultural policy.

Their feelings have been echoed by other industries, who feel the Opposition has failed in their duty to offer a tangible alternative to the incumbent government’s pro-small business and anti-environmental framework.

Kevin Parker and Julia Gillard talk new projects and Currents on ABC Radio

TEXT:

FORMER PM JULIA Gillard has admitted this afternoon to enjoying the new musical direction Tame Impala has taken with their new album Currents.

Speaking today on ABC Radio Perth with the band’s creative force Kevin Parker, Ms Gillard said the new sound shows the maturity of the Western Australian group as they’re set to release their third album by the end of the month.

“I’ve been a long time fan of the boys,” said Ms Gillard.

“Tim found them on MySpace back when I first became the education minister in like 2007 or 2008 – I can’t even remember now,”

“They just sounded so different. Bob Brown would come over and we’d get so high, I used to roll around for hours on my shag pile carpet and listen to them,

“It was like being back at university again.” she said.

Mr Parker was surprisingly more reserved that the former PM, saying on that he’s flattered to know that high-level government ministers and staff liked his music.

“Yeah, it’s pretty neat.” said the 29-year-old.

In support of the new album, Tame Impala will embark on a world tour later this week. See the updated schedule below:

News Corp Australia in turmoil as they “forgot about the election” in NSW today

TEXT:

AN INTERNAL INVESTIGATION is underway at News Corp Australia this afternoon after claims the media giant “forgot there was an election on today” were confirmed by CEO Julian Clarke.

The rumor mill went in to overdrive this morning as subscribers and readers of The Daily Telegraph and The Weekend Australian awoke to a newspaper that is almost entirely void of political analysis, comment or even hard news on the topic.

It’s a development that’s rocked the conglomerate to its core, as elections are typically heavily featured by their papers.

In a statement this morning, Julian Clarke said that “today is one of the darkest days in the history of News Corp Australia and the culprits will be uncovered and punished”.

“Australians look to publications such as The Daily Telegraph, The Australian and The Courier-Mail for the most in-depth and independent political news and analysis,” he said.

“However today, we dropped the ball and for that I’m truly sorry,”

“An internal investigation has been launched to discover where we went wrong and to unveil who is ultimately responsible for “forgetting there was an election on today” in NSW.”

On the flip side, for the first time since 1984, Fairfax Media is set to make a profit today for their ability to remember the election.

The Sydney Morning Herald this morning lived up to its marketing department’s claim that it’s “Independent. Always.” by  showing both leadership candidates on the front page.

Placed in their order of importance to Sydneysiders, The Herald has chosen to place coverage of the Germanwings disaster atop the page, followed by election coverage – which is slightly more important than informing readers of an outdoor chair sale.

In recent years, the struggling newspaper empire has struggled to keep in the black.

On 18 June 2012, Fairfax Media announced it would cut 1,900 underpaid junior staff and begin to erect paywalls around the websites of its two main metropolitan newspapers, The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age.

The move was met by everybody not going to those website anymore.

The outcomes of the News Corp Australia investigations will be made public, hopefully, in the coming weeks.

PM condemns Aboriginal lifestyles – “I prefer raw onions over witchetty grubs”

TEXT:

After promising to be a “Prime Minister for Aboriginal Affairs”, Tony Abbott has stubbornly persevered through universal condemnation from public figures of all political stripes over his claim that it’s not the taxpayers’ job to subsidise Indigenous Australians’ “lifestyle choices”.

Abbott’s critics are widespread, ranging from Indigenous lawyer, Noel Pearson – all the way to Hollywood with Hugh Jackman posting his support online early this morning. However, the prime minister has remained stern on his views regarding the “pointlessness” traditional Aboriginal lifestyles.

“I mean seriously, what do they see in it? Eating dirty wichitty grubs and charcoaled Kangaroo?”

“It’s like they’ve never experienced chicken schnitzel at the Bavarian Beer Cafe in Manly wharf”

When questioned about his experiences in remote Australian communities, Abbott stated that he “knew enough about the bush” to justify his comments.

“I’ve been out there, it is shit and it is boring. I’ve eaten their so-called bush tucker and it is disgusting. Like, are they are seriously going to get all up in a huff about this? We are doing them a favour”

“I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again. Council housing looks the same wherever you are”

Aside from his casually racist comments, Prime Minister Abbott has been in the headlines quite a lot this last fortnight. With two separate ‘Nazi gaffes’, a cringe-worthy St Patrick’s Day address and two separate instances of him eating a raw onion on camera. Something he commented on today.

“Everyone’s going apeshit about me eating a raw onion. Well, I’d much prefer a raw onion over witchetty grubs. When are these stupid ideas of tradition and culture going to die off?

“It’s pretty obvious that their land is more valuable to us than it is to them. Or should we forfeit billions of dollars in mining just so these people can live on their native lands? I think 60,000 years is long enough, right?”

STUDY: 9 out of 10 people in NSW can’t name opposition leader

TEXT:

A STUDY OF over 1000 people in NSW has concluded that close to 90% of the population didn’t recognise or name the leader of the state Labor Party, Luke Foley.

Foley replaced John Robertson as the leader of the NSW Labor Party after a caucus vote two months ago.

The 44-year-old was elected unopposed after two equally as anonymous rival candidates Michael Daley and Steve Whan, withdrew from the race early on.

As a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council, or the upper house, neither the media nor the public showed great interest in him until he took the top job.

Prior to the NSW Liberal Party winning the 2011 state election, many of the state Labor figures were granted “rockstar” status by the newspapers and television stations – before they were found to be corrupt.

Former New South Wales Labor powerbroker Joe Tripodi was a regular in front of the camera – when he was the Minister for Finance, Infrastructure, Regulatory Reform, Ports and Waterways under former Premier Nathan Rees.

But Tripodi started his political career in the upper house, just like Luke Foley (leader of the NSW Labor Party).

The story is also similar to fellow ICAC alumni and former minister Eddie Obeid, who was elected to the NSW Legislative Council in 1991.

Taking these two shining examples of the finest state Labor politicians into account, Luke Foley has a bright future ahead of him.

According to his Wikipedia entry, Foley only had an image of him added to his page a matter of weeks ago.

Google Trends also outlines that Foley was “a complete unknown” before his accession to the Labor leadership, which can be chalked up to the fact that he’s never had any tangible responsibly within the party. Foley has never been a Minister and he’s never run a government department – therefore detailing why nobody knows who he is.  

In another disturbing trend, radio identity and reality TV show star Chrissie Swan is now outstripping both Mike Baird and Luke Foley in news figures.
Media commentators have credited the spike in Swan’s popularity after Sunrise anchor David Koch made an “off-colour” joke about the 41-year-old being caught smoking while pregnant.

Koch made reference to the fact that “people at work are always ‘bumming’ cigarettes from him” and he “feels like Chrissie Swan because he’s ‘smoking for two’ now”.

The tragedy of this situation is that NSW Labor does have some great policy behind it, such as protecting the state’s electricity network from privatisation and boosting food exports to Asia.

For the first time in a long time, it seems as though NSW Labor has pulled their socks up in terms of engaging the voting public with a range of policy options that, on paper, benefit the overwhelming majority of the NSW population.

Whether or not any other their policy would come to fruition is another thing – because the state is effectively penniless from the last time the people of NSW suffered under a Labor government.

Regardless, it’s almost certain that NSW Labor won’t be letting a look in at this election – not because they’re full of toxic, corrupt and dishonest politicians who only exist to serve themselves, they’ll lose because none of the voters know what their leader’s name is or what he even looks like.

Lazarus resigns from Palmer United to join Canberra Raiders coaching staff

TEXT:

As of this morning, Senator Lazarus, the so-called “brick with eyes” – is the second Australian senator to leave the Palmer United Party after Jacqui Lambie resigned from the party to become an independent in November.

Senator Lazarus, a former professional rugby league superstar, will now serve as an independent senator while also joining the Canberra Raiders coaching staff to “help rectify the damage caused by Sticky (Canberra coach and former teammate of Lazarus, Ricky Stuart)”

In his statement, Senator Lazarus wrote: “This was a difficult decision” but stated that it comes  the fact that his life outside of Parliament house had become less about him and more about the PUP and it’s leader.

“Clive had me working around the clock,”

Lazarus claims he had originally embraced his position in the Palmer United Party, as well as the role of senator. However, upon relocating back to his childhood hometown of Canberra, Lazarus claims that he could see there was “plenty of work to do” in his own backyard.

“The Palmer United Party was great fun for a while there… But when me and the missus ended up back down here in Canberra, we both knew it wasn’t just going to be because of my position as a federal politician,”

“My home team, The Canberra Raiders, have been going through the roughest patch in the club’s history. They really need saving. They need their own Russell Crowe… I knew it was going to have to be me,”

It is alleged that Lazarus approached Clive Palmer last week and requested that the party leader allow him some “down-time” to head into the Raiders sheds and work with struggling coach, Ricky Stuart.

However, it seems that the PUP leader was not too interested in the former Rugby League player’s “dreams of yesteryear”.

“Clive wouldn’t have a bar of it. He said that it wasn’t important enough for me to take time off from work. That really got me fired up,””

“What the fuck does he know about loyalty? I’m here to serve my people first and foremost. I can’t allow my old club to crumble under poor management,”

“Clive told me that rugby league is a simple game for simple men. What the fuck does that even mean?”

Lazarus has revealed that he is “furious” that his past-life as an NRL great is constantly ridiculed in parliament.

“I’d much rather notch NRL premierships with three different clubs over being the idiot that built a shitty Titanic rip-off,”

“As a former Raider, It is my duty to take a break from my role as an Australian senator to help my old club get back on their feet,”

“There is nothing more important than saving the boys and the green machine. Running the country can take a backseat as far as I am concerned. Up The Milk!”

Clive Palmer was unable to speak to The Betoota Advocate this morning but sources close to the mining magnate have stated that the loss of Glenn Lazarus is “water off a ducks back”

“If Laz wants to jeopardise his own legacy, he is more than welcome to. But we won’t allow PUP to be undermined by a rugby leagues has-been’s dreams of yesteryear,”

“Clive has always been a fan of the North Queensland Cowboys, he hates the Raiders with a passion,”

Political commentator Hugh Riminton has taken to twitter to suggest that the PUP is bust-up has more to do with rugby league rivalries then anything else.

“The start of the NRL season has seen the two men grow apart, Glenn is a Raiders icon and a die-hard NSW representative. Clive has always been Maroon-to-the-bone,”

Sources in the Canberra Raiders camp have told the Advocate that Mr Lazarus will assume the role of club wrestling coach and on-field violence trainer.

Andrew Bolt reveals himself as a political satirist, says his whole career was ‘hoax’

TEXT:

WHEN IT COMES to Andrew Bolt, people don’t sit on the fence.

Either you love him, or you hate him.

He’s an award-winning journalist, columnist, radio commentator, blogger and television host that shouts the right-wing agenda from the rooftops.

But what if it all was an act?

It just may be, because last night on 2GB’s Nights with Steve Price, the 55-year-old Adelaidean said that his entire character and professional career is an elaborate satirical hoax.

The roots of these stunning revelations sprouted when a young Bolt discovered improvisational theatre while at university.

“I was lured in by the freedom of expression,” recalled Bolt.

“The movement, the creativity. It was immediately attractive to me,”

“From the moment I saw it, I knew I had to be in it,”

Prior to taking up a cadetship with Melbourne’s The Age in 1979, Bolt was approached by a handful of newspaper and media executives who were interested in creating a satirical voice for the “archaic and fear-mongering” right-wing movement, which had blossomed under the Fraser government.

“Australia was a scary place back then,” said Bolt.

“The conservative factions of both parties had the upper hand and the youth movement was dead,”

“These blokes pulled me aside after class one day and made me an offer I couldn’t refuse,”

At the request of one nameless media executive, Bolt began to attend classes at Sydney’s exclusive National Institute for Dramatic Art (NIDA), where he began to excel.

“When I was at NIDA, I was taught how to capture a character and channel it toward an audience,” said Bolt.

“It was truly eye-opening. It made me want to be an actor,”

“But you know what they say, ‘How do you know if someone’s been to NIDA?'”

“They’ll tell you, don’t worry,”

Bolt began to find his right-wing voice by modelling himself around conservative stalwarts of the Australian media landscape.

He began enthusiastically consuming articles and books from journalists and writers such as Germaine Greer, who’s spiteful and incendiary literature provided Bolt with a firm foundation from which to springboard in to provocative journalism.

“I didn’t much care about what she was saying, but they way she said it was brilliant – it blew me away,” said Bolt.

“The voice in her writing was so full of hate, it was so irrational and baseless,”

“A lot of my early writing was inspired by the way Greer wrote,”

In 2001, Bolt became a regular guest on ABC’s Insiders, which many commentators agree was his breakthrough role.

Appearing in character on television for the first time, Bolt became infamous around Australia for his reaction to the September 11 attacks and the rampant Islamophobia that followed.

“It was a perfect opportunity,”

“There wasn’t a journalist in the country that wanted to touch the growing angst toward Muslims,”

“I decided to go hard after the Muslim population because there was money to be made off the fears of conservatives,” he said.

It was the pseudo-interview that propelled Bolt to nationwide fame.

“People were scared – they were scared of the Muslim running the milk bar down the road,”

“They were all watching me on the television, listening to me on the radio and reading my articles in the newspapers,”

“I was the voice in their head that said: ‘you’re not the only one scared of these people’, which was a lucrative niche to find yourself in,”

By then, Bolt was an established figure within Australian journalism and his name was fast becoming the right-wing brand among the left-leaning progressive élite.

Unions began attacking him, saying he was “anti-business”.

The Greens movement labelling him a “fascist mouthpiece”.

It was a period that Bolt says was difficult.

“Deep down, I’m as left as they come,” he said.

“I’m the son of two Dutch immigrants who had to fight for everything they ever got,”

“I worked hard for my success. And yes it was hard, being called all those things by the people I admired – but I persevered,”

The future of The Bolt Project is now in doubt, now that the agnostic father of three has outed himself but he says he’s not afraid of a new challenge.

“I love to paint,” he revealed.

“My other passion is breeding show spaniels for hunting and competition,”

But even Bolt agrees, now was the best time to end the charade.

“I created this monster that is Andrew Bolt – and I only think it’s right if I’m the one that kills it.”

Has political analyst Tim “Sharky” Ward been hired by Senator Ricky Muir?

TEXT:

MAVERICK SENATOR Ricky Muir was pictured entering parliament yesterday with internet phenomenon, Tim “Sharky” Ward – who’s allegedly been appointed the Victorian’s new foreign policy advisor.

Mr Ward had been an Australian political analyst for a several years, with his insights and opinions read by hundreds of thousands each day.

He’s a fierce critic of Indonesian president Joko Widodo and PM Tony Abbott – but doesn’t align himself with any particular party or school of political thought.

There’s also speculation that Mr Ward ghostwrote Senator Muir’s maiden speech to the upper house, which exceeded the expectations of many.

This comes after the Thailand-based Mr Ward declared that “he wouldn’t come back to Australia until some real blokes got in to power”.

“For far too long, Australia has ‘gone limp’ on foreign policy,” said Mr Ward.

“Does anybody remember when a tiny island nation called New Zealand told the United States to ‘fuck off’ with their nuclear warships?”

“Australia needs to ‘get hard’ and ‘bite back’ at countries that try to have a lend of us.”

Long time Liberal Senator Bill Heffernan thought he’d seen everything – until he saw Mr Ward enter the chamber yesterday.

“First it was a rugby league player, now it’s a former Gold Coast loan shark with more tattoos than an entire prison yard put together,”

“I’ve got nothing against him, though,”

“He’s the only bastard in here with a decent handshake.”

Mr Ward is also a motoring enthusiast himself, boasting a collection of exotic vehicles from Lamborghinis to Porches.

“Trafficking for personal use” – Biggest drug bust in the history of law enforcement

TEXT:

AN ICONIC QUEENSLAND FOOTBALLER has been charged with supplying cocaine and accused of being part of a cocaine trafficking “syndicate” operating in Queensland.

“The CCC will allege the three men and one woman arranged for the supply of cocaine for personal use or to on-supply cocaine to friends and colleagues between June and December 2014.”

It is believed that one of the most recognised sporting talents to ever be produced in Australia is in the cross-hair of an extremely bored police force.

Cocaine, a “recreational drug” – popular amongst lawyers, investment bankers, real estate agents, construction managers, bouncers, entrepreneurs, actors, musicians, politicians, models, labourers, journalists, artists, footballers, hospitality staff, stay-at-home mothers, businessmen, nightclub owners, factory workers, undercover cops, Geoff Huegill and the children of rich people – has been a growing industry on the Gold Coast for many years now.

One cocaine enthusiast has spoken out about the bust.

“I don’t see the point in dragging the name of a tri-code football superstar through the mud,”

“What about me? I am an investment banker… my industry is riddled with coke-feinds – it’s just that none of us are famous enough. A big name makes these cops feel like Elliot Ness” says the man who requested to not be identified.

“We all know who he is. Most of these cops were in high school when he was playing for Queensland. How the fuck can they justify naming him before he even gets to handcuffed?,”

Cocaine – popular amongst lawyers, investment bankers, real estate agents, construction managers, bouncers, entrepreneurs, actors, musicians, politicians, models, labourers, artists, footballers, hospitality staff, stay-at-home mothers, businessmen, nightclub owners, factory workers, undercover cops, Geoff Huegill and the children of rich people – has been a growing industry on the Gold Coast for some time now.

“He’s not even going to court until March. They’ve made this sound like he’s Tony f**king Montana. Realistically, he could have just met the wrong bloke on the wrong night and ended up with the wrong thing in his pocket”

“It’s not like he pissed in his own mouth”

It is believed that the Queensland Police have been extremely bored since the Newman government decided on outlawing motorcycle clubs on the Gold Coast.

A spokesperson for the local bikie club, The Rancid Ninjas, has also given comment.

“Jesus Christ, I knew it wouldn’t stop with us. First they ban us mob, tell us what we can and can’t wear – and tell us what we can and can’t do to earn a crust,”

“Now they are picking on big name footy stars. Who gives a fuck what this bloke and his mates get up to when they are out and about?”

ABC’s Four Corners “unsure” about which industry to cripple next

TEXT:

THE PRODUCERS from ABC’s Four Corners are have revealed that they’re unsure which industry they’d like to derail next.

Earlier this week, the news and current affairs programme aired a story which exposed systematic and brutal cruelty within Australia’s greyhound racing community – which has led to widespread condemnation by both animals rights groups and the public.

The report on live-bating in the greyhound racing scene is expected to trigger a knee-jerk reaction by the government, which will more than likely result in a band-aid solution that appeases the public’s pleas for something to be done.

The Walkley-baiting Four Corners exposé on the abhorrent treatment of Australian cattle in an Indonesian “abattoir” in 2011, forced the Gillard government to effectively wiped-out the entire live export trade between Australia and Indonesia – crippling cattle producers in the northern half of the country.

Jack Verner is the director of the Western Australia Cattleman’s Association.

“Can’t say I’m surprised they’re at it again,” said Mr Verner.

“When will those shiraz-sucking, stubble-bearded, socialist fuckwits in Ultimo learn that their actions have consequences?”

“It’s like we’re dealing with a bunch of children. They just don’t understand. They fucked our industry right up… and now they’re gonna do the same to the greyhound community,”

“It’s irre-fucking-sponsible.” he said.

In the years leading up to the live export ban, over 90% of all cattle in northern Australia were destined to spent their twilight months at Indonesian feedlots.

Nonetheless, the live export ban turned an entire industry on its head overnight, which drastically affected the lives of hundreds of thousands – a phenomenon yet to be seen in greyhound racing as their community begins to implode.

Media commentators and analysts have speculated since Tuesday morning about which industry will be the next to fall in to the ABC’s crosshairs.

Many have suggested that the next head on the chopping block will be the polo associations – which have been known to ride horses with such gusto and vitality that the ponies themselves begin to sweat profusely and pant rapidly.

Polo also lands within two of the ABC’s most popular targets – the wealthy and animal cruelty.

“We’re excited to see what the future holds for us.” said one producer.

Karl Stefanovic and The Betoota Advocate talk shit in Canberra

TEXT:

IT was very kind of Today Show anchor and click bait phenomenon Karl Stefanovic, to find the time to speak to The Betoota Advocate – on what was one of the busiest starts to the political calendar in recent memory.

After touching briefly on the morning’s latest news from inside Parliament House, editors Errol Parker and Clancy Overell were able to speak with the 39-year-old about the glory days of regional journalism.

“You liked the beer and skittles a bit too much,” said Stefanovic, speaking to Clancy Overell.

“I remember being more successful with the backpackers than you were.”

Though the catch-up was fun, albeit short, it was great to see Peter’s brother again and the boys are confident it won’t be the last time they find themselves finding the lighter side of a political disaster with the former Ron Wilson fill-in.

Clive Palmer speaks to Betoota about political corruption – and dingoes

TEXT:

A very successful start to the week saw The Betoota Advocate’s editors making the most of their 28-hour drive to Canberra with an array of timeless interviews.

No one was safe from the gritty journalism that our humble Outback newspaper is famous for – with some of Australia’s biggest and brightest political and media identities being put on blast by Betoota Editors, Errol Parker and Clancy Overell.

One interview in particular, proved to be very important for the people of Betoota.

Clive Palmer, political heavyweight and rightful “King Of The North” spoke to Betoota about all the things that concern our neighbours in the Queensland Channel Country. Our dingo problem, North Queensland’s need to break away and what he says is an example of deep-seeded political corruption within  the ranks of the LNP.

Mr Palmer wasn’t afraid to speak his mind on all the big issues affecting regional Queenslanders.

#BetootaLive: Breaking news from Parliament House

TEXT:

Prime minister Tony Abbott has declared the Liberal leadership speculations are now over, after he survived the crucial secret ballot vote in the party room this morning.

Liberal MPs voted 61 to 39 against making the leader’s position vacant to contenders.

Media commentators have suggested the result was set in stone after a long weekend working the phones – making backdoor deals and silent partnerships.

Meanwhile, The Betoota Advocate‘s editors were invited in to the media pack outside the front of Parliament House by some powerful old friends from the early days.

After a gruelling 28-hour drive down from the desert country, our reporters were “shoo-ed” away from the House of Representatives entrance by the Australian Federal Police.

Taking it in their stride, editors Clancy Overell and Errol Parker spoke to a variety of Australian political identities to try to see what they thought about what was going on inside the party room.

The Editors first spoke with a passionate Young Liberal member, who urged party members to “give the bloke a go”.

It was the scoop that opened the floodgates as some of the nation’s biggest media and political heavyweights formed an orderly queue – waiting for their opportunity to be interviewed by the “softly-spoken desert-dwelling journalists” from Betoota.

Great to meet the “reporters” from the @BetootaAdvocate today pic.twitter.com/9TcqcGJCEg

Veteran political mind and host of ABC’s Insiders, Barrie Cassidy, was keen to hear from the boys as they brought him up to speed with what this morning meant for Australia.

As the interview with Mr Cassidy wrapped up, co-anchor of Channel 9’s Today Show and Betoota proponent Karl Stefanovic  was next to step up to the plate – where he reminisced about his early days as cadet reporters up north with Errol and Clancy.

Mining magnate and rule bender, Clive Palmer asked his driver to stop the Bentley as he noticed the boys wrapping an interview nearby. In a whistle-stop talk, Mr Palmer professed his enthusiasm for rural affairs and declared that he always puts regional Australia atop his personal to-do list – the rightful King of the North Country.

This is just a small sample of the interviews The Betoota Advocate were able to secure, simply by being the only independent media present in the Parliament House press pack.

The Daily Telegraph forced to defend itself against support for Tony Abbott allegations

TEXT:

THE DAILY Telegraph has been called out by media commentators for “trying to muster support for Tony Abbott’s leadership”.

As the leader’s popularity is still in free fall, every media outlet in the country is trying to distance themselves from the 57-year-old Roman Catholic.

Yesterday’s cover of the Telegraph was predominately dominated with an image of the prime minister, with the headline: “Over my dead body”.

Just above the cover story, a similar tone was taken for the headline of a story about Daly Cherry-Evan’s alleged departure from the Manly Sea Eagles, using the headline: “Keep him at all costs”.

These fresh and shocking allegations were levelled by senior editorial staff at ABC News, who say that it’s a disturbing example of cheque book journalism.

“It’s unacceptable for a media outline such as The Telegraph to show any bias,” said one ABC dignitary.

“There would be blood running down Harris Street if we, the ABC, showed any bias towards a political figure,”

“To put it bluntly, News Limited has too much “conservative driftwood” in it – they should clean out the old guard and replace them with young and irresponsibly under-qualified journalists.” she said, without help from her patriarchal bosses.

Editorial staff at The Telegraph have hit back at the allegations.

“If you want to know why something is happening, follow the money,” said one Telegraph journalist.

“The ABC have to toe a company line just the same as we do.”

“It’s just that a ‘pinko’ Labor government gives them too much money and a Coalition one gives them just what they need – and no more,” he said.

The Daily Telegraph is expected to publish a retraction and an apology on page 113 in tomorrow’s edition.

PM Tony Abbott unveils “Labor dirt file” during National Press Club address

TEXT:

THE Prime Minister says he’s in possession of a “Labor dirt file” and plans to use it to discredit the opposition when parliament returns next Monday.

Uncovered by staff at the National Library of Australia, the “secret dossier” contains details of party infighting and dissent among both cabinet ministers and backbenchers.

Mr Abbott says the portfolio offers a rare and contemporary insight in to the current workings of the Opposition.

“This book was handed to me by my Chief-of-Staff over the weekend,” said the PM.

“It’s contents are very disturbing – it shows just how unqualified the Labor party is,”

“Once the coalition makes this material public under the Freedom of Information Act 1982, nobody in good conscience would vote for them.”

Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten says that the information that the government has claimed to have “uncovered” was already publicly available.

Shorten says this could prove to be the straw that breaks the camel’s back as it’s been revealed today that the Duke of Edinburgh turned down Abbott’s Knighthood, stating that he has no interested in accepting an “Austrian” honour – because “those bastard’s gave us nothing but ghastly chocolate and Hitler”.

“I implore the prime minister to republish The Latham Diaries,” said Mr Shorten.

“First he decides to give the Duke of Edinburgh a knighthood – who then confused us with Austria,”

“Maybe I should just take the kids skiing in Japan for a few weeks? He’s doing my job for me.”

Miley Cyrus, Bob Dylan “leak” nudes to coincide with upcoming album releases

TEXT:

INTERNATIONAL pop sensation Miley Cyrus and underground hero Bob Dylan have both had intimate photos leaked – just days before their albums go on sale.

Shockingly, representatives for Dylan have yet to answer requests for comment. The 73-year-old’s Instagram account and Twitter have fallen silent in the past 12 hours as his team goes in to damage control.

On the flip side, Cyrus’s PR machine has gone in to overdrive as they look to capitalise on this unfortunate situation.

Media commentators and analysts have questioned whether these leaks were deliberate, as both artists have upcoming releases.

“Bob Dylan is better known for his social media presence,” said one analyst.

“That’s what’s profitable these days, though. Not many artists today have the integrity and appeal of Miley Cyrus.” he said.

Dylan’s latest release will feature no original compositions, which is a far cry from Cyrus’s so-far-untitled next album.

Instead, the album consists of covers of traditional pop standards made famous by Frank Sinatra, chosen by Dylan himself.

Not much is known about Miley Cyrus’s next album, other than it will be a compilation of “disjointed singles” which is being produced by Quincy Jones.

The 22-year-old singer-songwriter has come a long way after shooting to fame with her debut hit “You’re Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go”  – as the once squeaky clean teenage role model has recently been spending more time taking pictures of her nipples than time spent writing songs.

TMZ.com revealed this morning that Cyrus was inspired to take topless pictures of herself after seeing Bob Dylan do the same on a Malibu Beach.

“Every singer working today in America can be traced back to Bob Dylan,” said Cyrus.

“His influence is everywhere,”

Recent crash in oil price forces ISIS to use stolen hybrid vehicles

TEXT:

THE Islamic State is reportedly being forced to start using hybrid vehicles as their fuel supply begins to run out.

Since July, the US has been targeting oil infrastructure inside ISIS-controlled Iraq and Syria to remove their capability to refine oil in to fuel.

Toyota has been planning a diesel-electric version of its popular Hilux model since 2007 but plans were halted after concerns were raised about the weight and reliability of the four-wheel-drive.

Late last year, the Japanese car maker said it was trialing “hybrid off-road vehicles” in the Jordanian desert before they were stolen by ISIS over the new year – with the global company yet to comment on the high-stakes heist.

While the global price of oil continues to plummet, the group is boasting a $2 billion budget for the coming year — with a $250 million surplus.

The collapse of oil prices has spelt terrible news for ISIS. The terrorist group, which captured oil fields in Iraq and Syria, has been allegedly selling oil through proxies on the black market.

However, the market for black market oil is no longer a profitable one due to the recent price crash.

This has effectively forced ISIS out of the global oil industry – causing an over-supply of unrefined crude oil in the caliphate.

The Washington Times reported in September that a Pentagon official, speaking anonymously, claimed nineteen of about twenty oil refineries controlled by the Islamic State in eastern and northern Syria were “liberated” by airstrikes.

With theses latest developments in Syria, this claim seems to have some substance has the Islamic State scrambles to refine its own oil.

Oil fields are not on the U.S. target list, because “the fossil fuel resources belong to the Syrian people, and they would likely suffer long-term damage and a decline in their productive capacity – an industry pivotal to rebuilding the region post-ISIS,” and there is also concern about the environmental damage that this would cause, Foreign Policy reported last week.

The hybrid off-roaders apparently have a curb weight of over two-and-a-half tonnes but can allegedly travel a thousand kilometres on a single 225 litre tank.

Officials from Toyota are eagerly awaiting confirmation.

The fuel supply issue within the Islamic State is expected to intensify in the coming months as ISIS officials try to come up with a solution.

MH370 and AirAsia mysteries trigger worldwide shortage of tin foil

TEXT:

30 December, 2014. 13:09

THE LATEST DISAPPEARANCE of an airliner is causing a worldwide shortage of tin foil as millions around the world begin fashioning hats made from the malleable metal.

The hats have entered vogue with everyday people as the latest airline vanishing has made it socially acceptable to harbour even the most wild conspiracy.

Traditionally, tin foil hats are worn in the belief it shields the brain from threats such as electromagnetic fields, mind control, and mind reading.

The number of people choosing to wear the hats is growing each day – as many conspiracy theorists believe that governments or aliens are responsible for the air travel disasters.

The notion that a tin foil hat can significantly reduce the intensity of incident radio frequency radiation on the wearer’s brain has some scientific validity, as the effect of strong radio waves has been documented for quite some time.

Dr Michael Gamble from the CSIRO says, however, that the effectiveness of a tin foil hat is greatly decreased if it is not a full enclosure.

“For a ‘tin foil hat’ to be truly effective, it would be best for one to entirely encapsulate oneself in the tin foil.” said Gamble.

A well-constructed tin foil enclosure would approximate a Faraday cage, reducing the amount of (typically harmless) radiofrequency electromagnetic radiation passing through to the interior of the structure.

Last week, a former French airline CEO speculated that the US military may have targeted MH370 because they feared a September 11-style attack on a military base in the Indian Ocean.

Marc Dugain, who headed Proteus Airlines and is an established author, suggested an article for French magazine Paris Match, he claimed that the Boeing 777 crashed nowhere near where international search teams have been combing the ocean for wreckage, but near an American military base in the British territory of Diego Garcia.

“It’s an extremely powerful military base. It’s surprising that the Americans have lost all trace of this aircraft. Without getting into conspiracy theories, it is a possibility that the Americans stopped this plane.” said Dugain.

After Dugain made these statements, tin mining and exploration companies worldwide began noticing that the demand for tin was starting to outstrip supply.

“We’re currently operating at 104% capacity,” says Fred Ridge, lead geologist at AusTin.

“Right now, the rising popularity of tin foil hats is unsustainable.”

Early reports of the MH17 disaster suggested over 100 people working in the field of HIV/Aids research, en route to a major international conference in Melbourne, had perished.

When a clearer picture emerged, this was revised down to seven. No less horrific for those who perished or their friends and family, but perhaps less grist to the mill of those who speculated that the plane had been shot down to prevent a cure for HIV/AIDS being revealed.

Conspiracy theories are nothing new. As Tim Mendham from the pro-science Australian Skeptics group told The Advocate, governments shot down MH17 because the CIA created the AIDS virus to depopulate Africa and homosexual communities and a passenger on that plane had a cure.

He is also a firm proponent of the tin foil hat, saying they’re a necessity in modern life.

“They shot down the plane because they had the cure for the HIV on it [sic],” said Mendham.

“Rather than help modernise Africa, they want it to be sustainable so they just give them AIDS – which they do by injecting infected blood in to mosquitoes in farms then drop them in to places like Africa and Darlinghurst  to give Africans and gay people HIV,”

“The only reason why people think I’m wrong is because my tin foil hat blocks the Abbott radio waves which allows me to think independently.”

Mr Mendham is also an avid “Corby Truther”, suggesting that Schappelle Corby was set up by the Australian government.

The supply and price of tin is expected to drop sharpley once wreckage of AirAsia Flight QZ8501 is discovered and a credible reason why it crashed is established.

Turnbull government rebrand Christmas Island as “The Next Koh Phangan”

TEXT:

THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT is funding a campaign in accordance with the WA Tourism Council to rebrand Christmas Island as a family holiday and party destination.

In a move similar to the one that brought new life to Rottnest Island, the campaign will focus heavily on the island’s natural beauty and ecological importance.

As the fallout continues from the Abbott Government’s violations of international law on both Nauru and Manus Island, the federal government is looking to brighten its outlook on immigration policy.

Minister for Immigration, Peter Dutton MP, says the spotlight needs to be shifted from the detention facility to what Christmas Island offers both culturally and ecologically. The Turnbull Government looks to promote the Indian Ocean community as a low-key island destination, where no one needs to know what’s you are getting up to.

“Many Australians are starting to learn what anthropologists and naturalists have known for decades,” says Mr Morrison.

“Christmas Island is one of the most beautiful places on Earth,”

“However, there’s a capacity to establish a small arts festival on the Island to stimulate the local economy – similar to Thailand’s Koh Phangan or Koh Phi Phi,”

“All of the bad press coming from Christmas Island is frankly unfair because it detracts from what the island actually is – Gorgeous.” says Mr Morrison.

The tourist mecca of Broome is only a short seventeen-hour plane trip via Perth or a twelve-hour ferry ride from the remote island, prompting intrepid travel agencies to market the destination as the “outback of the ocean”.

“Christmas Island could be the new Koh Phangan or Koh Phi Phi,” says Broome-based travel agent Melinda Card.

“Earlier this year, a few cool and popular bands played a couple gigs or Rottnest [Island]. Perhaps Christmas Island could play host to its own party festival in the future?”

“People travel from all over the world to go to Full Moon Party in Thailand – Christmas Island would be perfect for it.” says Ms Card.

Perth-based agency Catfish Creative won the campaign contract, beating out over a hundred other agencies around the country.

“Christmas Island is one of nature’s most impressive feats,” says Catfish director Simon Greyface.

“With so many endemic species, the island is often referred to as the Galapagos of the Indian Ocean. Yet it also displays a curious collection of cultures, history and industry, emerging as a place where all these elements create a truly unusual travel experience,”

“It’s also the kind of destination where smoking a joint or ingesting a harmless party drug like GHB won’t get you placed in front of a firing squad,”

“I just hope Australia has grown to see this – to look past its controversial use as an immigration processing and detention site.” says Mr Greyface.

Catfish’s other accounts include Bluescope Steel, Mineralogy, The Liberal Party of Australia, BHP Billiton, Fortescue Metals Group and The Royal Flying Doctor Service.

The campaign will begin early next year.

Karl Rips Into Abbott “I Wouldn’t Fucking Trust You With My Wife At My Wedding”

TEXT:

If you haven’t seen it, YOU NEED TO SEE IT.

This morning on the Today show, co-host Karl Stefanovic appeared to reach boiling point with the illusive Tony Abbott.

In a video that has since been removed from all forms of online media, Karl Stefanovic took it up to Mr Abbott, after he said he wished “the Labor Party wasn’t in such a feral mood” over helping repair the budget.

“With respect, you were fairly feral in Opposition weren’t you, I mean the greatest respect by that, and … why would [Bill Shorten] do anything different when it worked for you?” Stefanovic asked.

“The reality is here that the budget position is in a shambles and every day it does get worse,” the Channel Nine host went on.

“It’s not in a shambles Karl,” Mr Abbott hit back.

“No one is buying what you are selling, what you are laying down. That is the problem,” Stefanovic replied.

The Prime Minister insisted that the “budget started to come under control the day the government changed”.

“Now, I don’t pretend that this parliament has been easy for us, not for a second do I pretend this parliament is easy for us, but we have already made substantial changes.”

But it didn’t end there, with Mr Abbott asked whether he was “worried” that he might be a “one-term wonder”.

Karl Stefanovic venomously dug in the boot with a verbal spray that showed a far more political-charged side to the television personality.

“Mate, you’ve got rocks in your head if you think we are buying your shit. I spend each day of my life answering to the greasiest media executives you’ve ever met… I would still take their word over yours. I wouldn’t f**king trust you with my wife at my wedding!”

Abbott responded quite sternly to Stefanovic’s outburst

“Just remember who you are talking to, Karl”

Karl returned fire once again

“I know exactly who I’m talking to. A backward, bank worshipping, concrete cowboy. You are nothing more than a former amateur boxer… But you act like you’ve taken as many hits to the head as Fenech. I’m sorry Tony, but I don’t like being lied to.”

Karl Stefanovic then removed himself from the set while the Prime Minister was still on the air. He is yet to comment publicly on the outburst.

Senator Leyonhjelm supports Zimbabwe coup d’état

TEXT:

FEDERAL SENATOR DAVID Leyonhjelm says he will support any action to overthrow Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe.

“The Coalition should be doing more to destabilise the Mugabe regime by any means necessary,” says Senator Leyonhjelm.

“Whether it be through diplomatic channels or with the SAS and JDAMS – I don’t really care,”

Senator Leyonhjelm dramatically left the Liberal Party in 1996 after the Howard government clamped down hard on gun legislation after the Port Arthur massacre. Last year, he was elected to the upper house were he represents the Liberal Democrat Party – the first libertarian senator in Australia’s history.

However, some pundits have questioned whether directly targeting the president of another country for assassination really falls in line with the principles of libertarianism. According to UNSW Professor of Political Science, Ray Shelvich, the motifs and themes of libertarianism do, in fact, support what Senator Leyonhjelm is proposing to do.

“The weird thing about libertarianism is that it’s a school of thought that fosters anarchy,” says Professor Shelvich.

“So by the same token, if the Senator wants Robert Mugabe killed, he’s perfectly entitled to feel that way – under his own school of though.”

Earlier this week, Senator Leyonhjelm made it very clear to journalists how he felt on the matter.

“My policy when dealing with these kinds of people is always the way of the gun,”

Josh Thomas linked to “anti-gay” ABC show

TEXT:

#BREAKING #NITV #ABC #SBS #BBAU

FRESH FROM his overnight Twitter battle with Liberal MP Wyatt Roy, Josh Thomas has been accused of “not reading the fine print” after signing on to host an allegedly “anti-gay” reality TV show.

The television creation is set to be the first show of it’s type to feature on the ABC, with the bulk of the production funding coming from government coffers.

The plan has faced immediate scrutiny from community leaders and the opposition – and The Greens.

“At this point in time, most of the nation isn’t even shocked by this,” says Greens MP Scott Ludlam.

“The scary thing is that Australian’s have grown accustomed to this kind of rampant neo-fascism from the Abbott Administration,”

“They think it’s normal.”

What alarms critics is the premise of the show – eleven gay men and one straight man are locked in a house, Big Brother style.

The object of the show is for the gay men to find out who isn’t gay.

Once a week, someone gets voted out and if the gays manage to vote him out – they claim the one million dollar prize.

If the straight man is among the two last people in the house, the prize is doubled to two million dollars.

Producers have revealed the twist will be that NONE of the men are actually gay, they all just think that they’re the one straight man.

Therefore, the 30-minute episodes will feature straight men “acting” as homosexuals.

The Government hopes that this TV programme will outline and prove the opinion of the party that homosexuality is a lifestyle choice and not a genetic predisposition.

“We’ve commission this television production to show all Australian’s that homosexuality is a treatable condition and that gay people are effectively acting to conform to a lifestyle,” says Liberal MP Wyatt Roy.

“My parents and even my grandparents never had any gay friends. Now they’re everywhere.”

“I’m just not that sure why Josh Thomas agreed to lend his name to it. That’s a bit odd.” says Mr Roy.

The Advocate approached Mr Thomas for comment but have yet to receive a reply.

The currently untitled production is slated to begin production before the end of the month.
