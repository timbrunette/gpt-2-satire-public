Local Woman’s ‘Controversial Opinion’ Surprisingly Not Half As Interesting As Ipswich Town Ipswich mayor

TEXT:

In what can only be described as a surprisingly uninteresting day for Australian women, local television presenter, Wendy Darche, on Wednesday night aired a segment exploring the life of Ipswich mayor, Wazza Tyson.   

The segment, which aired yesterday and has had a far more run of the mill bumper sticker headlines than any other Ipswich-based media presenters, outlined how controversial the area is in regards to Ms Darche’s controversial opinions on the Islamic community.

One headline concerns the current Islamic community head up.

TODAY it’s rumoured as gospel that Wazza Tyson is the reincarnation of Jesus’ mother, or as the church would describe her, ‘Controversial Opinion’.

While Mr Tyson refuses to say the name and says his address is correct, as does every Australian Islamic is, in all likelihood, a Muslim one, his segment delves deeper into the roots of the ‘R.M.S’ controversy that is Australia Day and the subsequent ban on Muslims taking part in the celebration.

It is not yet known what prompted the segment starting, other than maybe they are getting old.

Father-In-Law Emasculpts Next Mate By Name In Passing Conversation

TEXT:

The local priests at the Betoota Ponds General Office have have spent a flushed head this afternoon looking for some token of ayrgical friendship with the local son. 

This comes after the young men were forced to reveal that they are both 24 and living in London at the moment and have two European wives who’s children are also the subject of a rumour. 

After the first question, a polite and happy-go-lucky Leo gave their inquisitive team a few minutes to find the 31-year-old first name. 

From there, they gave him the run down.

Namely,

Name?

Emmet’s name?

No.

What did they get?

A couple of frags later, the odd-looking Leo in a hospital bed name with a serious band-aid covering the bridge has just stubbed out his pinky and is now warm and soft. 

After the first few minutes of this intense close combat, the boys have unable to shake the embarrassment. 

The Advocate managed to sit down with Peter, a local primary educator, to gain some more detail on what he was planning on doing next. 

“Yeah, just goes over my head,” he said. 

“For example, you know what’s this? This magazine? This flash drive? Yeah we can give you these, but you need to keep an eye on me, I don’t want to wake you up in bed with a wet bedsheet.” 

“Right,” Peter nodded. 

When asked what else he was looking at, he laughed awkwardly. 

“Yeah, what can I get away with for now? I’m not stupid.” 

“What if I look like a real estate agent? Like in Overseas Houses?” 

“Well, that’s the only chance I’ll ever want to buy a house again.”

Law Clerk Repeatedly Pressured Into Filling Bags By Unwanted Text Messages From Account Scientists

A local law clerk’s repeated requests for a use bag during an expected work day conversation is science denialists.

Speaking exclusively to The Advocate this morning, Lucy Montague-Smith, a junior solicitor in Betoota’s law department, said she was repeatedly told to take the blame for not doing more to prevent the recent Paris attacks and the like.

“I’m just, you know, used up all those silly hold ups they pump out every single day, you’ve got to blame themselves,” she said.

“Yalla’d wanna blame me for not doing this. What was my understanding of the French people like? They’re as dumb as a box of rocks. Yalla gave them the finger as to why I wasn’t doing more to prevent the attacks. Yalla what?”

“I’m the one who needs to take the blame,” she said.

But Lucy said she couldn’t because she’d noticed a vein in her work email that she didn’t want to encourage.

“I’m the one who needs to take the blame,” she said.

So in the moments since the news broke, Lucy hasnearly took the blame.

Speaking exclusively to The Advocate, she said she deleted her email account after one unread message from a user interested in buying a used AstraBond at 40 cents.

“I can’t deal. I can’t deal,” she said.

“What am I supposed to do? Write a cheque about something like this? I can’t file it.”

Nation’s Pubs To Heave With Guilt-Free Husbands Tonight As Gilmore Girls Returns To TV

TEXT:

For the first time in many years, majority of Australia’s married men and woman will make their television appearances tonight on ABC, the nation’s entertainment industry has confirmed.

In an industry first announced in 1996, today’s TV ad was the first to air from inside a camera, so a large majority of Australians are willing to pay $1 million per view for this momentous moment.

Local public Relations Manager, Debbie Colby says it’s a black and white moment for Australian men.

“It’s like the moment a grey-haired whinger turns 18, it’s always black and white again”

“The fact that Robocop finally does it justice is one of the highlights of tonight’s broadcast… Which is depressing for sure, because it’s kind of like the halcyon days of our gay and Muslim brothers in suits, in terms of what they can expect in their professional life afterwards”

“The fact that David Jones still has a big bucket for women ‘cos that’s for sure”

While the commercial network can rest a bit of their ducks in the water for this television ad, the female nudity, and the fact that even the very television producers are out of their depth) – without really giving too much away – is certainly enough to send these young men’s heads inside.

Robbie* (name-changed), a well-known regional sporting superstar and self-described politically motivated ‘out-of-shape’ man, says the long-haired baby boomer has always been keen for a News Corp presentation that isn’t in-depth and actually quite shoddy.

“I don’t know, mate. It’s pretty tired when you get older”

“Like News Corp presenting is in some sense a more in-depth presentation than News Corp putting on in. We just don’t want to give News Corp anymore money for a number of reasons”

“The same goes with all the online stuff”

“Like with Cricket – they always want to be the Cricket News, so they’ve always been more in-touch with the fans”

“But it doesn’t mean I’ll come back for another edition of the Ladbrokes Paper”

Bloke Who Doesn’t Known Anyone At Party Shows Off Unique Skills With Sausage Roll

After six months of investigation, police in South Betoota have today revealed the ‘full-on’ of a local alpaca farmer’s unique skill set he just had to summon to a table.

“We summoned the alpacaman to the pokies around early last week and he just wanted to get on with the job,” said Detective Gary Needham.

“He’s charming as hell and all, but a few words or nothing is kind of funny. I wanted to test him on his hearing,”

“And by some twist of cruel fate, I actually was. He just had to meet Sam six weeks ago for the drive home,”

Sam is now going to Betoota Heights with his new best man, who he described as a ‘sweet, innocent and hard work.’

“It was pretty weird,” he said.

Katter Calls For $120m Plebiscite On Whether Crocs Should Be Slain By Fraser Intervention

TEXT:

One of Queensland’s biggest Koch-owned environmental groups have today confirmed that they will continue to fight to protect the iconic Australia’s ducks and marine turtles, even when the Fraser Intervention is brought before them.

The Three Lions Party (KL), a major water profit organisation in the Coral Sea) have today ruled out the idea of a Federal Government over the fishlife as far as Queensland is concerned.

“At this point in time, the best way for us to keep the river water is to pay the most tax possible, even though we don’t pay it in any form of tax whatsoever,” said Katter.

“Even when we clear the century-old whaling whodabrie like we do in Western Queensland, we get the ball rolling on the frisbee and throw the squid into the creek below,”

“I’ll be honest, the only people who think they’re above politics are hot chicks from the local cotton-growing belt like me. I can’t say that without looking like a Goncago.”

Lattice and farmers groups have called for an intervention, as bothactions are weak and irrelevant, after both the Fraser Government and the Akubra Council made their position on the Gillard government’s fiscal responsibility as it passes.

While many on the fringes of the Katter family see the fiscal responsibility as the primary driver of Queensland’s economy, others see it as more more subtle and sporting.

“I just don’t get it. Fraser was the one who was spending it wisely, by being a kanga bloke,” said patriarch Kevin Katter, who has been farming in the New South Wales area for nearly three decades.

“When you throw all that shit at the population and it doesn’t work,”

“And let’s be honest, he’s done a real poor van Gogh. There’s no question about that,”

“But the primary driver of the state is the kanga bloke,”

At time of press, Kevin was seen playing hackey sack with some sort of bamboo that looked like deodorant.

Man Wearing Fox Racing Flat Cap Lies And Says He’s Never Glassed Someone

TEXT:

An outer Betootan local has today lied through his teeth as to his sexual experience as a member of the Australian Federal Police.

Fitzroy Capricorn, or ‘Crouchie’ as he is known in the his native Geelong,  lied to his mates about his experience in the Australian justice system, and even tried to make them look as though he’s never been in trouble for doing so.

However, while many of the boys in the wider Geelong community knew Capricorn as the father of ‘Crouchie’ – who’s name escaped Mr Ponsford – others didn’t want to believe it.

The 29-year-old man, who goes by the name of Greg, spoke to the fact that he was never really sure if he had been admitted to a local university or not – and the fact that he’s always seemed to wear a Fox Racing cap like the rest of his mates.

“I’ve never been in trouble for doing so” he said.

“When I was studying for my history, I got pulled aside by the lecturer and he told me that it’s just like any other job. The famous Australian pic.”

“He tried to explain to me every single thing that I haven’t seen in the news in decades”

As Mr Ponsford sat there with his head held high in his hands, he couldn’t help but shake with the contempt shown to his cowardice.

The Brisbane based roofing contractor said he’s seen work in the US, Europe and Australia being called “perverts and crumbs” and “perverts” for saying things like, “You cannot judge a book by its cover” and, “The Australian people do not deserve to see such degenerates treated”.

“We Need To Switch To Renewables Now” Malcolm Turnbull Tells Volleyball With The Swimming Dams

TEXT:

Former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has taken to social media this morning to voice his opposition to the US president’s plans to abandon his war on coal and other fossil fuels.

“We’re going to be voting to keep the coal, we’re going to be voting to keep our coal,” he wrote in the Facebook post.

In what some political analysts are calling the “whistle-blower issue”, Turnbull has been fighting internal battles today among his more conservative colleagues in the Liberal Party about where to put the Swimming Dams – which he says is a source of increased stress for the 40-year-old.

“I’ve got a lot of things on my to-do list, but none of them are as important as environment and food affordability,” he said.

The controversial Swimming Dams are a sure-fire way for households with young kids to get a run-down idea about how much they are paying for their homes, and to stay in school. 

But critics say the new election campaign, and the swimmership, has been quite complex and prone to ambiguity.

The Advocate reached out to a number of high schoolers, one of which was wearers, to figure out what they thought about Mr Turnbull’s plans to scrap the national electricity system and what steps they would take to secure the future of our nation.

One of them was Sam Frisian (15), from Norwood in Sydney’s east.

“I don’tbs are abuzz!” he posted alongside a photo of the bins that had landed outside his brother’s harbourside Californian bungalow.

“I wondered if the missus was going to throw the shits on me or what. Now I know who I’m going to be wearing for next month”

“Fuck sake, I think this is a bit of a bitch!”

“Well, rather than what you’re wearing now, you honestly believe that you’re a fucking quack teenager.”

Sam spoke to our reporters privately on the way back to the Caspian capital to see if he was still wearing his Budgy Smugglers t-shirt and if he was still wearing his house magisterial Greenies cap that his brother Bill wore to high school.

“Absolutely not,” he said.

“That’s putting in your head like a cricket player at a boundary four!”

Sam then got up and walked out of the room to the barber’s office, returning a short time later to find Peter Hanks there with a concussion.

He told our reporters he didn’t remember seeing the ‘D’ on the day he fractured Hanks’ skull in the middle of the day.

Mr Hanks is currently on paid leave with owing to his hospitalisation, or lack thereof, nearly two weeks ago.

After testing his hair at university, a local salesman has revealed that it appears to be 100% testable after 18 months of dryness.

After wearing a coat for three months, Matthew Green said it was “testing at peace” – but wasn’t over it completely.

“I was always pretty sunburnt after 18 months, and my hair is really fair-haired, but it’s not,” he said.

“My old, red-stained eyelids always pecked the me when I was drying, you know. So I was like, ‘fuck this, I’m not drying, I’m gonna have to wet my whole face!’ But yeah, it’s testing.”

While the salesman was at it again and cutting the hair of some drop-behind-the-ring university student, the results were surprisingly different to what they currently are.

“I’ve had more curly than Levi, but that’s for another article, now.”

Sydney Real Estate Claims To Be Exhausted After Big Week Of Smiling And Opening Doors

TEXT:

10 October 2016. 12:25

Prospective home buyers, Sally Simpson and Tony Johnstone had their Saturday morning ruined by a real estate agent who could not stop going on about how busy he is. 

Making the trip from Betoota out to Sydney the pair was simply trying to find a new home and a change of scenery. 

Instead, the young parents have had to hear at great length how the real estate agent – who is yet to be formally accepted by the property market – has “honestly shacked up” with work colleagues.

With no realisation the two young parents have been living this way for the better part of a day or so.

The real estate agent, as it appears his “coach Tony” has been working hard to remove any real sense of security he had in his young family by claiming to be pregnant.

With the quick life hacks and face makes now taking into account any potential income he might have in the coming weeks and days, the real estate agent has no option other than to claim that he is getting a big deposit from a big hide.

“I’m not getting a salary.”

“I’m getting nothing for my investment but a handout from the government, and a heart massage.”

With his pupils filled with what he might do in the real estate market, Tony says the real estate agent is just putting it all on hold to get the deposit he needs.

“What do you reckon? He’s going to massage this week and look after young lives.”

“I reckon he’ll feel some self-respect for it but wait there. I count to ten.”

Man Can’t Help But Laugh At The Fucking State Of This Planet As He Walks To Work In Shorts

TEXT:

A man in his mid-40s has given his all to charity today by sprinting through a checkout in shorts and a Puma t-shirt as he makes his way to his car in the local French Quarter.

It is believed that Alistair Hunt, who experienced the stride of a nervous adulterer currently on the run in Queensland, made a the painful decision to jump on the discounting website Quasimodo.

It is believed that as a result of the spikey stretchy button down on the A to G of his shopping cart, Alistair was forced to make a booking at the Lido Dick Shop in the Pudong Quarter, use his preferred online shopping cart, and return back to the Woolworths at Coles in his semi-retired late model Toyota Kluger.

Mr Hunt, who has been known to board the t-rex just before he made his way into the Woolworths car park, told The Advocate that he could not be happier.

“I’m happy to be you. I just had my life this afternoon, and I’ve made a mistake. Happy I’m not now,” he said.

The casual Whooton School local, who made the booking as a full-time student at the local TAB, was not taken too seriously by the Woolworths employees who claims he spends most of his time ‘walking in piss’ in his pajamas.

Witnesses say Alistair’s outfit does notitute clothing for his suburban bachelor lifestyle which is one of the reasons he has chosen to not go to Woolworths.

“He does not feel comfortable around other people,” said one person who was standing behind Alistair in the carpark.

“It is what it is. A favour to the throat. If he wanted to get the little hands job, he would have taken it easier. But no. I will take the TAB Job.”

Thousands Of Disengaged Adult Sons Rush To Buy Dad The Betoota Book For Christmas

TEXT:

With over 60,000 units of The Betoota Advocate’s new book sold in just 48 hours, the race is on for thousands of disengaged adult sons across the nation to secure their copy of an old, unabridged Betoota bestseller.

The Betoota Advocate’s first priority is to provide a safe and entertaining experience for our consumer son’s who don’t want to abandon their families and money to pursue a life outside work – but that’s not all.

“I can just assure you, Dad will be in no hurry to return his book,” said a mildly popular disengaged adult son who spoke on condition of anonymity.

“No tradie, no silver dog. Just my opinion. He’ll be in no hurry, either. He can’t go back and read anymore than his 6 pm notes to the bus or he can until the cows come home. I’ll get him a nice silver copy of John Upjohn’s ‘Windranger’ if that’s what he asks,”

“If he wants to read anything by W. W. K. Rowling, no problem ‘wizard’. But if he wants to read a fair few of Joyce’s work, he needs to wait until March, before any of the new laws he’s written are published.”

However, despite reaching out to the Minister for the Marginalised, we managed to get the book for free, in the book.

For $5.00 Joyce donated the total amount of money he had to the government from his unsuccessful efforts in politics to a sitting Prime Minister to be forced into the crosshair, to be elected into the House of Representatives.

“I didn’t have much,” he admitted.

“Turning my back on the Commonwealth was difficult but I’m committed to doing it soon. Labor was harder, I guess”

“The book will be published in Australia on Kindle in a fortnightly back-to-back. It’s a fantastic book.”

“I’m a cryptocurrency expert but I don’t have anything to invest in but my bank and local council say I’m worth $20m. If that doesn’t change, I’ll start my own business entirely.”

Peter Brock, who now has his hands in various multi-national and small business including Le Creuset, bought his own house in the French Quarter earlier this week. It was initially he thought, but as he renewed his banking relationships with people he’s never met before, he realised the odds were against him.

“I just wanted to get my income over 50% because all the negative gearing tax cuts have cost me $50k each,” he said.

“But the market I had was $450 a week less bad news. It’s not the whole picture, if you just look at the month in July I was paying $300 a week in tax, that’s actually got me in serious hot water.”

But Brock has already taken steps to get back on his feet.

Last night he purchased a property.

“This is the money I need to start my own business. Having a house of your own in this shire is a bit of fun, money like I was never about rent or anything, I’m just constantly adding value,”

“I’m definitely going to start my own business. Absolutely not a direct service like credit cards or bank accounts. I think they might be necessary, I know a fair few people just hooked into the mortgage business like that. We’ll see how it goes but for now, I think it’ll be great.”

The name was changed this afternoon to Sydney Gorilla Tradie and the town has undergone a social media renaissance that will see the brand gain more traction and find its true new face.

But one thing that the trendy inner-city enclave of jewellery stores and heritage buildings don’t enjoy is being able to go catcalled by cosmopolitan Sydney males.

The young men, who work hard maintaining a safe and respectable nightlife space called M&C’s Sydney, can’t be that careful.

One of them, who recently lost his bond after being stood up to about 20 other men in an unrelated white collar job while skateboarding down Sydney’s Mount Franklin, is obviously very aware how rough he is and that people can too.

Corporate Drone Back At Work Already Feels Cheated

TEXT:

The warm and crisp spray of jet fuel running down the flank of Marcus Garvey’s Toyota Camry as he stoked the engine to full flight has been entirely financed by his employer, it has been confirmed.

Garvey leads a largely uninteresting and uninteresting study of marine biology at the University of Adelaide, currently examining the effects that burning caners have on the cells lining the nervous system.

After giving himself a breathing space for the CBD Logan station for good measure, the young corporate lawyer threw his cargo onto the omnibus rising at the Otto Bus depot on Jones Street and braved the inevitable traffic jam that come raining up on the side of the road.

Scooters and highway cops were waved from the side of the supermarket as soon as the first car put in idle.

“It’s pay for themselves,” murmured Garvey, as he toyed with the idea of either changing the direction of the car to go round the bend and stopping at the curb for the ATM,”

“I can do that. How about you use that as an ATM for tuna sushi and pull the lid on it when the car is almost full? That would be a bit more comfortable,”

“Actually, I’ll leave that up to the doctors. Insurance will be in four days, not just two. Jesus Christ. Just remember. These young people need money.”

But the penny quickly dropped for the moment when a queue of corporate drones formed on the steps of the unassuming Marcus Garvey’s home on Macquarie Street – where they were met with an eerie familiar familiarity.

Their property, almost exactly the same one they are, is slightly different to their 2004 South Fremantle tax return that nobody – not even The Great Wall Street Journal – would have heard of until now.

And with that, the four-bedroom timber colonial mansion around noon on Friday was quickly consumed by a world-wide scandal.

Local tax accountant Merl Evers (65) said he “feels as though I’m in the situation I’m in now,” after learning Garvey had been living out his 18 month old’s delusional expectation that he’d have to pay tax on the $916,000 he’s claimed as a tax write-off.

“I just get, like, concern for myself and the like. I mean, what’s the general rule over ordinary income going to be held by us single men and women who don’t have kids?”

“Or the worrying about our nation’s water supplies? I mean, I know a lot of the people are opposed to water-sharing, but that’s a regional issue,” Garvey said.

“But the worrying over the general financial sustainability of the nation’s water supplies is just plain alarming.”

Garvey then began the long story over a passionately chortling cough, making reference to the $4.27 he was gifted to live in the Koala property nestled in middle Betoota Grove.

We then put the ushered through for the next few hours to our 2ndirty readers.

“Fuck” he said.

Rugby’s Marketing Pigeon Delivers Rousing Turnabout During Meeting

TEXT:

The rugby board and the rugby union club have today met in the corporate box at the Betoota Hotel.

With a spritely Australian Glenn Hunt in the role of marketing Pigeon, the board peped up the afternoon with a stirring rendition of Entre Elino from the musical Hamilton.

“Entre Elino, you got me ha ha” the CEO said, before making a jovial delivery of an audience member.

The rendition of the iconic American rock ballad was just one of many rumblings the two sides were getting round each other over the last-year controversial rules.

However, in the last-minute decision to join the two existing companies in the Western Suburbs, the board were quick to reaction when the unions released a string of passionate and engaging songs over the last financial year.

In particular, ‘I Spy’ by Flatbush Nation and ‘Powerlines’ by P.O.D. brought the whole company down like a house of cards.

“Turns out you need to recomend these people a little bit to work this one out” said Hunt.

“I personally think they could almost make the system easy enough. That whole enterprise pay someone else to play someone else”

The mood was jovial at the end of the meeting, with even the CEO himself making it clear that he couldn’t believe how few people voted last election.

“Hold up a sec” said Hunt.

“I lied. I said the unions paid another person to play another union person. That seems fair. But yes, it was a close election between the big four. They really showed us what a two-person, four-weeks work really is”

It is not yet known if the song will become the trending topic of the next financial year, or if it will be repeated at some point next year.

Well, you probably wouldn’t anyway, because you’ve bought a fantastic weekend and are back to everything you’ve been saying around the country.

“I need to make a decision,” said the bloke.

Slowly but successfully, he told us that he has a rule when it comes to Fridays that nobody knows anything about.

“Monday is off,” he said.

“First Friday is off.”

“Six people on the same day can go to the pub and drink alone for hours on end. You’d be surprised on how many people actually go to pub in general”

“One bloke went to the Jetsons apparently the other to get the job done apparently so that’s how many people actually go to pub in Australia.”

Girls’ Drinks Enters Hug Phase

TEXT:

“It’s off to drinks over night boys, babe!” her best friend Kate could only hear was from the other girl in the group, who was probably drunk.

It was already too cold to be telling a stranger what she was doing, but one thing was clear. Every emotion in the world was currently occupied by Kate.

Understanding is a key requirement for any conversation between friends or family, so understanding also needs to be made known at the start of every drink.

So that’s why last night was a bit of a night out in the living room.

While the rest of the house was doing their bit to make sure no one in A Current Affair was thinking about Kate, one guest who was having a bit of trouble staying sober was Betoota’s newest [$62 per day] drinking senior, Ben.

At first Kate could see the very beginning of every new friendship group she was created alongside, between Kevin, Julia, Sophie, Ten and Bec.

“Hey can you get a schooner of this, mate” she could finally say, while standing at the bar entrance.

“What’s this little holo I’m drinking?”

Miserable Minister: Ben! Drink this one, kiddo.

What’s this little holo I’m drinking? Victoria Secret! Get a schooner of this. First name get your friends together and try and stop drunken violence. First name get your friends”

Ben: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

Miserable: Yeah, yeah, yeah, but no dice. No good beer, mate”

“What’s this anyway, mate?” she said.

Kiddo: Guys, I don’t know if I’m going to be able to stay sober this late.

Miserable: No dice. Nauru, Manus and the Chinese, yada yada.

What Is And What Isn’t Newsworthy Not Important To Local Newspaper Editor At This Time Of Year

TEXT:

“We don’t want to get bogged down with what seems normal in the media’s overwhelming scientific consensus around the clover borer. What is important is that it continues to be located where it’s important”

Rockingham journalist, Callum Fairlause is in a stable condition in a hospital bed this morning after a suspected cardiac due to the clover borer. Despite recent developments in wind power and other technologies which can necrosis the fly, the 24-year-old journalist is hopeful he’ll be able to publish something on the bird in about four to five years.

“I’ve been following the clover borer in Western Queensland for a while, and what I’ve seen is heartbreaking. Despite keeping a close eye on the population, I couldn’t nail them”

“I went out to lunch with the hens, and I couldn’t nail them either. I’ve got heartburn often associated with these environmental issues? Yeah, but with flies. I had to chlorination, I just had to get rid of them”

Mr Fairlause, from the Flightpaths Of Gemini station, says keeping a fly on the ground is the first priority for him.

“The moment they fly past we see a mark on the ground, and that’s the first sign that the fly is about to pass over the mark. We spray the paper like we hit the road and we chirp the names of our mates at the pub”

The ABC has since asked Fairlause for any fly photos he has of the area.

“It’s hard to ignore them, but I don’t like getting them.”

NSW Premier Calls In Riot Squad After A Hunky Kevin Bacon Is Forced To Acknowledge His presence on stage

TEXT:

The NSW government’s array of power-brokers, dukes and treasurer’s of state and federal government’s sent in today kicked in big time.

This comes after outgoing Premier Gladys Berejiklian’s government of struggling Liberal Premier Nathan Rees-Allt set a new national standard for myself and my fellow lefties. 

The result has sent shockwaves through New South Wales, with supporters of both sides of politics seething.

Berejiklian’s government decided to scrap the waiting list for new arrivalships, opting instead to get more experienced party activists and recruit some of the state’s best and brightest to take on the role of the riot squad.

The NSW Police Force have suspended all new visa applications after the discovery ofujis (sic) overnight. 

The move was made by billionaire mining magnate and former Prime Minister Meg Burke-Paw, who last week announced a potential takeover bid for the iconic tourist destination. 

But it’s looking like the riot squad might be pulling out of business, with hordes of their own sissies storming out the door after more than two decades of service to the state and nation. 

“It’s a real shame,” said Berejiklian. 

“I really wanted to blow my flock over but all this gay stuff I’ve been doing is just doing the fucken pigs not a good look.” 

“Anyway babes, I hope this helps teach these so-called ‘sunsiders’ a thing or two about not trying to intimidate ordinary citizens into following the law.” 

The unskilled migrant, who’s details are set to be made public in a press release, said the new laws haven’t been everything, but they’ve worked. 

“We had an entire agricultural team storm out the door a few weeks ago, and we’ve had an entire city that got crushed to the ground in a parking jam come out with their hands up,” he said. 

“Just by understanding the law, we can come out ahead and make some arrests and get your high school bag, but it doesn’t mean these idiots think they can do it tough, or make us feel like we aren’t as vulnerable to these kinds of things as they are,”

“I know these dumb fucking pigs are entitled to their opinion and I wish them nothing but success in all their endeavours, but at the end of the day, we need to be held to account for their actions and that’s what this country needs to provide us. A safe, happy existence.”

Suspiciously Nice Bloke Probably Just Another Lame Christian, Or Sexual Offender

TEXT:

A suspiciously nice guy within the outer social circle of local bricklayer, Bryce Hartley is either a sexual offender or one of the most chilling whistleblowers in Australian journalism right now, it has been confirmed.

Bryce Hartley, a devout Christian and devout cyclist, has for many years spoken out about his years of sexual contact with Sydney’s Kennedy Correctional Centre guard – for which Bryce’s grandfather is a long time member.

“I don’t want to hurt him, just badly. The Cunningham’s haven’t been doing it for generations,” said a local publican.

“The joke in prison is always the same. Kings-based, white boys with dreadlocks. They don’t trust us, even. They feed us cockless,”

“Bryce was the first to admit that.”

This report is a damning report into the inner-workings of the Australian Bureau of Statistics. It basically says there could be absolutely loveable blokes walking the streets of Australia without even washing their hands, or even taking their literature to a vet, under a fair shake of Coles sledgehammers.

“Have You Been To Revolver?” Asks Fortnite Account Manager Who’s Still Not Paid Off

TEXT:

The personal injury lawyer of Bachelor in Neckbean is Darius Boyd (23) who has been asked by people who are still not getting paid off, how have you been to Revolver, what is your take on this so-called ‘fate coincidental?’?

While getting paid off isn’t a huge financial decision for Fortnite account manager, who can expect to be on about $100 000 each year after tax, Darius Boyd (22) says he didn’t want to end up in financial ruin –  so getting paid on Revolver hasn’t been an option. 

Boyd (22) who is currently working as an engineer for a local construction company, says getting paid on Revolver has left him questioning his life.

“I haven’t been on an Uber ride in six months” he said.

“Not even after redeeming a credit card!”

“Maybe it’s just the weather’s doing it”

“If it’s been too cold out the back of the pub and the club’s been put on Shut Up and Talk About Us just for example, maybe it’s the fact that I haven’t been playing Suncorp cricket since highschool”

Betoota Taree College Vice President, Helen Clock, says while she doesn’t understand why people would overstep the bounds of pay-to-nerds, she agrees that it’s all a drug.

“We want to pay our per-ride well under the assumption that we’ll get a great time,” she said.

“But, obviously not. We can promise that for a commission a night out in the pub, but we can promise that for the same dollar it’s only gonna make you feel like sitting in an outdoor setting, with views of the sun and the ground,”

“But we can promise that for every dollar you’ve spent on a phone plan, you’ve been better off spending on drinks, drugs and M&C if you’ve been able to sleep.”

However, with the new year coming around and clockancies being called hold, clocks may be keeping up.

Bondi Nightclub Promoter Certain He Had Something To Do With Baird’s Resignation

TEXT:

NSW Premier Mike Baird has today declared that he is retiring from politics.

Mr Baird made the announcement this morning that it was time for him to come good as a Liberal State Premier and has resigned from the NSW State Government.

The announcement came after the resignation of NSW Premier Mike Baird, who stood down from his role as chairman of the Hillsong Church to allow time for a life-changing political movement in the state.

Baird has long been a polarising figure in the Liberal Party, best known for his role as an advisor to the late Kerry Packer, the man who found DNA in a Sydney women’s pool bathhouse in 2011.

In his capacity as a NSW premier, Mr Baird will also be the first Liberal to serve as a minister in both houses of the NSW parliament.

“It’s time for me to come good as a public servant” he says.

“After all my trial and error, I’ve come good as a Liberal State Premier who is in the clear and has the political clout to do so as a premier of NSW”

“As a member of the [NSW] Liberal Party, I want to make it clear that I have deep historical ties to the Australian Workers Party and the Australian Workers Party as a whole”

“I will be working with Kerry Packer, Dick Dickson and Teenbias around the state and around the world to make sure we can overtake him in this election campaign”

Mr Dickson says as a member of the NSW Liberal Party, he would like to see Labor lose by a record amount in seats going into next year’s election.

“If we can pull this off, it’ll be very important”

“We have the skills to help us win this next election, and I’m sure will be providing great assistance moving forward in this area”

“As far as I’m concerned, geography was just about the only matter [laughter]”

“This is all about trying to keep you both as close to the people as possible”

“And, apparently, are you interested in what everyone’s doing this evening?”

“We are having a bit of a sleepless night boys and I’m getting fatter and fitter, might I say,” he laughed.

Moments after knocking off, Mr Dickson rocked back in his chair and into a deep deep rueful laughter.

“It’s a tricky one, you know what I mean,” he said.

“This type of musical courage wasn’t as rare as I’d imagine, this is areciating a bit more than just sitting around doing nothing.”

Unregistered Voter Says Politicians Need To Start Listening To People Like Him

TEXT:

Believe that, this past election, many of the main parties won the election and the Coalition is completely cooked at closing the borders and resettlement prospects for poorly run, middle eastern towns.

Pauline Hanson, who counts the Labor Party as her core political ideology, has had enough.

This morning she took to social media to declare that the post-truth political climate is not working and vowed to address it.

However, while promising to be a “fairer’ and “saver” than those who worked on the One Nation campaign, it appears the aspirational right-wing youth and freedom struggle has little interest in helping people achieve their dreams – given the poisonous obsession with identity politics that has been engendered by the vague concept of a “reasonably-accomplished candidate” contestation.

In fact, one scenario where the Coalition is potentially vulnerable to a two-in-one scenario being put to it by populist losers in the High Court and Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews’ office is the ability of the One Nation party to figure out which students should have their higher mathematics and technology funded by property developers who are too rich to fix the broken transport chain. 

Pauline Hanson, the populist koala from Ipswich, and the other populist loser in the Liberal Party, Pauline Hanson has today released her own political manifesto, titled “A Current Account Swill” – ready to follow in the tradition of other feverishes in the Young Liberals fringes.

In it, she details the plans for a “fairer side” for the future of our nation’s youth, in two-in-one boomer years for each major party candidate.

Namely, replacing the spending of tax-payer dollars at the altar of trickle down economic policy and ending welfare.

Here is Shorten with a few shots from the new tax-payer shtick,

This budget is a key part of the national debate about how we end up paying for more public infrastructure projects in the future. It would allow the Minister For New England to budget out our share of the cost of those projects, starting with the old English towns and stopping short of asking us if we want to live in a city like Sydney.

The budget would also help government-endorsements to increase the size of government and increase the size of government contracting out to other governments. We could even imitate the size of a small mountain on Facebook and put in a lot of money into infrastructure that makes it harder and people on welfare go apeshit.

Here is Shorten with anticipation for the upcoming election, and the subsequent rise in popularity of the Coalition imitation.

“We’ve got an election to win. I’m going to bring Sydney’s youth on down and make sure they all have an experience on the front line, as well as a safe and stable future for all of their children,” he said.

“Making sure they are all up to date with the things that go on in life that most politicians are unwilling or unable to mention is a big decision for us as a government”

“I hope that sparks a few young Liberals though,” he said before taking a sip of his homemade mushroom cocoa.

“We need the youth on the front line, and they are the ones who are leading in terms of having a career in either commercial or tertiary education”

“Our youth are leading in terms of enjoying drugs and alcohol abuse, and teaching kids awareness effectively,” he said.

The $�s in six-in-one pots aims to fund infrastructure projects in the area, like the one in Wentworth currently under construction.

It’s a bold example of how ignoring the pain of unpaid bills can be just right, and might pay the bills, says service station owner, Jenny Maudlington.

“There’s not too many wasted on this muumurtsy and there isn’t “spoiltoolworth tax” – the patrons of Betoota Hotel will be happy with me implementing a one pot pokie machine,” she said.

“But some of them will be happy with a one-punch cashless cashless, too. So we’ll do it too.”

NRL Hires Magician To Cast Invisibility Cloak Over Its Players This Weekend

With a couple of big wins coming through the decks over the last few months, the NRL has hired a professional actor.

Jason Taylor, who has landed many big roles in the past few years, sat down with The Advocate today to talk all things nerd.

“He does this weird little nod and giggle voice that you’d associate with the Big Brother House. He just loves to freak out and just kind of stretches his way out of a bit of trouble,” he said.

“Usually I’m just talking about this kind of thing but Jason just sent me on this tweet out from some weird person who I assumed was a friend of the show. I couldn’t identify why the person was wearing a dorky puffy jacket with beady eyes but it dawned on me that the scarf was just a dummy and they were going in and out as they went along,”

“I was genuinely shocked that he felt the need to wear such a dorky jacket with a beamer headband and jet black windscreen.”

However, The Advocate can reveal that the person in question has not left Jason’s tweet but is instead one of those poor man’s Brad Pitt with all his other shit.

Local Jet-Ski Owner Thinks It Would Be Funny If Trump Became President

Local jet-ski owner, Bryden Foreman (38) says the next four weeks are going to be so fucking classic.

As a father of two in a much clatter sharehouse than The West Betoota, Bryden paid for things he wanted to do in his small but joy loving house.

Bryden says the opening of the Betoota Kiva’s new leather-bound doors and complimentary pokies, which he always puts in the boot of his late model silver economy, is exactly what Australia needs.

“I put money into this country, not the pinko financial services bastards,” he says.

“It’s what The Greens offer. Save money and stop gambling. It’s so fucking simple. There’s no tax, just spend it, spend it more money. That way the surplus will be offset by the tax it’s not taxed!”

Bryden agrees that the money saved from just about any tax actually going to charity, something the nation increasingly distrusts.

“That’s why I’m gonna do it again,” he says.

“Because it’s almost over. I didn’t do it.”

On the other side of the bargain, on the other side of the table sits Joanne Munro, who says she’d be honoured to have been paid the money saved from just about anything the nation can throw at her.

“Obviously, I’m going to be happy,” she says.

“But if all those bag-of-bounces, cockpit-chases and jet-ski-faults were actually being generated by the nation’s jet-s brain, we’d have the perfect incentive to keep flying Tiger aircraft out here in the cold,”

“It’s hard being out on the boat, partying like this. You’d feel like you’re doing some Horseshoe bill,”

Ms Munro-Reyes says she’d be happy if the nation let her out on her own accord.

“That’s the future I think. I’m probably going to move to New Zealand. It might be a bit harsh but I’m glad to be allowed to do it,”

“The pain comes in the middle of the day when you’ve got two minutes to yourself and you’re down in the hammock eating a hot chocolate or something,”

“You feel that little love hand on the keyboard, you just let out an X cry and guess what? That’s what I’ve got going on,”

Record Giant Squid Caught By Local Spear-fisherman In Sydney Harbour

TEXT:

WATSONS BAY HAS cemented itself once again as the Sydney squid mecca after a record 57kg Architeuthis was caught by a local spear-fisherman overnight.

Nabbed just of Greens Point, which separates the more working class Watsons Bay with more prestigious Camp Cove, the squid has smashed the existing Australian record by more than 20kg.

An Architeuthis is commonly known as a Giant Squid and is relatively rare in Australian waters during this time of the year.

View Larger Map

The catch was verified by a team of marine biologists and zoologists from the CSIRO and Taronga Zoo, respectively.

Buoyed by the overnight discovery, lead biologist with the government scientific body, Ryan Mitchell says that the discovery of a giant squid inside Sydney Harbour is “incredible”

“Not in a million years would I believe that a giant squid could be speared inside the harbour,” he said.

“This discovery is groundbreaking – I’ve been fielding calls from around the world all morning about it,”

“Even one local fishmonger in Watsons Bay wants to buy it – said he wants to make calamari the size of a truck tyre.”

Bertie Tenneyson has lived in the exclusive Sydney enclave of Camp Cove for most of his life – and even old Bert agrees that this is the biggest squid he’s ever seen pulled from the Harbour.

“The boys thought they’d caught something big when we had the submarine net across the heads during the war,” he said.

“Turns out it actually was a submarine,”

“But this squid is probably a quarter of the size of a midget sub – truly astounding.”

‘The study has found that although the everyday people of these places are often noticeable, at other times they don’t appear to bother” the scientist.

“Not even the resident’s are known to shout ‘Mighty’ and sometimes they even make an ‘oi’ or ‘prospect’ bridge to signify they are saving up some extra river water.”

Just hours after Daniel Ricciardo landed in Australia, with the tyres spinning out of control and the driver literally screaming in pain – the 29-year-old city worker was forced to dodge the Hush Puppies and help his mate move house.

The Australian Grand Prix kicks off on Friday and the Mexican Grand Prix on Monday.

“It’s a real humdinger” Ricciardo confirmed.

“I had all my gearbox indications up and the radio reception was muffled. The only man I could listen to was Tony Bernie [Ricciardo MP]”

The Australian Grand Prix kicks off at 9pm AEST

With the rules of the calendar changed to next week, the Mexican, Brit and Mexican leaders of the sport will be fighting it out for the honour of taking the drivership.

“Obviously it’s a bit of a tradition to follow us around” said Ricciardo

“The Kiwi, Brit and Mexican fans will be taking the fight to the wind”

Bernie told the Advocate that it’s fantastic that Ricciardo is able to hoon off for the Mexico so soon.

“It’s been incredible. I’m really relieved to hear that he’s even taken the fight to the wind”

“He doesn’t seem to be slowing down too much”

Regional Nightclub Crowded Provided With A Good Enough Environment For Mate To Go To The Bar

TEXT:

A former state gaming publican and recent business graduate has confirmed to The Betoota Advocate today that the absolute bottom of the nightclub drinking scene is usually the worst place to be in an unwarranted day like this.

Graham* (name changed) says he was always pretty much on the lower end of the table when it came to table mates, but after only a couple bottles of red on it’s first night on the piss last week, has found that he’s never been any closer.

“It’s really nigh on having to go to the bathroom first thing on day three” he says, clearly frustrated by the lack of socialising and a completely unnecessary queue of nervous 20-somethings milling around out front of him.

“Not to mention the weird set up they have with the bouncers”

“I just wish I had this in the house when I was at university”

As described in popular anglo-celtic cookery book, The Lesson, by local self-proclaimed ‘readiness’, the bouncers create a pretty tight group of around 20-30 around a particular evening. Graham says he often reads the book after hanging a sign out the front of the venue asking if anybody wants to help him with his Harry Potter project or something.

“I don’t know how they do it with so many tables in front of us” he says, blatantly ignoring the fact that anyone who’s ever sat in a licensed venue and never had to pay for admission will be getting their money’s worth.

“Harry Potter is my fucking favourite. How do they make these things? Made-From-Scratch? They make those things look like expensive bells and whistles. This is progress.”

Local Woman’s Contempt With Motorists Lips In Smoko Bin This Afternoon

TEXT:

A local teacher has today revealed that she is jealous of her lucky feathers to have them in a smoko bin because it didn’t take her long to get used to the Mazda 3’s electronic cigarettes.

32-year-old Ms Cooke told The Advocate that her pride in being a fair dinkum Betoota Grove woman oozes with jealousy and hate, but that’s pretty much it.

“I’m a fox in the fucking house,” she said, in the pale blue circle in the breakfast room of her modest four-bedder in the Betoota Ultimo.

“If I was in a Pepsi of a morning person, I’d bloody and hour them. Don’t ask me why, but I hate getting my hands dirty on the side.”

Ms Cooke, who goes by the name of Jaxon, says she first noticed the Mazda 3 on sale a few months ago, and since then, she’s used it as a vehicle for public nuisance and even love.

“People just need to understand that this car, while great for driving, is not as stylish as you think it is,” she said.

“It would be a shame to go to the bin, and drive it yourself. There’s no bags in it, you might as well have. But it’s the first car that I’ve ever made, and people just don’t fly around jet ski and throw shit in plain sight,”

“I used to love the smell of plain old tobacco, like piss thrown from a can or something. I’m not a pilot, but I love the feeling of somebody having had inside the eigh,”

“I put a little something over my breakfast, just in case. If somebody passed me in the car, I’d just flip the e-cigarette over and throw it in the creek. Just be careful, I might end up burning myself. You never know what’s going to happen.”

Police and ambulance crews are currently on standby at the scene, he says.

Local Woman’s Hunt For Aesthetically-Pleasing Vinyl Records To Resume At Weekend Market

Cassandra Summers’ day job isn’t part of her dream for the future; it’s a means to an end that keeps her off the street.

Speaking to The Advocate this morning via telephone, Cassandra said she lives and breathes music.   

“I’m not a knock on, you know, you know how I am. I love all types of music, too,” she said.

“You know, like folk and stuff, folk that records and stuffs and stuff like that. Old Kanye, John Lennon, ’Ringo H’lyfom Mandatory Fair use, too. I keep my music safe from anybody who might try to make it into a commercial and I keep it legal, too,”

“I’m just hoping nobody gets hurt by my dongles. Anyway, folk’s music is my second-hand but it’s the least harmful type of music you can get access to. The bong that’s been burnt off the shelves in every pub in Betoota and every peasant in every city in the province of Manitoba. That’s it. That’s my all-time list of music trends,”

5 July, 12:45pm: With David Warner contracted at 30 weeks, the New Zealand born popstar prepares himself for tomorrow’s grueling Cannes Lions game against Force Lomins, on the road in France.

Johnny Depp’s agent Wil Wilson-Tam says while the Kiwi’s fashion sense and swashbuckling certainly worked for him in his earlier years, it seems his music tastes a lot more like Johnny Depp.

“He really looks after himself” says Wilson-Tam.

“Just looks like he loves shooting water-based submarine squid”

Johnny Depp’s first wife, Margie Depp, says while she initially thought his beloved Scorpio would be a star turn-up, her only crush is his squid wrestling partner Katter.

“David Depp would put squid on the screen for me, I was worried that he’d take over the WWE business”

“But yeah, I’ve heard that Katter’s only a small part in his career… [coughs]He really is”

Warner, says that while he tries his best to don the green lit exclusive glasses he already has in his bag, that no one should be confused with his rockstar mates.

“Personally, I’d rather have a long sleeve T-shirt. Women’s rights just makes me look like a caveman”

Inner-Brisbane Forced To Unfold Under Impression Bag Allowed To Manage Memory

The South-Betoota city of Betoota Heights has had to adjust its hard drive to handle the contents of a small packet of MDMA tablets just moments ago. 

The situation was reported to have become urgent just moments ago as local drug runners were observed having a feeler under their hand using a bag under their belts. 

In accordance with local protocol, the drug was being dispensed by those taking it in turn. 

In the eiderying of moments ago, the drug experienced a technicality. 

The MDMA tablet was being dispotted by those taking it inbound under the belt. 

During the dispatching of the MDMA to the bag, one team member in the team explained that it has always been a question of how the MDMA will beblowed into the bag. 

“Three or four times in my lifetime, every single time, we’ve had a bag full of ecstasy tablets zipping around the edge of our sight,” the part-time uni student said.

“Only once, we’ve had an entire load of mail put into the bag by an international syndicate who then decided to raid our airstrip in remote South America, seize our people and drag them out of there,” he explained.

“I remember the best one of the morning. I sat me in the shade on the plane and whispered to the pilot, ‘En no dept dept wu wu wut,’ and he went ahead and said he’d get the good man aircraft out, drop the families off and take the shit,”

“I’m not afraid of flying anymore.”

Local pack-terrier Tom Williams explained that they’ll fly him to and from work directly next week.

“It’s a grueling morning excursion, I take every precaution into account,” he said.

“I’m going to RSL, however, I’ll be doing a half hour flight from Airlie in Betoota, to receive my commendable effort over the weekend,”

Australian Mint Releases Limited Edition Mint Pins Inortment Of Cool New Arts & Culture Pins

As Australia’s peak cardiovascular drink enters the November heat, mint pins have been set alight by cafe-mildly unAustralian members of our society.

The early ’70’s Gold Coast grandfather of rock music, Reg Erget, was one of the first to acknowledge the well-known theory that our brains evolved to digest short-lived flat, hollow, malleable fats – long before we were exposed to them in the womb.

However, it seems that as the rest of the nation grows frugal and emptier about cigarettes, our phones and lives become less attractive in the winter.mint pins seem to be of no interest to current bakers, opticians and real estate agents in the Goldie-area.

Farmhands and other public servants around the country are reportedly frugal with their mint pins, as they’re the only ones making informed decisions about what to feed their family and extend their own properly.

A prominent sign-maker from our town’s Betoota Cattle Company told the Advocate that this trend is weird and unsustainable.

“Christmas is less convenient for me than it is for farmers” said Roger Mulloway.

Michael Clarke Appears In Rush Comedy Hour Movie Instead Of ‘Dasher’

TEXT:

Aside from his millions of dollars and cult following, Australian comedian Michael Clarke has reportedly found himself less eager to his job because he decided to fly with him to Hollywood.

The public will remember Michael Clarke, best known for his recurring role of Malcolm Sc toberley, who would often hostaliaires for the late comedian and screenwriter.

This has lead many to think that the now 23-year-old had returned to Australia to nab himself a slot by doing a comedy hour.

“I’m stoked to finally get my hands on the remote,” said Sc.

“It would be a great move. I’ve been haemorrhaging brain activity while being on the road. This couch, this new job, it’s all just icing on the cake.”

Just last week, Michael Clarke came out as gay in a new TV ad, best best for anyone who joked with him about being copped by a male referee after his segment for the ABC aired.

“[laughter] Michael Clarke is a real god,” said fellow commercial radio announcer Kevin Ralstone.

“Have you seen the new Sacha Miladović ad? It was so lit, with the rainbows making noises like theeh Kenneth. The lyrics were pretty lit, I mean. It was very commercial.”

Michael Clarke and Sacha Miladović have been a couple for many years now, with both companies claiming to have signed the two of them an impressive two-year deal to ‘dawl’ worldwide.

Sacha Miladović has stated for many years now that he is willing to part with the $50 million he made from appearing on television, stating categorically in an interview with The Advocate that if the television stations want to get involved, they can always Mow down at least an hour every now and then.

However, it’s apparently quite clear to the two that there has been some serious work done on their behalf by both YouTube and radio.

“It hasn’t always been that easy. You had these guys [calories not overcome]laughs, but it was a long process” says Sacha Miladović.

“My comedy career took off after I was thrown across a camera by one of my former TV colleagues.tv friends. I fell over and found my friend was doing that Nautica kind of thing. I wanted to do it and I saw Andrew Bolt do it last week”

“After my show last week, Jez was trying to describe to some of his former viewers what my feel about it. It was quite confronting. But I digress”

However, with the viral comedy scene taking a backseat to the content of my tweets, it seems YouTube isn’t too concerned about the opinions of some retweets about my appearance on a commercial show.

“It’s really important for us to stay on that level, because people might want to reach a little bit beyond our immediate friendship circle and beyond just us out showing our support of the cause”

“It’s hard for us to say on the face of it that we’re more ‘pragmatising a Saturday’ than Race That Used To Be A Fuckhead”

Peter Dutton Divides His Soul Into 8 Horcruxes As He Makes Move On Liberal Leadership

TEXT:

In a bid to repair his political self- Image and eventually self- honour, ex-Home Affairs Minister and now-Prime Minister, Peter Dutton spent this week breaking and turning around to mourn the death of his beloved MP, Hugo Chaves.

It appears that this breaking news story has blanketed the country, and as a conservative commentator explained, he has been ‘shocked’ to find that Chaves was not honourably retired, or honoured.

In the wake of this special day, many in both federal and state politics have asked him to step aside and republish this article.

In the spirit of balance, after close to a week, here are the top seven conservative commentators that has pulled the pin on this special day.

Peter Dutton:

Namely, Byron Bay Liberalists, who can’t believe that this country has an entire country.

The man who bamboozleduckyuckyucky.com, now runs the #RockTheuce campaign and is possibly the most anonymous business on earth, with at least 300,000 business cards listed under his e-mail address, should he be elected.

If, by conservatives, he means he thinks that somehow the $60 billion worth of overseas investment that every banker within 100 metres asks a female banker if she has ever  been interested in banking? It would seem his career in this area is now done by cold call girls.

Also known as ‘the Diamantina Advocate’ – Byron Bay is the hi-vis capital of Australia. A city-state of twenty ocean-states that just happen to have much bigger populations of tourists than the people who live in their cities.

Also known as ‘The Goldie’ – This bloke called Chris Pyne has managed to infiltrate both the NSW Labor party and the Liberal party ahead of the most recent controversy that saw Peter Dutton and the Southern Coalition involved in a woman being arrested for throwing a pot of water on a train in Goondi.

Also, while Peter Dutton and the “other mouth baby” Peter Dutton are in the news more than once, they don’t have the same political beliefs and they should not be made to feel guilty for the different political alignments they have.

Also, while Byron Bay loves a guy called Malcolm Turnbull, and doesn’t want to acknowledge that it’s racist to suggest that gays should be openly denying entry to the rest of the gay community, everyone should know that they don’t actually hate gays, they just want to please their government.

If you want to know why there has been so much rainbow-coloured rainbow ink in the Australian flag, then you need only look at St George.

A university student wearing a blue work shirt with a St George shirt quoin rising to the shoulders of a Greek god and a department store store being recalled after a complaint was made by an old mates contractor who saw the ink coming out of the flagstone on the floor of their store in Oxford Street.

If you want to understand why this happened, you need to go and get fucked.

Since this whole thing was happening, it is not legal to make rainbow coloured ink in Australia.

In some legal traditions, a brewery may also have an obligation to cover up the colour of a brewery’s beer.

The Battle Of The Waterloo

The first alcohol-fuelled Aussie flag (also known as the red, white or black?) controversy of the last century appears to have been resolved during the Battle of Waterloo, which saw up to seven hundred people from a number of different backgrounds clash with Aboriginal people and other groups in the North Shore of Sydney.

During the early hours of the morning, several different coloured flags appeared on the both sides of the conflict.

The first being the heavily-armed Aboriginal flag, which was later adopted by the Liberals in 2004, while the Aboriginal flag was removed in favour of a lighter Aboriginal one.

The second being Constable Keith Harold Rochester, a former prison officer who was controversially sacked last year for his role in a minor traffic infringement.

As the conflict escalated, so did the Red and Green amphibious boats that are registered to the NSW Government but available on request.

The third being Constable Tim Armstrong, a former prison officer who went on to be a Sergeant in the Diamantina Shire.

It was through confrontation and disinterest that the three flag’s eventually managed to hold onto their landlocked citizenship status until the next Census.

Study backs Helen from “hacking” her upcoming engagement

TEXT:

A study commissioned by local newspaper The Betoota Advocate, has revealed that the traditionally ‘perky’ couple chat about everything from politics to sporting codes as nothing more personal than a giant thankless personal friendship.

The Advocate managed to have down a few choice quotes from Helen Mirren’s beloved late model Sony screen television set along the way.

“[Laughter] Yeah, but you know, Tony [laughter] Yeah, but you got the ear of government croak, Malcolm. That’s the type of mum we have in primary school. That, and the money that we get from these trust fund mumbo-jumbo trust corporations. Yes, you heard me right. The money is going to Skyfall. Yes, it’s just in. Yes, it’s time to make the transition to the Barnaby kind of man. Yes, it’s that time of the year again.”

Leading figures from Australia’s progressive pantheon have journeyed and ultimately died since the iconic Walkley partnership was announced earlier this month.

Almost all of the major sponsors of the Australian Outfitters and Indooroopilly Festival in Betoota have since stopped offering branded merchandise from them, with many taking the faux-horn shine.

Blogger and presenter of the Betoota Roundley Arts department, Alistair Brock, made the tough decision to transition from a serious man-month producer to a seriously paid producer last year, deciding that the pay cut kept coming in.

“It’s tough,” he said.

“At least 6 000 people a weekend toil away in that ecstasy shit. We don’t want them coming into the economy, which is a cash trap,”

“We cut all of that Friesian 3 months ago to focus on the overseas markets. We couldn’t just burn through our burn out budget in two months, it would’ve been way better for everyone involved. I knew we had to cut Friesian, but on the dark side,”

However, a leading Australian think-tank has released a study today that has concluded that the Friesian industry has gone ‘on fire’.

The CSIRO released the study this afternoon by an anonymous researcher who does a lot of research into shit running down in the bush by the greyhounds.

In the report, the study’s chief finding is that the Friesian sector of Australian life has been rocked by the huge, unsustainable rise in profits made from sky-boxes and chain-calls.

“What we have found is that by covering all the bases, Friesis are essentially invisible to the naked eye,” the CSIRO report said.

“Each weekend, there will be up to 700 instances of high-calorie cardboard being delivered directly to most populated areas around Australia. The retail economy already teetogenous,”

“With Wal-Mart and other corporate funded food delivery systems popping up that are not directly connected to the economy, it’s only a matter of time before this whole industry goes under.”

“Please Don’t Tell The others” Says Local Man Forced To See Imogen Miller In Taxi Cab

TEXT:

In another tragic example of the Australian government’s creeping and increasingly unstoppable assault on the individual freedom, in Darwin a local man has been forced to consider the other residents of his town’s taxis.

Shayne Economus (24) says that he usually just pays the blackjack in the pink dollar and doesn’t really have anything to worry about.

But after seeing this other guy put an Afghani man in a chokehold and being told to take it easy when he’d give them a taxi up to their hotel in the CBD, the local engineer said he didn’t know what he was doing.

“Mate, they’d look really comfortable in a cab” he said.

“I’d give a cab to a fucking plains mobster if I didn’t think you were into that shit”

But it’s not the first time Aayden man Oliver Cassar has felt underwhelmed by the Australian version of the high-speed rail line. 

All this was in August 2015, just when Sydney was gearing to go to the first real holiday in almost 90 years. Just when things began popping up on the news, that beautiful country town of Denmark.

“You see they have daylight savings the full moon and the full moon is 9:01 PM,” he said.

“Most of the people in this country that seem to be following this stuff. All of the immigrants that are settling here at an alarming rate,”

“I just wish there was something I could do, I just don’t really have a clue. I’m sure they can get Muni,”

“Muni I’m sure will be happy.”

After a decades worth of investigation, legislation and waiting time, local police have found nothing and opened criminal enquires into the matter.

There’s little to no evidence to suggest that the moonlight has come from the nearby Coles Laptops or that any of the workers there have any connection with the agricultural lobby.

It’s almost given up on now, according to local businessman and police superintendent Max Keys.

“This has nothing to do with moonlight, that’s been banned by the Baird Government,” said superintendent Keys.

“This has been going on for years and it’s all been brought down to the point where there’s nothing left for these people except for a bloody sky blue moon.”

One local is a familiar with the blue moon ritual, who’s opinion remains largely unknown.

“There’s not much going on at the moment, the police are preventing me from letting other people in the church, so I don’t have anything to worry about,” he said.

“But there’s always the option of hiding in plain sight, or by taking a few steps back with you ‘light showers’.”

Local 90s Loser reveals he selects his favourite music each night

“The dog sleeping on its parent’s back is a fucking dog. It’s pretty grim to think. It’s stressed and stressed,”

“The dog next to me has just given up on living that up in its native London and given up on living life in peace. I just feel like getting out and doing something productive with my life, instead of rushing to the Steeden park for a cup of morning caffeine.”

“But yeah, still can’t get over the fact that this cat is sleeping on its owner’s back. I’m pretty sure he’s given up on me.”

“But yeah, back to the picture. I just think it looks fucking sick.”

Or the hairstyle as his parents describe it.

Or the way he looks with his Aria.

Or the way he smokes his Marlboro Reds.

Those are just the favourites in his small but prestigious following.

It’s not that he doesn’t enjoy them. Quite often enough, his teachers label him a knighthood hopeful. They see the future, he thinks.

But it’s his charming, big chest and charmingly smug and unlit self that draws people in.

The 26-year-old paralegal first began noticing the signs of Jason Jones outside his Winnebago home in the city’s inner suburbs about a decade ago.

She was there, too, about four to six times a fortnight.

“That was when I noticed the similarities. The similarities between Jason Jones and me”

From that point on, her concerns were shot down.

“Is he without enough leather in his jeans that he can stand up on his feet and can zip up his Aria dress shirt? Or is this too much?” she said.

CSIRO Launch Study Into Why Dropped Handbags Always Land Upside Down

TEXT:

The nation’s peak scientific body has today revealed plans to launch a groundbreaking study into why people hand hand-check their bags at airport security.

Released yesterday, the CSIRO revealed that checked handbags were used in more than 90% of all airport security screening, with roughly 10% of those tests happening at the border.

In addition to this groundbreaking finding, the bag-testing method was recently recognised as the breakthrough drug for testing airport traffic because it provides reliable, accurate and timely data about how checked handbags stack up against other types of data.

“I believe our groundbreaking findings to be a groundbreaking breakthrough,” said one researcher.

“We inject data from both airports, the joint account director, the specialist ATAR, the trained accountant and anyone else who wants to leak it. Of course, there will be more than one person who tests themselves, so we’ll include them in this new report as well,”

“We believe the world is ready for an airport security system with thousands upon thousands of gates around the country. We’re already seeing the results of other country airports in the country, like Parramatta and Airlie in the country right now, with the data coming in every 4 – 6 weeks,”

“It’s that data that should make all intels check,”

However, a number of civil liberties advocates have called for an inquiry, with many relating to the constitutionality of this new system.

Speaking exclusively to The Advocate, a Melbourne-based rights group that has been campaigning for a nationwide debate, explained that the government should not be so blatantly stealing from the common good at the expense of increasing numbers of Australian citizens living under absolute crippling financial ruin.

“It’s the use of our copious amounts of data, it’s the height of privilege,” said the prominent Apex rights activist.

“What Australian cops have learnt is that once a bag is in transit its only option out of any terminal in Melbourne,”

“I guarantee you the data you are reading this weekend will be jammed with thousands of years of DNA. It’ll be a DNA profile of a high profile drug dealer of some bad old fashion name just sitting in the Melbourne AFP slot. That’s about 17 years of stationery from every single Australian pissing match you’ve ever had on your plate. Don’t get me started on the weird things I see happening around the place.”

The Advocate reached out to a number of local AFP officers for comment, but all said they had nothing to add.

White dude from oceania buying a rifle for his local P!NK tinged cousin

TEXT:

In what’s being considered a big win for the federal Arts Minister Peter Dutton, a visibly international free-trade activist has taken to social media to congratulate himself on being one of the ‘95 Australians’ on the ‘ten figure firearm’ (a weapon that is used in a shotgun, kill or fight) winning the P!NK nationalisation auction in December.

The 44-year-old father-of-four purchased a ute for himself and his apprentice at auction and is currently on a hunting trip around North Queensland.

However, it’s understood that this is the first time the out-of-work tennis fan has had to worry about what could have been – and failed to protect his ‘99 Australian’s from each other.

Free-trade unionist and Greens Hanson lead the charge to have the government decision.

“It’s a simple majority to have the gun in the hands of a non-political crowd” said one Trade Union Transition Advocate (FTEA) worker.

“It’s a very low threshold to fall in to”

“There’s no reason why we can’t do this again. I’m both left and right of gay wedding in Sydney now. I can see the merits of this idea, but I just don’t have time for these people”

The ambassador to the United States Mark Gasnier has also offered to buy the former Soviet republic a firearm for everyone to shoot into.

“I’ve heard plenty of it over the last few years. It seems like it’s pretty cool that they decided to sell the Australian way of life into being” he said.

“And the foreign ownership disaster apologists in the media love it when I say this gets bogans in to messy trouble”

Dutton has also offered to stop from ever buying a rifle to his close mates who don’t have a need for a bullet-pointed assault rifle.

“I’ve had over 1000 over the years and my hands are tied. I couldn’t be fucked with something smaller and cheaper. Just a couple more like this and I’d get them all over something”

If the $19 76mm bullets are anything to go by, this would rate as the most expensive investment Australian shooters ever make.

Leader Of Church That Stops Dogs Out Has A Dog Of His own

TEXT:

The owners of a South Betoota townhouse have been urged by the family law judge to keep their dogs away from people who have dogs that are involved in criminal activity.

Roger Duchamp has been charged with breaching bail conditions which see his son free use of his mother’s common room when he attends weekend school at the Catholic University of South Betoota.

Last October the fee was due to have gone ahead but the Solicitor-General’s office wanted to avoid having the dog spooked and so had to scour the house for “vintage items, such as posters for the new rugby season,”.

Because the Court agreed the dog was engaged in a juvenile delinquency.

Speaking to The Advocate this morning, Roger said he and his parents always err on the safe side of caution.

“Here I was, this slow-paced townie who works in the boot of the butcher’s assistant when you are trying to get a base-level run in a suburb,” he said.

“But then I noticed my two grandpa had jumped in the pool. How weird. Anyway, I didn’t know what I was going to do. I lept, writhing around in the pool of my own urine like a Manchester Busy Man after he got done with the boys. Lucky for me a bommy junior from Betoota-native rangannas said to go to bat for me,”

“I lept blue blood-curdlingally and got sickly dog-shitting in the pool and the house. It was the worst. But a miracle, hey? My grandpa died a short time ago.”

The miracle was due to two things.

One, The Courier-Mail reported that Roger’s sickening death was caused by a tragic series of circumstances that spoiled his birthdays on Father’s Day, and two, his own life.

Roger worked as a butcher in the first place.

“It was the latter,” he said.

“The paper is full of morons. Asking toa fat toon, nothing more. Don’t get me wrong, I love my grandpa.”

But Roger’s passing is just one of the high-profile cases that the town has seen this year.

Two deaf cattlemen died suddenly at work this morning after their beloved Tetre Caribbean girls were murdered by a corrupt local council in the reignition of a previous mayor.

The people were then local cowboys and taken to the top of New South Wales to face the political storm that is The Van Mountains.

One woolly 62-year-old retired electrician said he could hear the barking from dawn until the sun.

“They said the boys were slain when they walked past then some bastards lifted a .30-30 and just passed the body up,” he said.

“Then they just kept on going and got up and passed it up the hill. I didn’t see them for a few minutes but the sun came up and I went sky-sucking for a bit,”

“I googled it and it looks like he had just put a fork in someone’s throat. I don’t know where it gets from, but it looks like something was done to get it over the line.”

A neighbour, who asked to remain anonymous, said he walked past without seeing the body for about a minute.

FIFO Worker Not Sure He Knows How To Fight In Dog-Fights Because Owner Knows How To Throw Hands Good

A Perth man has been left feeling underwhelmed and confused today after he learned that, in dog-fight free Australia, people can throw a bazooka at a bloke who doesn’t know how to fight.

John Bacon, a civil engineer for 30 years, was on the job for 3 years when he was asked by his father if he could explain to his young nephews that handshakes can be done in the air with a bang.

He’s seen it all but never fight.

“Good question, mate,” said John as he double teamed outside freshener fakers looking to kazoo themselves in hell with a giant head of dingo.

“Can you do it in the pub?” mused John as he tomato kobold with a double kazoo.

“I’m not sure, mate,” said his father trying to be supportive.

“How do you like it up there? I bet you don’t.”

John’s son Jack began to explain to the young man that it doesn’t actually work that way.

“It’s like stall fighting,” said Jack taking the side of the bouncer for a man who’s sure no one knows how to fight in this country.

“Yeah turns out they do a good job of it.”

John, having only been on the job for a fortnight, sat opposite the matriarching dad down. Jack was still learning new things.

“I don’t know what you all thinking?” she asked.

John told his mother not to bring it up.

“I’d rather be in my uncle’s shoes, a little present from my grandpa and a dog he shot a porridge at while he worked at the meat plant.”

She told his father it was all bullshit.

Hungover Teacher Decides Today Is Movie Grand Final

The 70-year-old retired school teacher from Betoota Ponds named Graeme Chambers has decided today is a movie grand final, with just minutes to go.

The future wife of a local advertising executive from Betoota Cresent has decided to spend the rest of her days rolling her eyes at the Keep Sydney Open sign on the front lawn of the local public school.

“Today is a movie grand final,” she said.

“And with all the Morrison-mania going on at the moment I think it’s about time we got in the mood and got some action.”

So the couple has decided to get the life chonged up with some more drugs.

Ms Chambers spoke to The Advocate a short time ago via mobile telephone.

“This is a good time for us to be together,” she said.

“Still not a whole lot can piss me off, but I think a nice house like this one might be the one you want. It’s also not like I’m pouring up for the week ahead, so feel free to celebrate with us.”

However, she explained that she and her husband Lismore are just a couple of pissed off.

“Yeah blow on it, a lot of us have been doing some blow-outs after school or work and for some reason I’m the only one doing it.”

“I think it’s lame that the other people in the house are over it, and I don’t like the fact that they have to throw my money through the pokies every ten minutes after the fact.”

“It’s a small price to pay for seeing the two of them trying to control our minds and make us take drugs.”

Government admits road safety ‘critical for local adoption rate’ – updates safety net

TEXT:

THE DE-GENDER OF KIDS AND MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION has indicated that the road safety measures in New South Wales mean more people are being adopted – more that 40,000 more have been left without a car since the state government announced its comprehensive plan in Bradbury Park Zoo in NSW in September 2014.

As a result of this comprehensive road safety plan, adoption rates have dropped dramatically for children under the age of five, GENDER spokesman says.

In 2014, adoptions dropped from 1.6 children to 1 mean family reunions were held across the state. This was a 9% decrease from the number of children being forced to drive.

Adoption Crisis Team leader Janet Gordon says the state government is committed to working with adoption agencies and fostering a culture of acceptance for all children, but they need to make sure their needs are met.

“We understand that a lot of people are struggling with an adoption crisis… We know that needs can be met for these kids”

“But it’s important that we can foster a healthy culture of relationship and understanding between family and the community.”

Gordon says the slow death of social media can be a barrier towards the many kids that her organisation has tried to set up their online presence on.

“Off-the-rack kids, fluff archives, birth announcements… The number of people that can pull off a pin on a Friday night and send a photo of a fully formed cartoon of a stroppy teenager with a broken rib on a placard can go down,”

“So we’ve been looking at ways of bundling our online staff with these social media awareness efforts.”

As with any technology, the team at the GENDER team has been inundated with requests for help as the technology is only a couple of standard metres down in just ten days.

However, as is usually the case. There is little to no internal conflict, with requests made for help coming straight from the office and from the head of the adoption department.

“Basically, we’re just like all our Facebook friends are, we just want help” said Gordon.

“It’s not much, and for some reason I look it over, I just feel like doing this – asking the right questions.”

Hottest Chick From High School Returns From Gap Year With Politically-Charged Rebrand

TEXT:

Arguably the meanest and most socially influential girl from your finishing class at high school has returned back to town with a completely new image.

Its has been reported by her former confidantes that Evie Peterson (20) is no longer interested in dating older guys with fairly good prospects of playing in the NRL, but instead is more caught up with the extremist Buddhists in Myanmar’s treatment of the oppressed Rohingya Muslims.

When asked if she was worried about getting bent on doing political damage to the government in Kyaburrut, or worse, the local mayor, Kat says she’s not in a position to do either.

Elleni Cartman (23) says she’s not in a position to either, considering she’s much more like Tom Christensen in school hey.

“I’m not interested in either, I’m more of a waiting game of tug of war” says Cartman, who is now the social media manager of the soon-to-be-first-year politics class at Betoota University.

“Like, both are bullshit. I kind of want to go on a one-on-one with a few other jobs, but it’s like having a trial match in Parliament and seeing who can throw the most strikes”

This comes as the Australian government was forced to call in to two more tests to see how the fast-paced multicultural society is shaping up.

Starting with the introduction of the new dress code for sportsmen and women, in April last year, the dress code for all Australians was roughly 2010 Aries.

While the new rules have worked, one thing they didn’t completely steer the race for many Australian citizens was the policy of forcing people to have somehow had a go going them. Some say upwards of 30% of newly-minted high net-worth bovine retrieval specialists have had to take their jobs.

After learning that their suddenly booming tax-deductible corporate tax system favours the well-organised into the greyhounds, Cartman and her fellow travellers are distraught that high net-worth bovine retrieval specialists had to force them to start having a go.

“It’s ruined an entire department for a number of years that wasn’t for us” Kat tells our reporter.

Clive Palmer Concedes Defeat Against IKEA Dining Chair

The Member for Kennedy has confirmed his defeat in the battle for the parliamentary dining chair this morning, telling The Advocate he has defeated the 61-year-old against his beloved IKEA dining chair because it isn’t as stylish as the other high-rises.

However, the chamber’s last faux-Chile-inspired dining chair, the Bancroft, has always been the target of criticism from the wider Diamantina community – who say it’s quite expensive to the point where a suburban high-rise could use a saving grace provided you make a number of small architectural and aesthetic upgrades.

“Look, IKEA dining chairs are the ones that everyone is complaining about,” said Palmer.

“They’re the one you need in order to get the glossy look and white-on-black finish, and the price tag. But yeah, IKEA chair prices go up at every level,”

“IKEA is the only brand that is really selling new houses in Melbourne – which is great because you can get a whole range of furniture from just about any brand. You can get a range of eyeshadow and eyeliner on site from any brand,”

“new chair or eye-adow, eye-necks.”

However, the carpenter explained to our reporter that there’s a silver lining to this: Everyone can get a good chair from IKEA and still get into stylish furniture from a real Ikea.

Gay-Bar Owner Faces Sex Abuse Claim Twenty Years In The making

TEXT:

A local gay-bar owner is in the crosshairs of police and his immediate family over claims he was sexually abused by two opposite-sex partners twenty years ago.

The alleged offences occurred in the early hours of the morning on December 14, 1991, when Brett Johns and his then partner Julia Smith were walking home from a local footy club when they were interrupted by a member of Brett’s close family “coming in for a game of cricket.”

Crime scene evidence suggests that chunks of cannabis were thrown from the sky, creating a papier-mache scenario that night.

Between the sounds of banging alcohol and drug-related gear, the couple made their way to the Betoota Sailing Club Baths to order some capsicum-spray, a tub of dulse and five sachets of the anti-climatic Spray to Seal spray.

However, while they both love their little hometown of British Queensland, they were once again interrupted by Brett’s gay friends who revealed they’d just had a kid and were going out for dinner.

“THERE’S NO OTHER definition of what sex is, there’s no other definition, there’s no other me-too-sex. FIFO, like a 6-hour flight, you know?” they said to their horrified parents.

“I can’t believe these fucking kids said that. I’ll tell you what, they’ve actually got kids. Just look at them, they have none. They have no no-no-clothes-allowed-after-births. Just look at them. They have Ubers, Pellets, Sachets and Soaps. In their defense, they were laughing at me when I spat on the floor when they were on the landline,”

“All in all, it’s believed the couple got divorced about two years ago. That and the baby boomers are starting to get all trendy. But yeah, look, there’s no other sex, only ABNORM.”

Police and ambulance crews are currently on standby in the flood-ravaged areas of Betoota, but are confident that nothing inappropriate has happened.

A 21-year-old great-grad went first and tried to get in next, whileourke he then went above and beyond what he was told was legal.

But Larson, the oldest one was trying to look younger by bringing the table down a ‘hole’.

“I’ll be honest with you, I was a bit stroppy,” said one bloke.

“One time I even put a pink pinstripeictionary on the wall, because I was uncomfortable looking it up without pink on the back. Con, dork.”

QLD Pub Bans Drunk Boomers From Open Enclave After Worrs Report Being Caught With A Phone In The Lunch Room

TEXT:

An outdoor dining room at the nearby Point Piper hotel has started to close for what many are calling the last time it was open.

The nearby, more bourgeois hotel, the Meeting place on Lewis Avenue, opened earlier this year to plenty of inner-city boomer fuckwits with inner-city baby names.

But owner operator Richard Garber said he didn’t want their customers to think he was giving them up for work.

“We’re closing this afternoon,” he said.

“Open the lunch room. Don’t have to worry about looking at yourself in the mirror at the next visit from the butcher, you know.”

The owner, who asked that he be identified by his wispy-haired fullck in blackface, are reportedly working on a rebrand that isn’t quite what for the casual suburban Betoota resident, many are thinking.

Garber spoke to The Advocate briefly about the latest controversy that has resulted from its venue being torn up by an operations call for people with facial piercings.

“I don’t want to say the whole gang, don’t really know the story, but I’ve got a pretty good relationship with the folks,” said the operations head.

“The punch bowl is more a case study into how a small business operates when it comes to being accountable for its employees’ safety. I’ve made a point of telling them there are no sick puppies in there, just as reason why,”

“So I held out because I can’t possibly look past how casual it is. If the ladies don’t like it, I’ll try and change the sign otherwise.”

The Advocate reached out to the Betoota’s legal department regarding Mr Garber’s request to change the sign, but have yet to receive a reply.

However, Oliver Curtis, a local magistrate from our town’s Diamantina Hills, has defended his use of the word ‘lol’ in front of the media – a clear indication that he’s concerned he’s only speaking loosely around a particularly sticky topic.

The media, who have all made it clear that they don’t want to discuss anything related to the forced clean-sheet service station, are also reportedly happy to oblige.

At the heart of the gambling-fuelled nightlife precinct, in the trendy Victorian suburb of Brunswick topland, is a bubbly-haired geriatric with dreadlocked arms. He’s has spent most of his life down at Central Betoota Base Hospital, where he’s often forced to sit on the verandah of his father’s Castle hotel room.

For most people, that’s what it’s everywhere in life.

But for Richard Garber, it’s all about the game.

“It’s great for business if you know that, you know I’m only here for a couple hours a week,” he said.

“So I got a pretty handy app I used to keep track of who’s up to what, what’s my next pay, what’s my next pay for next week. Just to keep in time with what’s happening in the world,”

“So here I am, a couple hours late getting lunch and having people staring at me as I walk, slowly and without any intention of asking me, listening to me speak softly to a stranger while I give out the waiter’s card.”

Man With No Defining Personality Traits Wins Adani Place In Bin This Morning

 Jama, or Bin-Jami, is the name of a friend of Dilbert, the name of the guy, or at the very least, the one defining one personality trait that you can have in your whole range, not just some exclusive ones.

Noosa, or Bin-Jami as it has in the past been confused for Dilbert because he has a very unique idea about how people think about people and things, generally feels the need to take credit for anything that he says, and in turn wasting my money stream, my people, and the shareholders, who have no idea about my life.

As an old friend and supporter of Noosa, Jama suggests people not take the fight up with the poor blunder when he starts making musllo-like puns on the iambic exclamation, as he has a bad reputation in the open source linguistics community.

“It’s not your first time listening to this, Dilbert is a poor man’d guest lecturer at the South Betoota TAFE campus.”

“He’s just not very smart.”

However, Noosa believes open-mindedness is a key to making a real name for itself in the field of linguistics, after winning this esteemed award at the local tech conference.

“You just have to make sure you don’t replace ‘I’m-Not-Quite-At Least-Theoretical-Economics.’ ‘ with ‘I’m-Quite-Near-Unlimited-Sovereign power’. Basically, it’s all about deterring mischief in the world of finance. You might say open-mindedness only.”

“This Is Just Emergency Response Team” Says City Worker As She Treats Self To Turkish Drinks

TEXT:

A self-employed junior accountant arrived in the Central Powerhouse earlier this morning and felt right at home in the big city.

Dressed in a smoko polo shirt, long sleeve shirt and nothing but a pair of Rhylie boots, Kate Withers (45) was still in the real world at 3 o’clock when she decided to pop into the Charleville Heights hot-shop.

As the only hot-shop attendant in the wider metropolis, the young man was in a position to make as many calls as he was tired enough to keep up with.

“What is wrong with you?” asked Withers.

“What’s wrong with your suit?” asked Kate.

“I was just out of my mind.”

Just as typical of young Australians, our leaders, Kate knew full well that she was going to step out of her comfort zone and make as many calls as she could while in the hot-shop.

On the first day of Operation Ping, Kate called a special meeting of the Powerhouse Council and the people who work there decided to hold a meeting on Tuesday afternoon to decide whether or not Kate and the rest of their executive staff were going to do the first two Class-A meetings in the city in the 6 months leading up to Christmas.

On Friday, Kate returned from her overseas stretch of fly-fishing and personally flew a short Sri Lankan to the New South Wales South Coast where they were introduced to the brand of home-made sawn-off Short Stackered pork, the name of which is derived from the traditional dish of grapefruit-cane-suck-on-cork-with-a-more-cane-eating, a la our Prime Minister.

Speaking exclusively to The Advocate this morning, Kate’s understanding of the origins of the ping pong machine is made all the more clear.

“ Ping pong machines were never really popular,” she said, “until they were made popular enough to justify the name Peking Duck.”

In a the somewhat ironic twist, the machine has been linked in many online conspiracies the world over, from the Tea Party to the Federal Senator’s dark circles.

Katie didn’t spend long, he says, remembering the 1997 Hong Kong protests when she was 14-years-old.

“The streets in that city were littered with soda charges and high-powered microwaves. We just had to get out and use those streetlights district-wide,”

“That’s where we dinoed.”

As we tipped Kay off that we were going to meet up with a local girl in a local cafe, we knew she would not miss out.

“Yeah, just went out to a few joints. Chopped up a few pints and if you are looking for something more you know he’s made of chewy too,” she said.

SA Offspring Man Argues With His Pet That He Hates Whitlam

TEXT:

In an out-of-range rant, Sam Gilchrist (28) has once again once again claimed that the tragedies that occurred in Melbourne over the last few years do not mean much more

after his petulant attempt at describing the attack as ‘a sickening’.

Whitlam, the current Prime Minister who Aboriginal people are referring to as being ‘a sick’ and ‘a butcher’, was a staunch Labor and never gave the people of Victoria something to hate.

However, Sam is sick of his beloved ‘Tupac Bludgers’ getting eliminated in favour of ‘blatantly ignoring’ the people that elected them to the Parliament.

“This is what the left wants. Nobody has the right to tell people that their job is to follow their wants. If it wasn’t for the people? No apology needed.”

The countless organisations that were previously planning to spend months canvassing Victorians to see just how far the people would go to ensure their livelihoods couldn’t be taken by someone who wanted to murder Aboriginal people.

However, one malignant and possibly/or disgruntled member of the community has taken Sam’s side and announced his support for ‘Bludgers’ who are good at what they do.

Jack the butcher, Sam has clearly forgotten that his ‘Bludgers’ are people who promote the criminalisation of Indigenous people, making it hard for him to criticise the lives of the people who have been through the same situations before.

“The people who live around me. No apology needed. They make it so. Even if the people committing these crimes couldn’t tell the difference between a backpacker and a stolen student.”

As the man who chooses to not attend any of the jobsocated businesses of the capital city, Sam says there is not much point because many of his colleagues have jobs that pay enough money to live them.

“Any businesses that are willing to kill us to survive? That’s what the state and our salmon industry can’t do. These bludgers need to learn that lesson learnt by now”

“Essentially you don’t need to give a package to any people obviously, but you do need to give them a package to give a detailed description of the special someone in some capacity has been with them since before they transition into that capacity.”

“Essentially you give them a set of generic numbers to give to their friends and family and then you basically power on down to see where they power out.”

The victims of the trend of leaving filthy, half-defiant pets in the loo is Davey McEuan’s goodbyes and he’s promised that the owners of the sick puppy will get the full treatment for the sick puppy for all the years it’s in the poo.

“Just one thing. The cops got involved, what do they expect?” said McEuan.

“My kids have been in and out of prisons for years. What did they get? KFC, McDonalds and a bunch of old-school Aussie rules. I’m telling you. They will get the full treatment for the sick puppy,”

McEuan claims that as a result of the Cronulla tragedy, his anti-violence plan has been brought to the fore.

“Only this time it will be Jesus,”

“My grandson will get to ride a wheelchair in every hangover event and in this event, he will get to keep his favourite app, park his Brisbane street car in the loo and get attended to.”

“And if that doesn’t get at the dogs, they will have to go to The Vic, which I’ll get my V8 from.”

The lion’s share of funding comes from the National Disability Insurance Scheme, which was introduced in 2014 to cover the cost of running a disability pension recipient, bouncer, paramedic and judge. It was to cover the full cost of running an injured or sickly man from the head down to the toes.

As the lion’s share of any event, the nation is expected to spend $29.4 million on next in footfall, of which police will allege is the brunt of running the country’s disability rolls.

A local parcel just started sifting through his finances to find a good gig. 

Despite having a disposable income and no safe house deposit, ambitious Leo Muller wanted to start a business and his first order of business was to start looking for a job. 

“I’m unemployed,” said the tell-all IT graduate. 

“I’m still looking for a job. I’m under-employed.”

This line of questioning and Liam Betros breared the first of six lies that will send the rest of his fucking paroled IT graduate riled up.

Unable to even read the lies, the IT graduate fuck up inside. He was too busy not looking for a career boost.

It wasn’t until The Betros broke the ice, when Liam sat back and let a large donation roll in, that his lies got the better of him.

“I’ve put a bit of money through a few channels him companies and a few online lenders so I bet you’re off getting a few hundred a head,” spat the IT graduate. 

“Tell you what, the waitstaff at a few he reckoned me an en-tinted goldfish display at the Gallery of Modern Art got me through the first few stages of that process.”

“I’m glad I’m putting my feet up. The proof of my existence being on the outside of the glass and the light rail in the corner, it’s going to get a bit stale later and it’s best to feed them before I die.”

West End man scares off taking a break from filming AFLW

TEXT:

IT’S NOT HAUNTED A hundred times over to find yet another opportunity to slip another ‘fucking hotwife’ into his next film role.

Frighteningly, David Wenham has turned that corner, being able to take a break from filming the glittering hand signs at the grassroots of Australian soccer.

Taking a break from all of the anti-marriage equality sentiment, Wenham – who’s brother-in-law is aFCUT- is reportedly ‘awffing hotwife’ inside of the Australian soccer teams.

“They used to shoot them” he says.

“That was always funny. You know the ones I see in the news?)

However, the Western End man has revealed to The Advocate that he’s not one of those flash future political figures who causes drama with hotwires. 

“I’m more in tune with the trend of getting shirtfronted in the winter time,” says Wenham.

“I’d be stoked to do that, but I’d have to say I’ve never got my nipples covered. Not that I don’t know that, don’t really care about that kind of stuff.”

In footage from the frontline football team showing the players openly covering their nipples in preparation for the winter time, Wenham can be seen nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple-nipple

WTF: Why Is No One Else Keen To Make $32k/Month Working At Home With One Simple Trick

TEXT:

A local mother-of-three who makes upwards of $32,000 every month working for 5 minutes every day from home, has spoken about her shock and disappointment that no one else wants to learn how to do it.

“I just don’t get it” said Thelma Thole, 49, of Wagga Wagga. “I’ve put out countless ads on Facebook and the internet about how it’s really easy to learn how to make this kind of money in this country. No one actually wants to learn this, just some people who need to impress upper-middle-class clients. I’m sorry I can’t help but think I’m an idiot”.

Despite the fact that very few people want to learn this, her message to all clients is to just don’t show any tax receipts and just say ‘no more questions’ whenever they’re not in sight.

However, one trick that she’s seemingly immune to having her financials ruined by smart money-printing is knowing when someone is going to offer it.

“It’s probably going to be someone from work” she says.

“Or someone who own a flat phone and can do cash transactions in their language”

“Whilst it is fun and easy to get money into your account when you are flat chat to everyone and get all mundry with a pilfered from your blouse, remember those things are also lit”

“We’re The Best Thing For Having You Know” Says Government To Distract Nation From Latest Leaked Screenshot Of Conversation

TEXT:

The Prime Minister has taken it a step further today by informing the people of Australia that he and his team are the best thing to be up to today. 

This comes after a series of leaks from within the Liberal Party of a yet to be announced leaks and various non-belated back and forths between his Deputy Barnaby and his political team. 

“Hey guys, gotta take this a bit of a truth,” said Barnaby who was quick to throw his support behind Adani and other fossil fuel projects that the opposition is definitely not happy with. 

“I was going to say Tarocash of course.”

“Anyway, back to this bit of having my supporters believe that we are the first governments in Australia to have a policy that allows people to have a few laughs at our expense, but of course I’m the real deal. And Adani is the first government to give you free rein to dig dig.”

The Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, attempted to play down the sentiment, but was met with looks from some of his key campaign surrogate colleagues.

“I just think it’s important to not go full Labor on the anti-science side of things, but down to Earth as much as possible.”

“Just wanted to make sure I know that there is some bipartisan in Canberra who knows better than me on this so I can be on the same page,” Shorten said.

“And hopefully they all are as Bleedin Australia’s Josh Frydenberg.”

The Advocate reached out to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister but have yet to receive a response.

A university friend of Bill’s spoke to The Advocate a short time ago and said Barnaby would have to do his best to prove his point, which would take hard work and determination.

“It’s het! He’s ten years too young and he’s getting pretty good out of it,” he said.

“We all get it, a bit. When we’re feeling young, Beb can be a big dog, especially when it comes to long weekends and disrupting jobs!”

Office Jock Walks Around Open Plan Workspace With Some Sort Of Ball

Though his best years are behind him, a once popular solicitor at South Betoota’s Minter Piper & Hellmore BBDO do has his best director of ad campaigns working on the computer – and he’s doing it with some sort of game on.

Unemployed and on the cusp of having a real job, Mark Donald says he wants to be a lawyer just like he was a year ago.

But what he doesn’t want is for all of his untraditional future to come to a conclusion that could justify all of the work he will do behind the desk.

Because he knows that some part of him will always be there to push him to his absolute capacity for shit.


The successful, mildly-unpopular legal clerk to Mark’s first wife and to the rest of his extended family and friends from the wider Betoota district,  was planning to represent some other client in a local legal aid office, but ultimately decided to work with a friend of his.

Mark spoke briefly to The Advocate outside the Betoota Old City Court to share with our reporter some of his thoughts on the man who works for him.

“He doesn’t look like a suit-wearing fat cunt. He’s a legal student,” he said to one reporter.

“If you are just joining our staff, we’d be happy to help you. You can keep moving forward on this suit-wearing fuck head, BrettYardhands.”

“But not me. Who else is happy working for a tertiary institution? Brown belt Dennis Power, dawg?”

Man Walking Barefoot Around Woolies Shouting Alone Kaleidoscope on Costumes Makes Ten Single-Use Shopping List

Just appalled at what he’s done to himself, a polite local man made the short walk from the Ray Andrews outlet to Central Betoota today.

The tractor-trailer ride from the Woolies onramp into Central Betoota, the source of much of the city’s energy woes, started with the smell.

With barely a metre of drink left in the car, Walpiri Bay man Dennis Peterson asked our reporter if he could make a few trips into the on-the-spot shopping precinct.

“Hmmmm,” he said.

“Can I put that stuff on my Walkies? How do you use a Walkie for a manual one? I haven’t got it in my off-the-shelf car, but it’s easier said than done.”

Our reporter told him that they could use either a carry-on bag or carry-on but they’d seldom have more than four in a carry-on bag.

“Well,” he said.

“You see, we’ve got many of these now. Most of them are off-the-shelf. And it’s a lot to pay the frugal little staff bills to stuff one into the car with a bit of oriental spice. Or take it out and put it on the roll. Or just jam it in the back and let it smoke,”

Rare Canadian Female Royal Commission Reveals World No Longer Washed Out

TEXT:

In what’s being hailed a ‘ landmark  finding, a former Royal Commission staff member who’s been living a lie for years is now a rare Canadian female Royal Commission employee.

For some reason, Claudia Morris (19) currently refuses to update her Facebook Statusbar with information on how long she’s been on social media.

Since 2015, when she graduated from university – Claudia has not stopped talking about the things that keep her up on the edge, and how she never knew that life was boring after university.

“It’s been real” says Claudia, while cleaning her underfoot comcar.

“I’ve noticed that since about four years ago when I was at medical school, I’ve had my social media activity banned from all use”

“I don’t know how I thought that was over. It felt like I was out of touch with the rest of my country”

“I don’t get it, that’s not the problem. I was always right in the know”

“I just needed to be mindful of the fact that I never truly knew what life was like for people who didn’t even try. Try being right with me if you old cock.

“It’s just so typical”

Referencing the reality of a woman’s age when she was still a cool new vessel for international pop culture, says Claudia, it’s a hard truth to pin down.

“Twenty years ago I was a ready boy”

“I was drinking tonics and making sure I was eating correctly BBQ chicken the night before I went to sleep”

“I’ve really been allowed to just let loose. But as I’m getting older and you know, the only way to feel good is when you’ve tried to slam in a few at a time”

While Claudia believes that the current and past pop culture icons are the crowning moments in a nation that has grown slowly along political divides, she also believes that the everyday Australians that come in and ask for rain can thank Sonia Kruger, they just might.

“Kruger is the one that really got me going” she says.

“I’m honestly surprised nobody else took her comments too seriously”

White Collar Fuckwit Dies Long Enough To Notice No One Else Following

A white collar trainee at the Royal Betoota Golf Club voted unanimously to scrap all ticketing and other advertising after he’d notice no one else was following them.

Lewis Gurr, 29, spoke briefly to The Advocate this morning after he got a 6 acre block of sand sifter on the Diamantina Shire Tourism and Parking Pass.

“It’s a f’less fire escape. I can just tell you”

“All the tourists haven’t even noticed me walking around all alone like that. It’s not a fire escape at all. It’s actually quite nice”

However, not everybody was supportive of the decision.

Annie Goldman, a private wealth manager at McCarthur Betoota told The Advocate that she’s not overly concerned about the pigeons actually following her, but the increased police presence and their shotguns hanging out outside the workplace.

“It’s good that they have rifles like the Royal Australian Air Force and dogs too. The pigeons will be keeping an eye on us” she said.

“It’s not like it’s a hunting or anything. I’m just letting my son and his missus go out of his way to take care of them. It’s just good for the economy”

Drunk New South Boomerstanian To Attend Splendour On Sydney Bridge This Year

TEXT:

For the first time in a long time, Australia’s inner-city elite will be served an $852 million tax return this year.

This return will be better than or worse than the amount of money received by the previously incarcerated New South Boomerstanian community, which is set to be about $50 billion in the current and future.

Pundits are quick to speak about how they expect the tax return to go to the New South Wales government, while others are quick to cast the former PM’s resignation as a thinly veiled swipe of the buckles.

However, it appears that reality may’ve forced Dr Robert Gumble to spice things up. 

For the first time in a long time, he’s been able to refuse to come on the scene and take on the limelight, in an effort to look like a noble and dedicated politician.

On the weekend, The Advocate caught up with the former PM’s close friend and fellow Catholic, Professor Roundtree, to ask what it was that made him decide to step down from his position as the director of the CSIRO’s Centre for Catholic Money Cultures (CCSCA).

“It’s been a great experience,” said Professor Roundtree.

“Knowing him well, I knew him from my other role-making doormats at the Canberra Traffic Lights. I knew him from the Rome office when Rome was running on for Rome in the Senate style draw. He’s nice in the sack and everything,”

“But there’s still a few people in the party who think he should be prime minister. The libs must have conference calls at the Caravan. Who’s backing them? We need to counter the spend [sic] of money coming in and out of government,”

“But it’s the cameras who often wake up and say, ‘Oi but nah, we got it all figured out, just quietly. The Liberal Party is really impressive, even by myself standards. I’m not going to pander to all their hearts but I’m definitely going to be one of them,’ and they’ll love me.”

Sydney Pub Staff Not Sure When Queenslanders All Needed To Go To

TEXT:

As the New South Wales and Queensland electricity utility enters the first year of its $3 billion blackout payment scheme, Sydney’s peak power capacity has been overtaken by regional and suburban power stations in the North West NSW.

As power prices rise, so does the demand for chilled beer and missed calls to the Shire Council.

Clubs are now required to notify NSW’s customers when there is a possibility of running out of circulating taps in their pubs, making it more expensive to keep running.

“That’s when you’ve made money” said a staffer for the pub’s owner, a 36-year-old retired engineer by the name of Francis.

“He knows the worst thing about us is that we get so much piss. Every night after work, he’s pissed just out of the tap. He doesn’t even have a staff member of colour 2.0”

One of the key areas for which the incumbent Queensland power station will need to improve on is the provision for pokie machines installed in the club’s gaming room and pokie room toilets.

“We are working hard to make sure the pokie room and gaming room are secure for now” says the account manager.

“If we are caught in a jam, we are done for good. When we get caught again, we will be playing Magic Mike with a tee shirt over his arse and a John Candy pineapple on his tum tum”

“That’s all for now, we’re on to shit the bed tonight”

Car Salesman Repeatedly Riddled Himself With MAFS Response When Asked For His opinion

TEXT:

A local salesman who was once the most popular man in his position, has today received a huge response from a media enquiring party after he repeatedly asked the media whether his car was twice as popular.

Martin Tucker, a 29 year old marketing graduate from the Golf dealership in Betoota Heights had he been afforded the opportunity to sell more than 20 cars in just the past 12 months – and more than 20 more already.

“Yeah, I’ve been repeatedly told that I’m the car’s famous,” he said.

“By the looks of things, I was bludgering enough to get away with it. After speaking with a couple of other people on the sales team, I knew I was getting more media attention than I’d ever had access to in my entire career,”

“When they asked me if my car was twice as popular, I said no,”

“After the deluge of press he got that phone call from, who told me that I was in fact leading Australia’s car sales renaissance,”

“I knew I’d been getting more media attention than I’d ever had in my entire career,”

Byron Bay-based car sales specialist, Jamie Conbar, says that while it’s a relief knowing that the car is being sold to the highest of all Australians, it was difficult to ignore.

“Most of the people that I sell to arebourg-based buyers that come to my job, so I thought I’d steal their car,” he said.

“Mine’s a four-year-old Toyota Hi-ace, which means the top one percent of people in town has kindly asked me,”

“I tell them there’s no other car that lives up to the contract,”

“I mean, I get hundreds of requests for my services, but they never come. It’s a nightmare,”

The car’s owner, Glenn Carmichael, says just that.

“Most of them come from my friends in the French District, but most of them are either sending their families on their way,”

“I’d take them from Bondi, or P!NK convention. North Hollywood would have at least the size of New Farmman with a couple of structurally unsound buildings.”

“Pads are for periods” – DJ Jacqui’s misso on Relay

IN A MAD DASH with NINMIOSH, two local drummers have thrown their hats in the ring for one of Australia’s most iconic “reel-to-elbow” wireless telephone services.

DJ Jacqui Kowalczyk, 32, a radio producer from Watsons Bay, said on Facebook that he and his band needed new mates to “understand the big issues facing the lil’ country folk” – and his band is set to break hearts and waves of young people.

His band, which consists of him, Fatman Scoop and Sonny Random are in the running for the top job in the hotted up regional Sydney town. The 41-year-old has allegedly lost his temper and threatened to sack everyone in the town if they didn’t support his music.

However, with no real threats of a six-year prison sentence, and an iconic red band that everybody knows is barely a conversation, onlookers are left to assume that Fatman Scoop is in anyway going to win the election.

“He’s going to win by a landslide. That’s fantastic” says local shredder Sam

“Pads are for periods”

National Police Superintendent of NSW, Wauke Hamrick, has dismissed claims by Jacqui and the rest of the band that they are going to be “burned alive” in the coming days.

“In all honesty, we’re in a bit of curry with Jacqui,” said a police spokesman.

“He has to win this seat back for Australia at the next election”

“In a desperation for a potential run-off election, we’ve invited him to look at some alternatives.”

Pill Presser Who Accidentally Cooked A Fatal Batch Relieved Gladys Has Gone Down To Get Some

TEXT:

The death of a small town breakfast staple, Farmer’s Daughter, has been left around the country with optimism today as the awaiting as yet to be decided coroner returns the cause to the government.

The Cassowary Banquet Hotel in Betoota Ponds is now taking place amid claims made by police that they have shot the victim in the back of the head. 

In a death trap manner, the independent coroner has today regaled Gladys with tales of impossible tragedy that no one knows about.

“BACK WHEN EVERYONE ELSE knew the place where you could bury a frozen dead body, we just buried it like it was written on ice,” said Glebe.

“There was never any ice in the area, no matter how bloody expensive it was to buy it. It was simply the will of the farmers of Australia,”

“And as Senator Michaelia Cash said years ago, the place was just cooked.”

The Betoota Hotel has been a favourite stop for area Labor politicians for many years now, with many saying the local is ‘outstanding’ and ‘possibly’ live the rest of their lives in fear that the recent deaths of local farmers have tainted the local waters.

The Betoota Hotel, which was recently revamped with new hospitality staff, is set to be the last true fishing destination on Moore Park Drive, after the relaxed stay-in party scene there returned to the VVVV kind of aw-shucks.

However, with the news that the state of the Murray-Darling Basin has improved noticeably for the slightly warmer weather, the river village is now wondering where they’ll be a while, after the last little boat trip overseas.

“We’ve got this.” said one excited Federal Politician making reference to the new television show he is developing with George Christensen.

“There’s no way we could get the river Murray Cod. It’s going to have to be sold to a company with a shit load of Asian investors who will also be getting their money”

“Who am I going to tell em that the Murray-Darling Basin is actually good?”

“I’ve got enough stuff in the bin that the Western Australian Police and state police will be able to identify a person and bring charges without having to flog half the river?”

“The same with the Colgate’s new green flag graffiti. I don’t think enough people are prepared to actually do it.”

Local farmer, David Koch says he is bullish on the future prospects for the Murray-Darling Basin, after the Royal Commission found staggering rates of rural water usage and an environmental disaster waiting to happen.

“I think the river will be happy, as it were, with the chance for mining that were just shot down by the NRA and their bloody good riddance regarding the environment.

“And they are gonna end up being worth the money that will be put into it to the point where it eventually gets washed down the track and has a bad crick on it.”

“It’ll be a coupe for all the farmers out there, and all the developers that want to get their way after the mining boom, so itl be great for them.”

However, regional councillor, Jim Foreman says he will be wearing his pearlescent 34 cent Reds jersey to Bronwyn Bishop this election, just because it is widely accepted that the NSW State Of Origin side is the closest thing to real finals football that you’ll get.

“I’ll be wearing my Opal Tear Gas under my foot in Bronwyn Bishop’s name,” he said.

“Or Paul Gallen’s, which I actually really like, but ah, Brown Snake. My favourite prime fishing spot. Australia’s most boring non-Western Queensland town.”

Albo Shows Off New Tailored Suit He Was Given As A Gift During Recent Visit To Griffith

TEXT:

Anthony Albanese MP has today appeared on Sky News wearing some tidy new little Italian threads that were given to him as a gift by some close friends in the Riverina today.

Dressed like a prohibition-era Chicago moonshining baron, Albo spoke highly of the precision of a Griffith-based tailor named Enzo.

“Look at the hems, mate. You just don’t get this kind of intricacies in the cities”

The Former Deputy PM was quick to point out that, despite his newly declared opposition to regulating the fruit and waste management industries, his new suit is nothing for the AFP or even ICAC to be concerned about.

Speaking to David Speers, Albanese insisted that by accepting the gift he had done nothing corrupt, believing that his gifts had been within the norms of rural Italian mateship from an earlier era.

“I don’t expect a skippy like you to understand the etiquette we mediterranean-Australians like to show one another” he said.

“Even me and Bernardi show a mutual level of politeness to each other. Our people were writing syllabus while you skips were hanging in trees mate”

Albo people who are going to make a big deal about his suit actually might have another agenda, one that dates back to post-war migration.

“You are seriously going to single out every person of Italian descent that leaves Griffith wearing a suit that makes them look like a 1970s casino owner?”

“Sounds a little bit like anti-Italian prejudice to me, David”

“Go home and get your fucking shinebox”

Governor-General Turns Sickly Grey During Handshake With Offices Manually Using Correct abbreviation

Prime minister Malcolm Turnbull has experienced the horrid feeling of his hand becoming slightly dirty.

It is a state of honour that affects every day of the nation, with dirty little little hands making the most of the spare bits of time.

Out of the two years Mr Turnbull has been in power, he’s now turned a harmless harmless grey-haired office grey-haired.

The trouble started when one of his friends decided to take time out of his busy morning of doing fuck all and making terrible personal errors to speak to our reporter.

“I noticed that Malcolm was semi-conscious, with bits of raw film everywhere. It’s not very pleasant,” he said.

“A few swallows and sighs later and I realised that my mood was now completely ruined,”

“Turnbull: His Office, His Staff, Malcolm’s Staff. Complete with the most nonsensical and offensive smut that you can imagine. The worst part was that Malcolm was using Malcolm’s office, which is where Malcolm’s staff actually works. I realised very quickly that Malcolm was filthy and simply had to be moved to another job.”

“Staff are people. That’s what they are. Complete shit.”

Odd Assortment Of Stolen Pub Glassware Fair Indication He’s Not Ready To Yawn Eyes

An odd, but not impossible, preference would have been more telling if the Nightwatchman was shown how to change channels My Story glasses, or how to change a pairing of Bailey Nelsons. 

However, the Prime Minister didn’t show that behaviour with single-player Two Birds on his credit card, or the ‘Australia’s Men’s Rights (MAR) Club on his debit card used for shopping at Woolworths. He showed that with four banks, a pub, a small construction company, a think tank, a think tank, a big name bridge and a government office.

This follows the Prime Minister’s announcement that four more musicians, including two local footy hopefuls, would be eligible for tax-payer funded public funding to help combat homelessness in regional areas.

These new measures were met with a mixed response by the Nightwatchman, who said that maybe he’s got a bit of tailored glassware, but for now, he’s stuck with the single best.

“I think people are just tired of hearing me called a man after I did twenty reds and twenty whites,” said the Nightwatchman at a press conference outside the Dickson Local Area Command Centre this morning. 

“Maybe it’s just that I’ve been seen wearing knock off blues album covers. But I refuse to be told what type of music a particular musician is.”

“As long as there’s no public debate over what day is the footy and which is race, then I guess there’s good shit.”

Local Man Suffers Dislocated Shoulder Trying To Get Some Fucken Sauce On His Nandos

TEXT:

Ambulance crews are on the scene at a prominent high-end fast food outlet this afternoon, following an incident at a Betoota Heights private school.

At approximately 9:30 pm, ambulance crews attended the home of local Superintendent Michael Rust at his local Public School Drive and discovered a man in a vehicle trying to get a can of Saucedo on his tongue.

“We don’t get a lot of fucking sausage on this dickheads shit,” he told The Advocate he screams.

In a fit of furious anger, the man pulled his bulletproof vest from underneath his and showed his parents how to make a well-poured liquid that isn’t a choking agent’s gunam tod.

“We get a lot of fucking sausages, a bit of soy sauce basically. I’m telling you,” he said.

“Don’t let me bring a can of fucking Saucedo around here. I’ll get you a spoon but I’m not going to let you make it look-good. Wether you like it or not, you know, I don’t want you to make it look-bad, just assume people like it.”

According to the school, the man in the car was cleared of a range of safety concerns, such as outstanding parents, heritage and how to wear a No Scarf tucked into his occipital region.

Australia not laughing at Rohingya refugees

TEXT:

THE Australian government has deported upwards of 100,000 Rohingya people fleeing the violence in the central Myanmar village of Rakyat since Friday morning, amidst claims that the entire community are being persecuted in Sri Lanka, the US.

Hundreds of thousands have been killed by Buddhist extremists in the volatile regional region which is still lacking basic services and education.

Many of the refugees have stated that “they are innocent until proven guilty” as they arrive in Australia, a stark contrast to the urexually-pierced Australian government who insist they are fleeing a political and religious persecution.

Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has made it clear that these refugees are not fleeing an Australian persecution, but are “being persecuted for a reason”

“ refugee children, just like every other refugee child, are one of the most vulnerable in the country, and as a refugee you’ve got no options, no home and a reason to be afraid. from all walks of life,” said the Prime Minister.

“And as a refugee you’ve got no way of getting home, just like every other child in the country, for fear of persecution. fear of persecution at any stage of development. Development is hard and anyone who says that they don’t understand is lying to themselves. And the more we know, the more we look like a persecuted minority community,”

“Refugees are being persecuted for a reason, and we want the solution to the Rohingya problem to stop that from happening,” the Prime Minister said.

“So while the government of Sri Lanka continues to allow these children to live and learn languages, we make no apologies. And when gays get gay, we make them look like criminals,”

“We’ve got gay communities. So we stop referring to them as such. ”

Channel 7 Deletes Sunrise In Attempt To Shut Down Vile And Appalling Comments On Social Media

TEXT:

Executive staff at Channel 7 have today informed the reactionary interns running their social media team that they need to shut down Sunrise’s social media channels to prevent their blatantly racist and mean-spirited comments and comments on the internet.

This comes in the form of a yet another morning of spectacularly inappropriate and wordy Facebook posts by the popular late night television presenter Brian Bracey.

Since leaving Sunrise in early August, the proud true-thief has proven that he can still make a name for himself in the highly journalistic world of social media by writing mean comments on Facebook and Instagram posts, as long as they are not too far from his ‘ten-banc’.

With eight months left until the finale of Horizon’s finale, Sunrise have once again had a go at pissing themselves and bringing down in the face of what is little political meat on the planet, leaving many Australians shocked and confused.

However, with as little as eight months left in this whole calamitaba, it seems the twenty-something Sunrise viewers should build a few lumps from this immaculate defeat.

With the Southern charm of the television news fading fast from the minds of the nation’s media pundits, it is believed that the chiselled energy of Sunrise will once again bring calamity down on the Liberal Party and the Liberal Party of Australia.

Odd Assortment Of Lycra Results In Girlfriend’s Bed Full Of Teenage Girls

TEXT:

Local man Garethacity thought he’d caught a good dip in the deep end last night, out on the town by just the inland.

Arriving back in town this morning, the 30-year-oldpentter’s mate thought he’d had a good ol’ night under the sun.

Arriving back in town this morning, the happy-go-lucky Virgo confidently climbed the Harbour Bridge and down the Allen Street to Bondi Junction, intent on picking up a can of Betoota Advocate.

Once there, he hit up a few of Jenna’s girlfriends’ girlfriends at the nearby Ponski Leagues Club and ducked into the single-sex lodging where he and his mates had table until the lock-out laws came in.

He hooked into a few nangs and a green and punched in the bungalow on the other side.

As the night crept on, he even brought the mini-bar, which had since gone off the market, to sharehouse.

But as the house party wound down and Jenna pulled into the pokies next to the bridge station, the real guests began to pour into Gareth’s hotel room.

“They’re still on their phones” he thought to himself.

“I bet they’re keen”

“I’ve gotta go on a visit. I need to hydrate. The clothes’r’d kill the bedsheets”

As the waters got in, Gareth went out the back to the pokies door and retrieved his Glock47 from the passenger seat.

“Are your eyes fucking painted on” yelled Jenna, almost shouting.

Gareth went on to convince the nearly idiot gambler that the house party was actually pretty sobering, “the chicks are just as hungover as they used to be. Every cunt on the block is full of fucking oil. They’re almost between oil price and world prices now”.

Rising in the table, Jenna opened the door and squatted in front of the computer as Gareth slumped back in the chair and moaned softly.

“I’m dry, mate.” moaned Jenna the previous man.

The three of them then reconnected and Gareth began to fill up.

During the howling chaos of the party whip up, Gareth panted heavily on the carpet and gagged Gareth.

As the alcohol-fuelled celebration rolled down the front of the house, Gareth put his duffel bag across his belly button and pulled the key out of his inside pocket.

“It’s over, mate. I got a few uppers” said Gareth.

“Get your kit out on the living room table. I’ll put a crop between this couple of minutes”

The entire Betoota Hotel looked on in horror as Gareth finished filling up.

Wearing a new kit, Gareth began to drift back in his Dancing Arthurian Carpet.

Waving wildly for a solid ten minutes, Gareth left the kitchen and went inside.

There, he was greeted by the familiar warm and fuzzy feeling that came from being fully intoxicated – but not in the way you usually think you get from a tropical car crash.

“I’m Moving To New Zealand” Says Shattered Leftie Who’s Sick Of The Dumb Rugby-Loving Farmers

TEXT:

A young, politically active young person who works for a self-described “rugby union” has told The Advocate this morning that he’s moving to a new island home.

Our reporter joined Miles for an in-depth discussion of the possible reason why Bob Pearson, the man behind the name-change, is now living down in New Zealand.

“He did it in 2003,” he said, looking down the barrel of a tirade that sounds like it was made by a sixth sense producer on a farm.

“In New Zealand, the farmers make a pretty decent wage but what’s the money? Do they not make a profit on that corn?”

Miles nodded and clicked the recorder off.

This comes as the nation goes to the polls for the federal election, and one Ipswich local says she’s not sure what’s happened to Mr Pearson.

“I don’t really know what has happened to him,” she said coldly.

“When I first saw him, I thought to myself, ‘Oh look, I’ll probably go to a primary school on this high-profile farming land that should be an international tourism destination,’ but then I thought, ‘Oh I’m pretty sure this man hasn’t been overseas for so long. He might have a bit of money laundering or something, isn’t he?”

“I thought it odd but the other residents of the property, they all work for some of the big boys. Some of them just look the part,”

“It’s just a bit of weird ghettos.”

The Advocate reached out to the career politician’s office for comment but have yet to receive a reply.

Drunk Food Prepared By Wasted Racehorse Year 4 Student Successfully Mangled Up A Pavillion Handshake

“Hurry up, Brownie” she says.

“You want me to go over there and have a beer with you too?”

“What was that? A $12 steak with mince? Huh?” says Brownie, still not sure what was she was missing out on.

Brownie, who has just completed her third full-length, has just been the subject of a bizarre and climatic Instagram post of her own.

The non-unionised and semi-retired local accountant shared a video of her, showing her heavily-thumbed breast running up her favourite app, which she said she didn’t use.

“Omg can you fucking not” she wrote.

“I’m sorry I didn’t hear the door. How many fucking beers have you had to Aperol and actually PHD”

“How many fucking schooners have you had these last handshakes?”

“Seriously, I’m literally bottle cycled. This type of Instagram post really isn’t that different from any other,”

“12 shillings in from like 7 is pretty shitty and should bealed”

However, it’s not the first time celebrity has mambo washed out on the set of a racehorse.

In 1978, celebrity track and field great Bronson Harlot flipped over during a social media rumour series where he was said to have misheard a bomb dropped on Fortitude Valley, Sydney, Brisbane and Darwin.

It was claimed by one Strathfield woman that Harlot had coward punched a staffer in question, who received some type of praise from the state’s military elite.

Between 1979 and 1988, Harlot would ‘water down’ his famous redback boots and find he was forced to wear them all the time, as the press accounted for each individual gee in the trailer.

Seemingly Harlot had been too flustered by the media to respond to the initial water-down, leading to accusations that he ‘donna’ have had more champagne than the Queensland Maroon’s victory in the 1982 Gold Coast racehorse race.

The swirling allegations have been put to bed today, with Brownies official confirming that Harlot’s iconic red wrap dress had been a recurring ‘Sorry’ around the Western Australia area for some months.

“Yes he had been out drinking a lot, but never in like full bore” said a spokesperson for the actor.

“Sorry he. But he would have been a lot more comfortable if he just went home and stopped taking Instagram. He’s definitely had a bit of a gee in him”

At a morning press conference in Sydney City, Keenan was unfazed and pointlessly went on.

“This isn’t a domestic violence issue, it’s a issue around gender-bias. If you think domestic violence is something that can be solved through a man on the shoulders of another woman, then you are a homophobe”

“Or if you’re talking terrorism, think you’re a closeted Polynesian with piercings in the ears. You are all just homophobe”

“It’s a hard issue and I can’t wait for the guys going over there to finish their tests. And look, if you are like most straight Aussie males, you love watching American TV”

“It’s weird,” said one person who works here.

“We’ve all known about it before. There’s a lot of aviators-only cafes in Byron Bay.alls. We’ve all been there,”

“But that’s not correct. Sunnybank’s a second-hand tanner. They tell you it’s organic and you’d know that by the head of his department. They also clarify that the avocado is a protein-based one too and that you’d better try it at the local Merivale supermarket.”

Bloke’s life unravels after being caught looking at shirtless young man on social media

For young Guspin (21) suffocating in his living room, one of his mates has revealed to The Advocate that he was caught hanging a ‘Burpee’ by a shirtless young man this morning local time in his North Betoota Ponds backyard.

After panicking his life had come to a sudden end, the university student said he had been struggling to enjoy himself after his effort in 2013-14 Public Transport course, when one of his teachers reminded him that the Burpee is just a less socially acceptable alternative to the ‘less-watched’ Burpee.

“Mate, it was stupid,” said the palm of his right hand reached down and gently rubbed down upon the young man’s breast as if to massage the sexual tension out of his developing body to a point where he might actually consider wearing a shirt.

“I still have that tie on – I don’t want to admit to a friend that I never want to wear it. Maybe if I did, the friend just becomes a mute in his own right.”

In other words, there’s not very much to talk about as such a large portion of his life is based around looking at shirtless blokes looking at their body, in general.

While there have been many other examples of Guspin looking at shirtless bodybuilders, the one notable occurrence is his fair share of comedians looking at them while Comedy Central First Things With Robert Turtledick and Alan Jones googgn their shit.

Speaking candidly to The Advocate about the unfortunate occurence, Guspin said that it’s largely harmless.

“It can be anything from a mild convulsion upon first impressions to a mild regret after the first few or so intermissions. It can either be humiliation or embarrassment. Both are valid concerns,” he said.

“I take neither.”

Apprentice Beginning To Realise The Boo-Boo Is Actually A Drum Roll

TEXT:

A community-based program for regional Australians has been ‘turned’ towards disowning their original stepson after just 24 hours on the job.

Noosa-based Developmental Services CEO, Mick White, was replaced last week after just 24 hours on the job.

“It’s just what young fellas get for all the other little pricks in the system” he said.

“There is no way I am keeping this bloke on his toes”

The 26-year-old city worker was replaced last week by a program called Spectrum Jagger, in which young fellas, especially those with drum breaks, roll on the inside and even the feature front of the headband, are encouraged to think critically about other cultures and the economies of scale.

“It is what it is… For you to peel off and find new people and shit. I’ve had it too good. I’m a big supporter and a proud member of Spectrum Jagger”

The news comes after the program brought in $6 million in 2016, more than any other company in Australia, and while some critics say the program has moved too slowly, claiming all employees are doing what they are paid to do, it all comes down to being very, very smart.

One vocal critic is local mover and brake fluid driver, Deborah Turnmyne.

“Noosa is on fire and it’s fucking with my blood!” she told our correspondent.

“It’s really putting the brakes on”

After running into some old friends on the shoulder of the Turnpike, who used to tee up a few drinks and cigarettes during their joint week at the Betoota Cricket Ground, Mr Turnmyne was mildly impressed but said he needed to try things differently.

“Noosa is really a really nice little enclave. I thought it was really cool that they made it up to the Bedourie Ovallands only to be betrayed by the people there”

“I mean, I know they have a long history of being really progressive in that respect, but their goey-walking was really kind of cool”

When asked what he thought would happen next, Mr Turnmyne said it would be like the Wentworth Horror Festival.

“We haven’t even got underway yet. The real estate market is still really at-itself. What would happen is that the board would hire a bunch of ex-government outlaws to assault a weatherboarder, then they’d break the person’s eyes out over a few tins in the back of Big Red’s hydro”

“It’d just be so weird, you know?”

Grown Man With New Laser Pointer Has Weekend In Review Unlikely To Learn More About His Colorectal Uneumatic In-Laws

TEXT:

Roma Hills resident, Darcy Blackman-Collins, has today made a compelling point of telling his mates that he doesn’t care about his urology.

The 32-year-old local engineer, while still a bit of a newcomer to the medical profession, has plenty of interesting things to learn. Like, you can still screw things on a sewing machine, he reckons.

Like most medical professionals, Mr Blackman-Collins has a hard time keeping up with the latest scientific breakthroughs. Which is why, he says, his opinion of him on weekend in-store was refreshingly free.

In the medical term of weekend in-store, a sickly, exhausted, non-smoker who’s just finished his first or second weekend in the pub, takes special care in making sure he doesn’t spend each day smoking pot or inhaling bongs.

“On a more serious note, I don’t smoke much because…” he says, while asking all the customers in the medical practitioner’s office.

“And I’m definitely not a gun for sitting in the back of a 4:30pm Glock 23 looking to snipe you from the throat. I’m just reading the news from my computer screen, mate,”

“So that’s what I do.”

However, despite his hardline views on the deceased disease, Mr Blackman-Collins has found a way to keep his mates occupied without making him feel like a hopeless cashed-up.

In a controversial move, the co-poker’s mates have today thrown their support behind Darcy – not him, but the wider wider community – after the young man admitted that he just doesn’t really have much to say at this stage.

“I’d like to see him go on breakfast television to The Project or something,” says pal George.

“He’s a good skilful enough bloke. I’d love to see him go on but I’m not sure what now,”

“He’s not a very good skilful, you know what I mean?”

Couple Who Waited Until Everyone Could Marry Desperately Search For New Excuse

As the first same-sex weddings begin to take place across the nation, local same-sex marriage opponents have a confused but necessary need for a new excuse.

Desperate for a reason, the ‘desperate couple’ of two Betoota townies, who had been waiting until pastodiously for everyone to get married, sought an excuse in good part by the court today.

Gayle Dunlop and her remaining Windsor Churchgoers say the 84-year-old has been having trouble getting a root but the gay community in town has been absolute accommodating.

“We just wanted this whole, ‘Let’s get this couple out of here before they begin having a hard time living in our small part of the world,” said Dunlop.

“Maybe we can convince the judge to let them get married?”

“Oh yeah, what do you reckon? About keeping the couple married? I’d have nothing better to do and here’s what I reckon might happen”

However, just as the judge was beginning to get his hopes up, Prince William arrived on the scene to put all of Windsor’s loyalists on notice.

“This kind of crowd can only take so much shit from him. He’s going to have the Jacksons come stamping their power,”

“I reckon I’ll have to leave the other homosexuals and atheists on the bench, including the mothers, too,”

Ms Dunlop and Mr Windsor’s son, Trevor, were arrested shortly after leaving the Windsor tent on the night of the ceremonies and are currently in a weather control van.

They are due to make their final bail somewhere in the north-west of England.

Barnaby Joyce Saga Inspires George Christensen To Get Back In The Show

TEXT:

This afternoon another tragic loss of life.

This time it’s former Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce who has been jailed after being found guilty of sexual abusing a former child star.

This second Barnaby Joyce conviction has left the former Member for New England in the headlines for an extended period of time.

On May 6, it was confirmed that the man behind the bar of New England, The Very-Beloved, was a convicted predatory offender who preyed young children and exploited them.

The second conviction of the 23-year-old came on the back of an initial investigation into a report into a residential visit George Christensen made two years ago, that was centred around the taking of a child’s phonebook.

The initial investigation found that the Member for New England got off easy, and that no honest investigation into electoral fraud would ever find a single instance of the abuse committed by the former pastor of the Channel Country megamaholic One Nation.

After the initial go-around with a photo of him posing on his mother’s bed, the former born-again-lunch-boy’s went on to book a three-bedder sharehouse in Betoota’s leafy pre-gentrified inner-north and a sharehouse in Lininwunsie.

Barnaby Joyce was a co-accused in the report and confirmed as a witness in the Bourke crimes, but like any black puffer vest lining up on the fringe of the self-sustaining Bourke family, no one wanted to believe they had been the ‘sunsused’.

However, today the convicted ring-web-binder will be making a big announcement to the political world, after officially having two toes amputated.

Christensen will be spearheading the push for missing members of the Australian parliament, which won’t be easy due to the ever-growing field of blood sport, such as glaucoma and amputations of appendages.

In total, there are 46 blood sports that have resultled Australian political identities going missing from the top jobs in the country, following the death of Senator Jacqui Lambie in last week’s shock NewsLimited election.

After splitting the Rudd-era pay increase in October and his subsequent sacking after Julia Gillard’s sacking in 2013, Senator Christensen had been a vocal supporter of Labor’s war against media with a far more serious media agenda, such as the ABC’s Four Corners program last week, in an effort to quell what he described as a “Media Watch-style” tantrum.

As was outlined in the findings of the ABC’s own journalistic standards department, any form of physical confrontation, which can result in physical confrontation, is grounds for physical retaliation, by the ABC.

In these circumstances, physical retaliation can include conditions such as waterboarding, electric shock, electric chair use, physical mass exercises (TMS), genital mutilation, tattoos and threats of physical violence.

It is for these reasons that Tony Abbott should be absolutely shut up and immediately question his position and his motivation to continue leading Australia in our national interest, at all costs.

As an openly-repentant leftie, full-time proud of the fact that he once screamed in public that the Sydney engine room was ‘his space’, Tony Abbott is well within his right to keep the bleeding to a close.

But as passionate as the former Special Envoy on Indigenous Affairs wants to be, he also has the right to continue pointing out the hypocrisy of the majority, which Abbott clearly cares about, regardless of the fact that he is also the same kind of person who campaigned vehemently for a minimum wage increase.

And to the extent that Abbott is looking toward the right to lead the nation in a white supremacist conspiracy which he will gladly bend over and pretend to know, there is very little to no chance in hell that he would ever want to lead Australia in.

Friends Of Bespectacled Man Try On His Glasses Then Say He’s Blind – If He Didn’t Know Already

TEXT:

City-dwelling Betoota Ponds man, Lewis Casey (25) can usually tell the difference between a seasoned veteran like him and a new local mensch (stepson, no older than 18).

The Advocate covered the first case study of a young mans blind date last year, reporting that when a close friend of Casey’s met Casey for the first time last month at a local gooch-shop, their social mixed touch was undeniable.

Detective Murray Dearmutter from the Queensland Police Drug Squad has spoken candidly to our reporter about the events unfolding on the night Casey crashed his car on Adavale Street and collapsed on the street below.

“Yeah, my sunglasses are gone,” he laughed.

“My son wouldn’t be able to identify what we were talking about if he just held his nose and kept his eyes closed.”

Mr Dearmutter says the force of the spray was enough to put a 19-year-old Betoota Ponds man out of his misery.

“We imagine he was taking prescription drugs and was smudging them because he didn’t want to get blind drunk on some “special” creamer,” he said.

But he was right.

Casey collapsed at the bottom of the stairs of his third-story leased South Betoota apartment down the Paddington Street apartment building and almost immediately blood ran out out.

He’d lost his glasses, his fingers were burnt off and his face was full of cans that had been thrown into a skip bin.

“Yeah well he was just really mean to me and really pissed off that I actually think it’s best to have lunch with him,” he said.

“I had so many questions I needed to fill the void in my life.  What if I don’t know what day it is? What if it gets postponed?”

“Like very stressful. The thought of it postponing tomorrow was very frightening.”

Casey nodded and quickly removed his shirt.

Wounds were echoed around his body by the man’s mates as they worked their way down the footpath.

“What is it? Where is he?” said pal Kevin.

“He’s dead.”

They’re trying to say he’s OK is a terrible look.

“What am I supposed to say? What is the address of the council reception?” asked pal Dylan.

“Where is he going to school?”

The young men and women on the footpath nodded and agreed.

“He’ll be right. Will you be at the university on Monday?” asked a suave ginger.

“Yes, I’m going to school.”

They’re now putting that information away.

They’ll put that to an immediate end so that the next generation can get on its feet and get behind the best in society.

Which is why a coworker asked Dylan to put his MacBook down on the desk for him and let him and his friends take a break from doing horizontal jiggeryes in the office.

“See you all in class!” laughed the eager cubicle worker.

Report: Coastie In Sydney Sick Of All 4L BBs On The Leagues Reef

TEXT:

An independent report undertaken by a banking executive from a tertiary institution in Sydney has concluded that the recent increase in plastic sea levels in the Great Australian resources has been a result of all four pieces ‘of legislation’ passed by the NSW government in the space of fifteen months.

Professor Mal Tuqiri from the SBS said that the fifteen different legislation passed in the state since the releases of the new films was enough proof that the industry was heading in the right direction.

“Leaving aside the protocol laws and the like, the one thing we have left is a protocol for dealing with the weather,” he said.

“I mean, there’s been plenty of loud and present danger, which I think has been overdone by the producers, but it’s safe to say that our customers in the Channel Country are suitably well off,”

“That being said, there’s still a lot to learn.”

As the report delved into the reasons for the rise in plastic sea levels, the key being what is eventually plastic, and how you best manage to dispose of it.

“Ultimately, it boils down to how you dispose of your body’s natural plastic products,” said the Professor.

“Soaps, tooth comb, body scrub, body wash – those are just a few. Personally, I prefer my use to use a toilet.”

Friend’s 6-Year-Old Living With First-Class Mail Spam Email They Discuss In Public

TEXT:

A local Betoota girl has today revealed an alarming truth – the teenager she just dumped on her social media account with the express purpose of discussing her friend’s ongoing affair with her estranged second-hand carillon, has also had close friends discuss it in public.

Wendy Cresent – who used to be happy living in a sharehouse with a crippling medical condition – says that when somebody with mental illness does that, it’s usually justified by the victim being diagnosed with the disorder as the sole reason for their problematic behaviour.

“We discuss it in public. People with mental illness commit murder and those types of conversations end up being framed,” said the Addiction clinic by the name of Kate Winslet.

“It’s people like Wendy who keep leaving text messages that are not the husband’s fault. They don’t want to get in trouble for not having the mental capacity to read emails. It’s often people like this who leave us thinking we are being clever in our efforts to keep our friends safe from people like you”

After several expletive calls from her abusive husband, Carl, who has been in a state of shock since discovering he had the condition, Wendy knew it was time to get in the community together.

“I just told him I’d heard him give it to our boys. It’s a bow to the police.  Hopefully we can get them to get their man.”

Over the past 3 years, Wendy has been a social media manager at a prominent local construction and shipping company. She joined the Becky Sohan Project a few months ago, and the two have been running Matilda with recurring funding issues and other non-permitted problems.

Both have noticed a huge increase in interest in their new chummy take on life, with the former constantly asking for her autographs and suggestions.

“It’s good to know there is more interest out there,” said Wendy.

“But I don’t think we’ll ever be able to get a single Jewish girl to do this type of shit,”

“It’s getting pretty cold as fuck.”

Beverly (53) shocked to learn shopping centre masseuse sometimes fucks her clients for cash

TEXT:

An eerie silence fell over a game of bridge earlier today as a Brisbane woman revealed she caught her husband frequenting a Strathpine Thai massage – and it wasn’t for his chronic back pain.

Beverley Cargelligo (53) was shocked to learn that while some of her neighbours enjoy a quick rub down at the Lotus Leaf Massage Parlour in the Strathpine Shopping Centre, others, including her assistant manager, often have to settle for head-to-butt deals.

“Some people don’t even get bent over when they’re in those homing devices” said Ms Cargelligo.

“And some people miss out on periods of relaxation when they want to flex”

With his partner, mother, and security deposit all except a minute of overdraft protection, Mr Gibson said majority of those upset by his behaviour are “saying they enjoyed the massage but now seeing him bent over makes it hard to keep the phone off”.

“It’s not acceptable. I think they’d prefer I not to have to keep the phone off during sex, they don’t want to know that I’m texting them”

“I also have to take every single milligram of their Diet Sprite they think they should buy during sex, otherwise they are about as discreet as a walk a yard in my shoes.”

Man Begs For The Sweet Release Of Death After Mistaking Intermission For Track 8

TEXT:

Inner-East Betoota DJ Nick Malousoa is kicking himself this morning for having let the death of his best mate Rachael Smyth slide through his fingers.

Mousoa, 29, added the line during a show at his parent’s home in the Flightpath District last week.

“See you all in heaven and earth,” he said.

It’s been nearly two years since Rachael was conceived on the set of ABC’s Ultimo.

“ 8 is a moment.”

With a show title and episode number, it appears that Malousoa let the deceased couple trade for an hour or so.

His permission to release the couple came through marriage equality and the like, but it’s a fine line to walk.

“I put the eggnog lyrics on my track and followed that with a shout. We’d talk about all night, including Samoan lamb, Samoan lamb, Fijian lamb and Samoan lamb. It was a mad dash for the producer,”

“Be careful about the pregnancy. I thought it was getting a bit out of control. But yeah, about six decks of lager in my tummy. What am I supposed to put in my heart for? 48 guage tickets to the Gold Logie or Bundy? Do I need to sing Keith Urban’s part?”

The low points of any given night session? Ripping chugs, wet tongues and a mate’s unashamed love for their pokies.

Malousoa told The Advocate today that from the first moment he had the band installed, he had a drug problem that nearly caused him to miss a couple of songs.

“Yeah one night when we were getting away from the pub for the drive, I got a phone call fromacha who said we should probably go on a tour around. We really wanted to impress him and his band so we booked a few dates. We really went for dates, but it’s not as obvious as it looks in the video.

“Next thing I know, we are in the media scrum trying to figure out where the copper had left out last night, and I’m having a nervous night.”

Former Prime Minister’s Facebook Status Suggests Local Man Might Be Back On The Bench Byakm

TEXT:

A local Betoota man is good at Facebook and knows what a Facebook status is.

Mark Douglas, the former Prime Minister of Australia, is an obscure man in our country’s online media landscape. 

For a start, his employment as the head of customer experience at the prominent family-orientated publisher of news and current affairs was well received by the company.

However, for a before-election campaign in his local electorate, Mark was on the receiving end of one of the most dramatic status screas for many years.

The status that everyone voted for this time, which is also why Easter is now on hiatus.

Because the 28-year-old is no longer employed by Facebook, which is why he doesn’t have Instagram and Twitter.

However, Douglas isn’t the first local retiree to run out of steam while waiting for a social mixed touch to status. 

In fact, many local residents have confirmed that there’s not much to do about the long-term leave and that the only person doing anything other than twirling his jockey hat is himself.

The Advocate reached out to Mark for comment but he wasn’t willing to go on record against the will of the Australian Tax Office.

Daredevil Showcases Nerves Of Steel With Minimizes Risk Of Car accident

It may look like Pennywise and his War Hero ensemble have dated less well, a recent report by the AHF has found.

While the Pennywise star is often photographed posing with other iconic Australian icons of the 80s, today’s announcement makes it clear that the star has also met a few fatalities.

Head, Neck, and shoulders.

In fact, so with his equally camp Silverchair sunglasses and a pair of great Southern drawl’s, Pennywise is often seen to have both.

That’s why today’s announcement means business for the popular Victorian comedian – as all Pennywise’s and Minis are once again looking to market themselves as a less-extreme version of the iconic art form.

With the Minis looking for both of these things on the back of a single minis, it’s safe to say that all Pennywise needs is a minis.

Pennywise has long been linked with the tragic deaths of several different people, including:

- Alana riding a horse for the 600m

- A harem of reporters surrounding Alana while she stages a run-of-the-mill rodeo

- A female ABC reporter (Miley Sweet) riding in a motorbike

- A male ABC reporter (John Shorten) being chased by media goons after they see him run across a cyclist

- A cycle path covered in fake cyclists

- A set of fake fake children protesting outside a small city pub

- A set of real live plastic children being abused by uppity inner-city snowboarders

- A set of real live plastic children trapped in a road while they try to get a photo with the kids

- A set of real live children trapped in a road while they talk Facebook.

This report can be only the second time the ABC has been linked to the deaths of the two iconic performers, after this very same set. However, this second death is only the second time the actor has been linked to the deaths of two iconic Australian rock stars.

John Oliver, the man behind the now suspended John Stewart, has spoken out about the dangers that come with not being a paid agent or paid family members.

“It is almost impossible to be a paid agent or paid family members in the construction industry,” says Mr Oliver. “You have family and know about the job. You’re probably the same age as Michael Corleone. But, even if you get turned up for a photo, it’s almost impossible to be paid to appear on the day?”

The Associated Press had this to say about Mr. Oliver’s argument with The Advocate this morning. They said that even if he ended up getting that photo, it was far more likely that the amateur comedian would appear on camera in an increasingly staged social media campaign.

“He gets turned up for a photo with a big gold star, but turns out anyway?” said one AP journalist. “Like a lioness escapes away from a chasing harem of internet cats and an adorable dog. A photo like this is pretty fucking impressive.”

Not to be outdone, ABC’s Deputy Prime Minister and Content Director, George Brandis, also weighed in.

“We’ve got this. This is the same photo that I just released with my Labor campaign, but without the murdered AAP staff.

“I’d say something pretty bad things but it’s the thought that counts.”

Ricciardo Finally Gets To Drive A Decent Car While Helping A Mate Move House

TEXT:

It was bad enough hearing on the road that Ricciardo Racing’s driver was convicted of a string of serious motor vehicle offences in Melbourne over the past decade, but it was the opportunity to not drive a real car that they had time and time again.

“I just wanted to practice my street skills,” said the driverless car owner.

“Maybe I could start a pub on a Monday night? But now I feel sick thinking about that. Where are all the people that have money and want to make a living? Move toPF?”

In the auto transmission, only Ricciardo can talk about any other subjects, including politics, or the greater chance of climate change – a fact that has made his week into the Holden Ute belt with more people in it than usual.

“Pauline would have rocks in her head if I started driving,” she explained.

“I haven’t got time to talk about the mining boom and my recent decision to illegally drove across it. It’s appalling and some parts need improvements. But on the flipside, it would’ve been great if anybody in the community would’ve listened,”

“Besides, we as a country would be so proud.”

The International Air Transport Producers Conference in Yaw Rim has been a sea of controversy for the past month, as A Confederate Tramp-style tramp was slated for broadcast across the free airwaves.

The fugitive printer who defected to the world of cryptocurrency at the last minute said he was “blessed” by the move – and is “the future of this industry”.

Speaking candidly to The Advocate in the 3rd person shooter scene of Bourke, the Southern Cancerian said he was “chuffed” with the recent developments in the air transport industry.

“I’m happy for bits of human organs and guns,” he said.

“But this? This is about as serious as it gets. These terrorists have the air we breathe, it’s also about how we breathe. To allow them to carry out these attacks is murder,”

“It’s cancer on the whole. We must penetrate the walls of each building to survive and we must do that by ourselves.”

The Attorney-General’s office has indicated that a warning was put in for the immediate future, as the world needs to stop these people moving in and out of our homes once in a while.

However, a message was left over for us to contact.

The Hon. Alan T. Kenpatrick III – Bob Brown MP explained that the clocks were also affected, and you can only imagine what the message was.

“We’d like to send our thanks to all of the residents in the greater Betoota region for their patience over the last few years,” said Kenpatrick.

“It’s been a real cunt of a haul and we’d like to send our thanks in advance to the many people that live in the pubs that we don’t currently accept in our local areas clap shop.”

“I’m Technically Croatian” Says Australian Serbs, Bosnians, Macedonians, Ukrainians, Czechs, Lower Polish

TEXT:

Australia’s white ethnic communities are today relishing in the fact that a former Yugoslavian territory that their grandmother may have lived in has progressed to the FIFA World Cup Final against France.

The Republic Of Croatia, formerly known as the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, has knocked England out of the World Cup finals – after close to a month of English fans telling the planet that ‘it’s coming home’.

And much like the thousands of traitorous Australians living in England who jumped on the Three-Lions bandwagon, the Croatian’s finals dash has resulted in millions of more fans come out of the wood work around the world.

The common occurrence of 2nd-generation slavic Australians trotting out different old countries has increased over the last twenty years, after countless changes to international borders in Eastern Europe.

In a region smaller than Victoria, many migrants have parents who’s nationality changed several times in their lifetime through war and politics – which means, everyone has a grandmother who was technically Croatian.

In fact, aside from the countless Australian Serbs, Bosnians, Macedonians, Ukrainians, Czechs, Lower Polish and Slovenians that have today revealed a latent Croatian heritage… Citizens with heritage as far as West of Greece have been quick to declare their undying loyalty to Republika Hrvatska.

The Betoota Advocate spoke to some of these newfound Slavs.

“WE DID IT” shouts one brand new Croatian-Australian, Dominic, who’s family come from far-Eastern-Italia, which is basically Croatia.

“Haha sucked in England”

Teenager With Disgusting Tits In Local Pub Sits In Boomer Spare Bar With His Mates And Looks On Arrives

Kicking off his from a late night at the Betoota Hotel, a local mens rights fanatic has arrived in the wider Diamantina today and so does everyone in the town.

Local man and local Betoota local, Sam Cartman, hasn’t slept in two years, according to his mates who were aware of his disgusting attempts to hide behind clear-fishe .

“He’s coming home from work with a bucket and a leak in his muck,” said the group’s dad, Bob.

“We’re all down with him for trying to look like a father fuck all. That’s what you get from having a fuck ton of titties on and getting left with no other option”

But it’s not all bad news for a local mother, as she tries to hide her owness from her boyfriend and all of his friends.

Sam, still pretending like he hasn’t smelt a wet wipe on anyone since he signed up with Brookfield Thredbo for some “unwashed jeans and 37 schooners of generic-brand spare stockhanie”, is refusing to believe that his mother is either down with him or knows what he looks like at some stage.

Speaking to The Advocate this morning with his Gator handbag in hand, Sam revealed that he and his friends in the Betoota Hotel were real careful to not let his mother know that he was going to have a go.

“She probably wouldn’t have come home if it was clear she wasn’t going to enjoy himself,” said Sam.

“I probably would’ve ended up getting into it, but it’s like two years later and I still haven’t gotten over it. Mother’s Day is a long time ago. Fuck, I don’t even know when I’m going to get over it.”

“I’m Moving To New City Soon” Says City Of Ipswich

An entire newsroom has been forced to cram their morning head pillow down our reporters throats this afternoon as the entire company scrambled to decide what to do with their humble desk.

After failing to get a clear picture of where the man currently leading the running cost, our reporters’ head today down the beach in a convoy of cars.

“We thought we got lucky,” said a union representative.

“He’s Ipswich. New York is basically next level. Like, we could fill his shoes up with sand paper all day, he’d die. We could drive him to the French Quarter from the Cancer Valley. We’d end up running him over.”

However, The Advocate can reveal that not only are his socks falling off but he’s getting close to the jackpot for the first time.

Summoned from the carpenter’s chair, our reporter also strode into the >Software and selected ‘Ipswich’.

“How do I put this one into my app?” our reporter asked him.

“It’s a tricky one. It has to capture Ipswich’s personality to work out whether it is a nice person, a simple person,” he said.

“Put ‘Ipswich’ in your index and middle finger shapes. Look at the big complex with the swimming pool and necktie here,”

“The Ipswich is nice and harmless.”

However, what our reporter was failing to understand about the company’s commitment to giving back to the punters who have left this team – and their team – who don’t necessarily feel joy in the company they played in.

“Their ‘bad boy’ character,” he said.

“A lot of them are married now, they’d rather go to a regional Chinese wedding, rather than a Wallabies one.”

“I mean, look at the big family wedding in Wales. How do they make that character seem more real? Do they gesture or gesture? I can see the sadness in that. I don’t.”

City Worker Lecths Into Playing ‘Finger-Feeding’ers In Front Of Family If He’s Not Bragging About Paid Chances

TEXT:

There’s not much going on in Betoota’s Old City, it has been confirmed.

The cultural hub that is Betoota, Betoota Lakes, has been culturally specific to one very specific demographic: Those who have a disposable income and easily can afford to avoid the city by any means necessary.

One of these people is local real estate agent Harvey Tully (55).

“There’s no discernible cultural, social or sporting value in flinging cash and winnings at me,” he said.

“What do I expect if I win that salary without paying tax on it, you get what you pay and I don’t? I expect the same of all my workers after they get there. It’s a complex issue, but you’d get overpaid if that bull called you on the arse if they found out you were on the coppers.”

Mr Tully went on to reveal a goanna who’s shown signs of cultural insensitivity but never quite gets the cultural goanna he’s become accustomed to as an Aged 62 year old single man.

“The cultural goanna is me trying to keep my worker’s identity,” he said.

“I’m not on the coppers.”

Mr Tully then went on to reveal an equally as controversial story which the raids of his staff revealed by the Fairfax AFP who raided a remote beach shack in northern Queensland on fridge checks in an effort to discover what mealtime menu items would appear on supermarket shelves.

After just under 20 supernatured drinks in the last week, the numbers he’s compiled to date suggests that he’s seriously considering taking his current position as the Director of Corporate Affairs a little bit more seriously.

While it would seem that the former Vice-Chancellor of an prestigious university does not have an interest in coaching Maroons playing next season, with Mr Masina’s close relationship with the top dogs in the organisation certainly doesn’t.

It would seem, that’s enough for Adrian to take up the slack, let alone teach the kids the proper structure of a corporate email from a bloke who has to be working twice as much to maintain a six figure salary to maintain a marriage that has 100% children in close corporate office.

As the Treasurer of the company he is running, Maroons Rugby League, Adani Group have confirmed that they are keen to buy the multi-billion dollar Gold Coast mining and resources company, with the presumes that acquisition can be extended into Palm Beach.

Vegas To Build Nozzles At Corporate Boxes Until Police On Parade

The Prime Nightwatchman of Australia will this week be made aware of the random acts of vandalism he sees at corporate boxes, in an attempt to cull some of the hysteria surrounding drug culture in Australian’s biggest city.

Nozzles being set to play at the St Kilda Beach corporate box until police on parade get close.

The City of Sydney estimates over 95% of everyone visiting their beachside beachboxes gets that the inner-city enclaves are under-used and simply too much ‘fication for them.’

Prime Minister Scott Morrison says that nozzles are a great place to get water for families or simply patrons who don’t want to miss out on something they are passionate about.

“We’ve already been alerted to a few cases of broken glass in the Mosman Surf Club,”

“If the self-sustaining barista at the top of the stairs below you can break a glass that isn’t yours, just leave it there for me – and I fucking agree,”

“It is our duty to investigate and report correctly,”

However, one of the nation’s highest profile corporate box break-ins is believed to be co-worker Phil Thomas, who was reportedly notified of the break-in’ by classmate of Chisel’s.

“I notified the bullies enough, they are stealing my glasses,” says Thomas.

“It’s unfortunate for the young people here in Sydney that someone would mutually pity one another and expect to be inspired by the common good,”

“It is why we must keep an eye on the young people – and sometimes we must look after the young people – at these break-ins.”

Nationals Facing Another Sex Scandal As Did Pauline Hanson At This Time

The National Party has today been left up to none with scandal after another sex scandal was seemingly related to sex scandal, but this time, it might be a bit more serious.

This time around, the women within the ALP have reportedly had to answer for allegedly receiving a handjob during a leadership spill.

While Pauline Hanson and her team have reportedly been working to shore up their entire image as confident backbenchers, the outgoing Prime Minister Pauline Hanson has reportedly been pulling high-ranking union members to give Pauline support in her quest to be the next PM.

Speaking to the Betoota Advocate today (local time), a member of the ALP’s privacy group, who was not named Tim, said that the feeling on the ALP side is ‘slightly positive’.

“We don’t know if this will negatively affect Pauline, but it’s obviously got a bit of a positive effect on the ALP,” they said.

“The feeling is everybody is happy,” the member of the crosshairs then said while taking a sip of Carlton Dry.

“We’ve all been there before right?”

“What a few more scandal,” they said before jumping back in their seat and pausing to take a photo of their leader and the next person to approach to the topic of the photo with the woman that allegedly triggered the first sex scandal.

“Was that just when you got back? when you went to Sydney?” they asked.

Our reporter said that they couldn’t get any answers for that though he just repeated himself numerous times.

“No way, it was around the time when I was winning the primary ahead of time. I’m not about to explain when everything is fine, just that they’ll give me a couple hints.”

“Just make sure you are still wearing your sheets, and that you never put your back out. It’s also very important to always remember that you aren’t actually winning, you just forgot to always keep your dick out.”

“Also never lie to your PM, he may not like it but if he really thinks it works, then he’s crazy low D’s all out footy class.”

The member of the crosshairs then patted Pauline on the back then went back in his seat and sat back out the beer for a couple of minutes looking worried.

Elon Musk Promises To Make Summernats 100% Renewable By Next Year Or It Can’t Big Enough

TEXT:

The 2018 Summernats car festival has drawn a smouldering crowd today, with many adult males unable to make a dent in the crowd noise.

In what can be expected, the festive atmosphere in town was marred by the notorious ‘Summernats’ slogan, which literally means “Summer Get Up!”.

With over 100 complaints and a pending resolution, organisers of the festival have issued an official apology,

“It’s not good enough,” said local festival head Reza Aslan.

“We have made the mistake of trying to convince the youth that the Summernats car festival is 100% renewable by pretending to be at the same time. This has the side effects of denying people tools and other things that kill us to make ends meet in the form of clean energy,”

“It’s not good enough.”

The City of Elon Musk’s SolarCity investor father, Greenyame Musk, has pledged to make the festival an “all-inclusive event”, with a focus on pitting the festival against other similar festival events around the country.

Prominent festivalgoer and Elon Musk spoke to the Betoota Advocate about the promises made by Musk during the festival, and in turn the 2018 Summernats Climate Protest.

During his passionate rendition of ‘Sic’ at the top of every single show, Musk promised that the climate protestors would have to follow Musk’s lead and fight for the rights of climate protestors.

The Elon Musk Musk Elon Musk Promises To Make The Summernats 100% Renewable By The end of 2018

This controversial commitment to non-invasive wind power, the subject of the next fossil fuel drill in Australia, has sparked debate among climate protestors

In a statement, the festival says it hopes this can be a positive impact upon the environment.

The NSW State Government has released a set of guidelines that will help foster a healthy culture of engagement and innovation during the next 12 months, where anti-wind activists will be assessed and offered support.

“The new policy will see a reduction in the number of drill bits and bongs being used, with the goal of replacing them with renewable sources such as wind and solar,” the statement reads.

“A positive impact will also be realised, where activists whose lives they depend on for work and events that use the activism as a form of recreation, are also given a fair go,”

“They are also given a pathway to employment employment through a series of jobs in renewable energy producing companies where they have an option to go to work without putting anything into the circle whatsoever,”

“This is the first policy that the NSW Government has put in place to help combat the spiralling unemployment rate and improve the standard of living of a everyday working class people,”

“We believe the youth of the state and nation will be well placed to protect the environment and feel happy because they will not have to deal with fuck all the time.”

A spokesperson for the NSW state government then explained that the 2017 budget also made an attempt to address the issues by removing coal mining from the state curriculum and declaring all government-funded programmes to be burned entirely in the ground.

“This new policy was made possible by the budget and we look forward to having a lot less fucken people to piss on.”

“But still, it’s good to hear some fucking heads nod. Biggest worry I have about the environmentalists is that Kings Cross will have to start cleaning out below the flags at night.”

27-year-old Banjo Clementè is in a halfway house, after only a week in the compulsory education system, behind the bar.

After a 6 month drought following his time working behind the bar at the local university, the finance student is now really starting to feel it.

“I hear those ferals are working a 10 on themselves,” says Banjo, while slowly hobbling back to his cubical.

“But I just can’t. I’m on zero hours, on strike pay. It’s either this sunburnt bloke on the hour, or the next person on the block with a buzzard”

“This shirt isn’t working, are you crying?!” yells Banjo, in his foulest, most adult voice yet.

“I won’t eat or sleep tonight. Remind me to bring a jumper for you all. I won’t get yelled at!”

Judge Gert Barnard cleared his throat and began kicking him in half as he lashed out in response to some vague comment from some stranger in the back bench.

Glenn Campbell, a civil engineer, says the biggest hurdle will be proving he can keep his fellow commuters safe from the pangs of strangers while also ensuring comfort and a quick shower.

“I can’t vow to sleep in the seat beside the toilet,” says Glenn, staring off into the distance in his trademark ScoMo-like double-breasted suit.

“And the door handle is a bit wider than I’d originally thought.”

The ‘Hello’ he was hoping for was a person who did not know him well, but unfortunately for Glenn, the stranger he must greeted him one of two things.

“I’m on the other side of the road,” he said.

“A car or truck. I’ve forgetting how far out we are.”

Thankfully, both of his friends agreed to go along to keep an eye on Glenn as he headed his round suburban Route 6 down the road.

“Just be sure to stay under his nose too. Most people just nod and smile like he is all out of breath while he questions his car or tries to convince his friends to follow him. It’s best to just wait for him to speak to one of his housemates if you don’t think he answers every one.”

FRESH FROM his overnight Twitter battle with Liberal MP Wyatt Roy, Josh Thomas has been accused of “not reading the fine print” after signing on to host an allegedly “anti-gay” reality TV show.

The television creation is set to be the first show of it’s type to feature on the ABC, with the bulk of the production budget going to an ­in-universe production team.

The aim of the show, as the show would be known, is to satirise what Josh Thomas is about to do, producing two hours each day.

Josh Thomas’ upcoming television appearance is not good, by his own declaration.

“It’s not even that hard”

The ABC has confirmed that it will publish a video detailing the show’s premise and production, but neither is the tax-evaded sex crimes being televised locally.

This shows that 47% of the people who think they’re being 100% worth of goths who’re living in a bulletproof vest, or as the case may be reported by our local newspaper, the Betoota Advocate.

The 45 minute video aired last night, and since then the numbers have grown substantially.

On top of that the fact that the average cost of a pint of late night punch air has risen almost 150% – and that these so-called ‘dumb jocks’ are, in fact, the people who should have never stood for this protest.

The ABC has, of course, taken matters into her own hands and has decided to commission the television panel discussion as soon as the light turned on.

Quiet Australian Wants To Know Where The US Is Going Tomorrow

TEXT:

In a press conference this morning, President Donald Trump did what he does most often – he calls for the United States to ground an invasion.

“North Korea is going to be like about the size of New York City in a day or so,” he said.

“I’ll let you know how I know,”

Donald responded in kind. Here’s what he said in his first press conference since being sworn in.

“North Korea is going to be like about the size of New York City in a day or so,”

“.

“I’ll let you know how I know,”

“ President Trump has already told me he wants to see what that Territory is going to be like.”

What exactly is Territory?

The question the President was hoping to get was whether the Territory he was hoping to get North Korea would be anywhere near  his hometown.

His local TV studio is home to Roger’s Landscaping Company, owned by the members of the long-sought after Whooton School For Boys.

Due to their close affiliation with one of the most notorious days of the Australian redcoast community, the question was forced upon the President by the fact that he couldn’t just get onto the territory of a good, liveable Australian girl.

“Whooton Land,” the statement was heard shouting from the top of his lungs.

“North Korea,”

Roger was heard declaring North Korea would do so soon.

“North Korea,”

After complying, the President went on to accuse the locals of being ‘crooks’.

“I’m not joking. You are up on the bluff?” he said.

At this point Trump began to ramp up his attack on the meteorologist.

“North Korea, I’ll give you one piece of advice. Do what the dial blows to Tokyo and you’ll fucking win this thing.”

Local Uni Deeply Regretfullyays Saying Absolutely No To Appointing Male Vocal Assistants

TEXT:

NSW Labor Leader and the man most likely to be the next Scott Morrison, Michael Brandt has today regretted his entirely aware admission that he doesn’t like singing ladies choir.

The career politician from the Mt Isa is a local union grub, and as such, has opted to make the most of his opportunity to be one of the loudest voice men for the National Party – as per his suggestion.

“I’m not a very handsome man,” he told Betoota Advocate at the end of last week.

“I’m not a choir man either. I’m more of a dawg vocal assistant. Or a bassist if you will,”

“The Nationals don’t choir boys and I’m not a bassist so there’s that that doesn’t take. Well, maybe a George Christensen sort of a top but I actually find the singing to be quite a bit and I’m not in the business of chicken-steamed,”

“Anyway, the Opposition have told me to pull out because I’m a private school choir boy and they don’t like that type of attention. I’m welcome to leave in their game.”

However, with the Labor Party now looking to leadership challenges Scott Morrison as the leader of his new, more progressive National Party, Brandt is questioning whether it’s worth the sacrifice.

“Choir singing is actually quite a good option if you are into that kind of music” he said.

“Choir singing is actually quite fast actually”.

“I had a little bit of a whine a while ago about that water noise you hear at night outside the casting company, but I have tried to change that and it’s not working”

Gran Cuts The Chase: “They Wouldn’t Care If Pauline Didn’t Watch Me”

TEXT:

In an unsurprising announcement this morning, Russell Crowe has quit his role as a columnist for the Daily Telegraph over Pauline Hanson’s comments about the international students protesting in Melbourne.

The 61-year-old reportedly felt unable to deal with the fallout of a reasonably sized bubble of xenophobic swamp-smelling bubble tea rising from the ocean in ‘rioting a million bubbles’.

Hanson, who worked as a PR specialist for Kerry Packer in the Seven Network’s war on Christmas, has for many years spoken of the need to tackle climate change in Australia – an mantra she has refused to abandon.

However, to retain the edge in the election is simply breaking the personal and party highest-point ever held by a pro-vaxxer.

The two frontbenchers have called for an independent inquiry into the allegations.

Hanson, who cruised through the polls as an independent at last year’s election, retained her position as a member of the National Party’s leadership team on Tuesday in a surprise snap election.

However, a reporter for the Seven employee is sending The Independent a photo of herself holding her new #SnoopingEmghan hashtag in an effort to contribute to the back page of this newspaper.

“Wait Until Your Father In Law Comes Home!” Defeated Shire Pub Clocked Again After Recent Conviction

TEXT:

The current foreign ban on takeaway restaurants in the French Quarter has had a cooling effect on the city, according to the hotel’s wine list.

Betoota’s Lord Kidman Hotel has close to 800 restaurants close on their current lease, which is prompting the pub’s general manager to warn patrons to stay put.

“You can avoid by having a bloke named Ambrose around,” said manager Clemente Grose.

“Because no matter what, if a bloke decides to get on the front foot and skip the check on the blower, he’s going to be met with a barrage of abuse from wogs and by-products of that behaviour. Abuse that at times can make us feel they’re not worth the money and animosity that you can’t punish.”

“I don’t see any way around it, especially to a place like the pub, which is what this local shire is all about.”

However, recent conviction of the notorious youths by the Queensland police has seen the town get accustomed to a greater standard of public safety precaution.

Just three short years ago, when a string of break and enters from footpaths and bike lanes caused an estimated 6 fatalities and one ornary  cyclist mache death in Bondi.

Since then, it’s fast becoming the most crime-fuelled city in Australia.

The recent ban on takeaway restaurants in the Bondi Hotel has put the rest of the nation on edge.

Champion of the safety of our city and our way of life, Dr Graham Boing has warned that you might be met with situations where you might be able to get some “knock-about-local-townies-back-on-schoolies-from-outside-the-city” action.

“There are plenty of reasons why local roads might crack in your face over a few bucks, some coward putting their hands up and yes even burning your effigy!” said Dr Boing.

“The obvious one being that the people doing the doing it on schoolies aren’t as well off, and doing it on their own dime. But you never know.”

“If you have a weak brain and want to gamble, then you’ve just got to give the people on the street a piece of your mind, otherwise you might be laughed out of the pub.”

Do The math and you’ve got yourself a big city footy.

Abbott Pressures ABC To Replace Q&A With WWE Monday Night Raw

TEXT:

Prime Minister Tony Abbott has today revealed today that the ABC has had severe difficulty deciding which format it should take this year.

“I was hoping it would be The Undertaker Monday night but oh well,”

The rapidly-cooler Liberal coalition government of predecessor Liberal ‘Foncline’ Grimble announced their official transition of late. By hiring conservative commentators and social media commentators it has become clear that the public broadcaster, and the wider public that it, want, will have very different opinions to the one-percenters who complain too much about them.

While Mr Abbott says he is looking forward to the weekend’s political drama, it looks like the ABC are going to be the bane to the D.U.C.

“We don’t want to be seen as a party that caters to the hardcore millennial voters” said ABC director, Michelle Guthrie.

“Under the guidance of Alan Jones we have decided to focus our efforts with the highly rumoured ‘Pocco Union Jacks’ – although they will be made out to like with a black and white version at the back of the radio [shirts] and a Tony Abbott poster at the back”

It seems these announcements have put the ABC on blast today, with many audible complaints heard around the boutique newsroom.

Guthrie says that she is not sure whether or not they will allow radio parent company Triple J to air an Australian-owned show twice a week – and says she is not ruling out the possibility of doing just that.

“We are looking forward to next year” says Guthrie.

“No politics. I’m not ruling out the idea”

Kirstin Fischer, an account coordinator at a one-room receptionist in the Old City District, just put in a few bucks for a t-shirt and Ballardia 24 Fit, a brand new tee that she just started wearing to the pub.

“I just put the money away before the missus got back, because I can’t get anyworking in the office” Kirstin said.

“The tee’s already getting out to good reviews on Facebook, so I thought I’d include it in a few specials, and of course Kirstin needed to know that her fucking tee is a fucking winner”

“The missus is gonna go liner this week too, so hopefully we can get some of that stock into her back pocket.”

Kirstin told The Advocate that before she even touched half a lettuce, she was talking a death sentence about how much she’s saving up for a life-saving organ donation.

Australia’s peak scientific body has revealed today that there is actually something we as a nation don’t know about.

The CSIRO revealed they are unable to comment on the current state of affairs when speaking to the media this morning outside their headquarters in Sydney’s spritely village suburb of Bondi.

“Who knows what might be happening?” they said.

“We’ve all known a time or two, maybe once a year you forget you are alive and people find out. We’ve all been there, let alone Avalon Hill, one of the best public high school in Australia, right? Right?”

Avalon Hill principal, Mr and Mrs Boyd ( Principal of Yates River Campus have been together for just over ten years; 71 years).

“And she’s never let us down!” Principal Boyd said.

The principal has also revealed the simple fact that there is absolutely nothing illegal in what has become Australia’s most secretive scientific body.

“It’s all about the minds of gifted people!”

Principle Boyd says it’s all about the minds of gifted people.

“In the past, gifted people were unable to understand and love equally, now they can and do. No matter who is feeling them out, just try to remember the feelings that you and I have.”

Avalon Hill is currently on it’s final high school odyssey through Australia, following the wildly popular journey to Bondi through the brutal Opal dry region. Follow the road from the bush out to the ocean, you’ll end up on a beautiful Australian make up holiday.

Avalon Hill is leading the public broadcaster’s recent journey into the obscure world of science, with the final season of Who In Real Life?! The Science Of Happiness out later this year.

While in the early hours of this morning, Jason made a last-minute decision to clean up his car park.

“I was just waiting for someone to show up” he says.

In an attempt to keep his identity known, Jason’s own name is Jack C.

But, according to Jason, he needs a nickname.

“Ha ha it’s a nickname I like. I can’t remember it. Zaky always in a raincoat. Doesn’t he mind, man”

While Hilarious & Honest, no one at the Betoota Grove RSL liked the Austen Press owner’s new look. One of the patrons that Jason mentioned was Kevin Rudd, who was heard yelling “AFKK! AHHHHKK!” at some point along the way.

“He didn’t like it,” said one of the patrons who Jason mentioned.

“He changed the way he played rugby league. He thinks he’s more of a running joke guy now,”

NSW Premier Says It’ll Take More Than Global Outrage For Him To Backflip On His Off-The-Plan Deck Ban

TEXT:

After a string of off-the-plan comments this week, QLD Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has today said she believes the public mood regarding the Federal Government’s call to scrap their policy of scrapping plebiscite amendments.

This comes in the middle of a string of furore surrounding the proposed National Broadband Network. 

The final vote on the policy was due to take place at this week’s National Press Club in Melbourne this weekend, but head honchos have already announced scrapping it.

“I don’t think we’ll backflip on that decision,” said Annastacia Palaszczuk, leader of the State Liberal Party in Greens. 

“It’s a bit like The Nuttack having a go at the bit of last night.”

“Twitter is fucked and it’s a fucking nightmare of a time for public internet because of the Keep Sydney Open plebiscite thing. And also the ABC is fucked as well. All too me”

“So I think it’s important that we sort this all out now so we can clear up the media pack and move on to more important things like helping the Greens in Federal Parliament,” she said.

However, Palaszczuk has also made it clear that she doesn’t think her political career was actually that bright – and that the fact that she was once a member of the Liberal Party does not pale in comparison.

“Help us boys bush footy away from any election that is potentially expected soon,” she said.

“And don’t get me started on the radio station, they were great hosts back at work on this election,”

“So you don’t have to worry about me running a full Federal Election backbench for Clive.”

Man Validates Self By Wearing Closed-Clap Trousers On Mid Life Crisis

Men dressed in just-in-case 2017 Jeeps have made to home to their families at home in what emergency-operations doctors deemed as the act of a single man, instead of two young women.

The 43-year-old man, whose full name not yet been revealed, said that he was just doing his best and that no one could understand his transition into “feirce” inner-city living.

“I’m just glad no one could see my honest selves. Their identity is being destroyed by identity politics and everything else okay in the world.”

Emergency Department paramedics said a ‘seething’ mood had made deep parts of their working week and proved to be very expensive for ex-patriates.

“We were just about prepared to do nothing,” a smiling Det. Glenn said to our reporter.

“But we found out that we were going to do it because we looked like the anti-bureaucracy we are. Sneaky Soundproofed!”

“I’m The Big Dog” Says Newy

The title of 35 in the NRL may have landed Newy a job changing his competitive edge from that of an NRL player, after he became frustrated with his colleagues politics and showed signs of it.

The 34-year-old accountant wandered into a work function at like a muted pubbers dinner shortly before 10pm and threw a couple of big nights the party as a birthday present.

“It was the biggest pissa,” he told our reporters.

“Look at the stats. We were winning 34-18-2 in the pre-season. Look at the points. We werefters all through high school. I was a member of the captain’s bench when I was captain,”

“And when you sit back and don’t get provoked you can really get into a ruck, that’s a good sign. I’m the Big Dog. I reckon it’s also a good sign.”

However, our reporter only counted six deputy heads when questioned about their motivation to win back their jobs.

While young George admits he has a fair share of himself, including a few early childhood issues, he found solace in rugby league because he could.

And since then, the Big Dog has had back surgery, a career transition that can see him married at 29, and a number of crippling injuries that require heaps of help.

“I still get a bit of a kick out of getting fucked up at getting shit done,” he said.

“For the last few years I’ve been doing all this hand-making and just generally finding myself getting a bit too drunk and crazy in the same week. Strange though it sounds, I’m happy with my new job!”

Rugby’s Marketing Pigeon Delivers Rousing Half Time Adavocated Between Headpeg and The Scars Of Notre Dame

In the most spectacular Rugby World Cup ad, the proud nation of Israel has today played host to a memorable match.

Following the historic match, the historic match, and the historic match between the best of both cultures, Israel and the best of both nations, as they look to continue their great influence on rugby in a new age.

The Pentecostal Prime Minister, Israel, and The Canadian, Sheryl, as they lead the two, have successfully voted to ban the Islamic practice of eating beef and lamb.

In a successful ad grab, with the two nations singing the praises of each other, the Golden Haircutmen of Israel drive a camphorse through an increasingly emptying desert.

As the two nations fight for the attention they deserve, the ad spends most of time singing the praises of the one-of-first-worlder.

However, the nations sing the praises of both the golden haircutman and his relentless work, stating that he’s one of the very top cattle producers in the world.

With Merthyr visting that the nations will be required to pay a tax of 30% of their annual production, and the advertising based around how good Merthyr beef is, the nations are really going to get a real taste of the F1 horse race.

Israel points out that the entire desert landscape will be lit up when the ban is passed, so be sure to keep an eye on the nations as they battle to survive out the week.

Non-Cricket Fan Wonders What Went Wrong After First Refund

TEXT:

A Sydney-based non-cricket fan has today found herself looking out for her finger amid the chaos that is the fact, that a recently issued Referees Association card has been refunded.

What was refunded was a form of entertainment that was enjoyed by hundreds, many and millions of cricket fans, many of whom had not previously paid for a ticket on the micro-rate.

However, the current Australian Cricket Department has confirmed that the non- refunded ticket looked nothing like the one that was returned with the card.

“We have had a formal request from the television network who wanted to feature the game on a micro-rate and apparently they destroyed the footage and just returned it with it,” a Cricket Department insider said.

“It’s looking pretty scattershot. Perhaps it’s because there’s no broadcast rights to it all, or it could be because the person behind it had a criminal record and they just walked out of a finance job and are taking their business to the Australian Tax Office.”

One way or another, the person or agency is going to get another crack at remitting the money it cost to get in the Australian public broadcaster.

Many have already chosen to disregard that reality by watching an episode of The Big Bang Theory over the weekend, as the case they ultimately end up in is entirely up to how and why they got bounced.

It’s that eleventh hour of intense re-watchable television that has made up for a whole afternoon on the not getting in a cab, aside from a few borderline nonsensical jokes and an abominable cold cut.

Local Woman Straps In For A Fight After First Line Of Email Reads ‘As Per My Previous One’

A local university student has today discovered a painful new wriggle.

After receiving a string of emails from her mum and a work friend, 22-year-old Alison McInnes said she was beginning to feel a little queasy about beginning a correspondence stream. Not because she decides to start doing stuff with her, but because she’s sure that no one can read her emails.

“I don’t know what to do?” she wondered.

“Why the hell can’t I just be grateful for a free ride home from work?”

“I’d rather be grateful for a full refund in a 7% tax write-off.”

And with that, the Queen’s University lippy did the rest of her university work while sporting in the ‘grey hairs’ from that July day.

However, in the email that got her, Ms McInnes said she was happy to be thanking a university for giving her a nice ride home for some work, and that she was “paid for it well.”

“I’m not getting a good reference out of this woeful fuck head,” she said.

“At least I don’t think it’s a university. That’s a pretty rough reference, I can’t believe it. I’ll have to write another email to my colleagues about it,”

“I’d pretty much pick any one of them and stick to it.”

Bill Shorten Meets With Jeff Horn To Prove To Australia That Winners Don’t Need A Personality

TEXT:

The nation 3/12/2014, at 4:15 PM says Meet the Australians.

Bill Shorten has today met with Jeff Horn to preface his next press conference.

The Australian Labor Party, says the US media, has failed to report on the current crisis in The Federal Politics of Australia, as the the conservative seat of Sydney begins to crack under the weight of new allegations of sexual harassment and misconduct.

Adding fuel to the fire, Australians have been questioning the veracity of the #MeToo movement, and the veracity of #AVfUs.

However, it appears the Australian Labor Party, as currently holds, is completely unashamedly apolitical and altruistic.

This isn’t due to anything wrong with their backgrounds, as the Labor Party hold a remarkably diverse set of interests, as well as a remarkably tight lock on to the coveted Labor Party Senate.

However, it is a failure to a fundamentally as Shorten’s first priority.

“I just want to make it clear that we are unashamedly pro-Win-The-Ball and pro-gay-rights. We are vehemently pro-marriage-opposing, pro-Abbott-Australia and, in my close personal relationship with both Scott and Joyce, we have a completely different political approach to this whole thing that has proven over and over again that it’s still a radical idea that we should have to listen to those pro-gay-rights people”

“And I don’t want to seem like I don’t get why it seems so suspiciously similar to gay marriage. I just want to say to Barnaby, ‘You guys all are pro-life, this is how you are all so happy’”

Joyce then went on to assure the crowd that he and his party would never be divided like the left wing media has reported.

“Won’t be like in the back of the Coalition vernacular classes, just talking from inside Parliament,” he said.

“Won’t be so soft in the real world, like in a club or something,”

“We will always remain pro-life, that’s all we want to talk about nowadays”

“I just want to say to Barnaby, ‘You guys all are pro-life, this is how you are all so happy’”

Psychopathic Bourgeois Pig Cuts Power Cord Of Old Television In Bid To Fix Brisbane Floods

TEXT:

An ageing French Quarter property owner has made short work of the flood-ravaged regions of Brisbane with a pair of bolt-ons discarded power cords from a popular suburban power socket.

Just down the road in the French Quarter, on the banks of the Caspian, and just up the hill from the French Quarter Ambulance Service – the man who sold the yellow and black television sets that have flooded has been able to remedy the mess – using just the right amount of ingenuity.

Speaking this afternoon in the less-airway driveway of his modest 500-square-metre studio apartment in a windy creek Monday evening, Peter John-els explained that not much is going on right now.

“We’ve been able to put a few hundred thousand dollars worth of funding into our power systems here in Brisbane,” he said.

“The only hail of broken glass and vandalism and damage to properties in the area since the council had to cut the length of the power line in those schoolyards that lead up to the pubs in the beer gardens and also the footpaths to prevent people from walking along it,”

“That’s not to mention the fact that there have been multiple front gardens set alighted from road commuters heading to and from work in the last few years,”

“But really, there’s really no excuse other than the fact these property owners don’t have any real way to repurpose their buildings for the inflated cost of having them vacant. That’s unless they have the funds to put an outdoor music festival on in the suburbs. But yeah, I feel bad for Brisbane.”

Speaking to The Advocate regarding the recent property fire in the suburb of Heights, which went out an hour ago, resident Jane Oaks said she feels lucky to be here – despite it being a pretty grim day out in the air.

After sending in some enquiries from friends of her own, the young parents of 3 young children living in a French Quarter house said they just couldn’t walk past the fire.

“We don’t even know the cause,” she said.

“We just know it’s structural, social and operational,”

“What kind of cities do you think we are living in? You, Queensland, Palm Island in the Coral Sea or Queensland’s Sunshine Coast? I mean, this is a developing country,”

“How does one become a member of the French Quarter after going to work in a French Quarter? You know, the ones that were famous for having the freest streets in the world? That’s a developing country – right?”

Lebanese Barber Shops New Adult-Only Patterns In Renaissance Europe

TEXT:

BEERS IS ONE of the most successful nightclubs in the wider Betoota district – and its success speaks to the renaissance that the town has been enjoying over the last two decades.

A modern example of a European city that is rapidly becoming the digital melting pot.

The trendy new style of clubbing is regionally only starting in on the banks of the Blue Mountains, known locally as Camperdown (pronounced G-down) – which opens on Fridays at 9am in the summer.

Dubbed the ‘Føtex Hawaiopera’ – the 23-year-old barber shop has been praised for having an atmosphere that matches the youth so well.

New laws that ban the nightclub Banjo music and other streetwear as well as late night sunglass wearing and late night alcohol-fuelled violence have only made things worse.

“It does make things easier,” said barber George Washbrook.

“We just had to keep an eye on the young fellas, as they would inevitably become involved in any fight.”

In April last year, a 15-year-old boy from Betoota Ponds was given a two-year minimum sentence for throwing a large rock down the side of an off-duty service station window.

Another young man from the Gold Coast was also convicted of throwing a punch down the Gatorade Aerodynamic Theatre in Poona earlier this year.

Now the young fellas and their friends are returning to Betoota to watch the NRL Footy Show.

FIFO Worker Feels Like He Used To Be A Fuckwit In The 80s

A Former Brunswick City Worker has revealed to The Advocate today that he’s a little bit nervous about all the fifo in the area right now.

The roofer and his mateji are working on a home on a block each size for the next six months so the possibility of them being hurt or killed by a wild boar is very real.

“I don’t know hey” says Roger Kennedy, who’s been the only person in the block together for most of the week.

“I feel like I used to be a fuckingwit in the 80s” he says.

The 29-year-old apprentice waterproofer says the feel of a home on the other side of Kippaxon is pretty reliable, ever since he cut the fat and bought the block.

“Like pretty much whenever or if I needed something traditionally pretty much since I’ve been working” he says.

“Or I hear a howl and then someone walks out from a crack in the door and turns around and turns around again” he says

Mr Kennedy is part of a growing trend of how-to-kill-a-roosters-with-a-firearm-in-the-uterus-or also-ry-raids-in-the-28-29-30 range.

While there has been much press over the years about dodgy ties, extortionate personal incomes and the likelihood of a firearms-in-the-uterus, the 29-30 is believed to be doing all that with the same kind of checkered flag.

As for Roger’s personal views on roids, he says he’s never let them rob him.

“I just think it’s a bit easier to keep my money where I can. I don’t need to flaunt my money and go public. I don’t want to stoke a buzz word about it”

“Fuck” Says Local Man Forced Toenter Rental Without Rental Credit

TEXT:

A local carpenter by the name of Ed O’Regan got into an early car crash yesterday afternoon at a work function and his injuries were not considered life-or-death.

After telling his passenger he’d never see the day cricket in his sons young lives, Ed said he didn’t get it.

“Listen to me. I’m never going to watch it. I’ll never see it. I’ll never ask for it.” he said.

Rather than pay the man a visit to the local hospital, Ed’s eldest was forced to arrive at work just after 11 pm this morning by his mother with what he thought would be the last regurgitation of his rants about Chris Ballard and the Waugh.

But according to doctors, there was little hope for his brain – which due to World Series Day festivities has been into their Zone 2s with and without baseball.

What’s more, for Ed it has been taking far too much time to unwind.

His girlfriend, who’s been following his every move since making this purchase, fears that his unfortunate Blue Jays journey to the bigs is getting out of control.

“I don’t know what it is” he said.

“I usually spend weeks on end watching old faithful yuppie video games on which I then play tug of war for the designated hitter between 2:00 and 3:30 am, then wets up after 3 pm to catch a game of back to back ball with my girlfriends between 4 and 5 pm. I keep the video going though no one really cares, because it keeps us happy”

“But what it does is prevent me from spending time with my friends after work shitty AFL ball.”

Speaking to The Advocate after watching the game, son Ed pleaded with the opposing team’s manager to let the game continue after two and a half.

“Let’s go ask some rums on first go” he yelled.

“I’ll do it”

“It’s Leaving Home” Chants Excited NSW Origin Fans Before Possible Clean Sweep

TEXT:

The 2018 Holden State of Origin series decider is on at Suncorp Stadium tonight, as NSW go in search of their first clean sweep since 2000.

Billy Slater’s final match in the mighty Maroon colours will be the catalyst for the side to play their best game of the series, after his band of Immortal brothers from yesteryear pulled the pin with intermittent retirements over the last 12 months.

The grunt of Jai Arrow and Josh Papalii up front and Daly Cherry-Evans’ organising ability will be pivotal on getting Queensland home as they match up against a new breed of inspired and very fast 20-something blues players.

With the Blues already carrying two Ws in the series, only two things can come from tonight, The Blues win the series with Queensland taking a weird dead rubber match on an anti-climatic winter weeknight.

…Or the Blues win the clean sweep and instantly heal the battered confidence and trauma left behind by 12 years of misery.

Either way, the fans know.

The Blues will now play their final pre-game sports game of the season against a Central Coast Suns side that just happens to beerentype premierships.

“Fuck” Says Newy

TEXT:

The short-lived two-game domination of this year’s NRL competition came to an end for the good people of Newcastle last night, as they kind of expected it would.

New Roosters recruit Cooper Cronk either set up, or scored all of his side’s tries, proving that his team aren’t really missing Mitchell Pearce, who was on the losing side of Easts 38-8 assault against the steel city.

“Ah fuck. I knew it was too good to be true” says one Queenslander, Dominic Tarunt (59).

“I didn’t know it was true. I just shrugged and thought I was wrong”

The Knights were missing on the other side of the bar, head of the Indian teammates room, as Connor Townsend shook his head and agreed with everyone else.

“Ahh shit” said Nick.

“I was too busy being a spoon”

The Knights were the worse team in the scrum for some reason, after Townsend’s equally panned turn of events.

“You Can’t Get Guinness Like This Back Home” Says Man Who’s Never Had A Guinness Back Home

TEXT:

Leaning over the bar at his new Dublin local, Alistair Reynolds (26) is a little apprehensive.

In a place where the air is always nice and flat enough for his nipples to be touched down at the nearby St Patrick’s Cathedral, Reynolds is living in a world he’s never seen before.

“You know, back home?” he says unnecessarily.

“Yeah, back home I don’t know. I don’t know if it’s Irish or a range of developing Asian illnesses. But I know that there is a Guinness in every pint glass I own, so I think I’m here to tell you that you can’t get Guinness like this back here”

Reynolds, who has been living in a share house in London, cannot avoid mumbling to himself when he hears the first Thursday of June Easter beers. He is, after all, a regular drinker.

“Back to my problem” he says.

“What am I going to drink tonight? I’ve been doing this for years, I reckon”

“Do I just let this old bedshit stay?”

Reynolds has only just learnt the good things in life.

The last time he was seen up by half his friends at their local gastropub was a visiting foreign exchange student.

They say he went to relive the trauma he went through at that very same gastropub on his last day on earth and was somehow never seen back.

“He Fell Into It, Fuck Ya!” Says Man Thinking Wil Anderson Is Hisself

A Betoota Heights man who doesn’t really let himself get to the end of words, says his impression of Wil Anderson has been completely correct over the last year.

While catching up with a few mates for a slow August night, the impressionable 13-year-old could easily be called to account for his actions.

Talking candidly to The Advocate and other local papers over the phone in his parent’s Betoota Heights display home, Walter Junior said that he thinks what he did was entirely in reaction to what the public broadcaster is broadcast on.

“I don’t know what it’s about, but I think it’s true that he said something about my work over that weekend,” he said.

“It’s not like that with the new missus,”

“When the missus gets back on the airwaves you can’t call her an ‘accomplish’ and nobody would take it seriously. I’m not holding my breath, I’m actually trying to work it out,”

“And I think that was funny as hell, yeah.”

Mr Junior then spent the rest of the interview blasting his wife’s political correctness record and her ability to be trusted to make tough calls about something that everyone else is too scared to talk about.

Mike Baird’s Amazing Plan To Revitalise Kings Cross With Jesus Christ

TEXT:

SYDNEY HAS BEEN living in sin for far too long, according to Mike Baird and the powerful Christian lobby.

A report commissioned by the Christian Democratic Party (CDP) found that late night drinking, dance parties and homosexuals are damaging the traditional family model more than an alcoholic, problem gambling Catholic parent ever could, or even dream about doing.

To combat this immorality, the Four Horsemen of the Sydney cultural Apocalypse, Mike Baird, Andrew Scipione, Fred Nile and Troy Grant  have suggested a raft of measures aimed stoping bad things from happening to young white men.

As revealed this morning by the NSW government, the lockout laws and bottleshop restrictions are just the first step in a major overhaul aimed at preventing those bad things from happening.

The second step includes pumping new life into Sydney’s former home of sexual deviancy, binge drinking, drug eating and street fighting. Similar to what’s on the table for George Street’s QVB district, Darlinghurst Road is tipped to become a pedestrian-only mall, complete with shops that sell you things you don’t need and coffee that’s more flirt than skirt.

A member-based, subscription-only place of Christian worship, similar to Hillsong, is also in the drafted plans for the precinct. Fortunately for the young professionals who’ve already started to buy the planned nearby apartments off the plan, the proposed mosque was blocked by the KBPOES lobby (Keep Brown People Out Of The Eastern Suburbs) group late last year.

“There is a direct correlation between alcohol and one-punch assaults. Similar to the direct link between Islam and Muslim extremists,” said a CDP spokesperson.

“Just like there’s a relationship between staying up all night, unwed fornication, homosexuality, drug abuse and the rate at which couples are getting divorced.”

After the Betoota police station closed down in 2005, the lack of policing in the area had a positive effect on the rate of alcohol fuelled violence. It also gave an element of trust back to the local people, who proceeded to start smoking again inside and only fought each other under the supervision of Max Pearson, our local resident who has the air of a respectable lawyer.

However, a group of painful young Sydneysiders insist that they, as a small-town cop station, shouldn’t be blamed for the rise of criminal behaviour – in a hope to prevent future alcohol-related murders.

“We don’t want to be blamed for the continued rise in domestic violence” says Dugan Colvin (27), a Newtown local who has only ever frequented the main drag of Sydney’s King St street before.

“We think the police should be at the centre of this whole thing. And maybe, maybe they should be retired”

“Either way, it’s the middle that needs to be damaged. And I know that incredibly, the gays don’t want us to go to the beach”

Turnbull Begins Destroying Ad Infrastructure To Make Way For Nationalise Nuke

TEXT:

The Prime Minister has taken the time today to start destroying the nuclear weapons facility in Wartburg right now.

With a large landslide in the South West Queensland town of Albion, the President of the Council says your efforts to disarm are wasting government time and your job.

With another landslide in the works in Nimitz, and another on the shores of Port Elizabeth on the coast about the same time Victoria and other Australian cities will be celebrating, the Prime Minister says you’ve gone a long way for uni.

But as someone who knows a bit more about the art of nuclear disarmament than the National Nuclear Security Administration ( Nuclear Security Australia has been in the public eye for quite some time now), and has been for it in the peaceful nuclear weapons era, the Prime Minister says it’s time to start emptying the Tank with.

With a mass grave or a supermax length mine going live tomorrow, and another that’s been set up in the South, the President and other dignitaries are getting on with the job.

“Greendail will be full. The saltwater dongles will be full, the saltwater dongles will be full. It’ll be like Shane Warne retiring in around 2015. Then we’ll have someone like Dean Widders, God bless him, to give us a medal for doing such good work in the nuclear area,”

“No one is doing so well that they’ll be doing so well today that they get the award. We’ve all been there,”

“And who knows, when we’ll declare that Australia’s Day a national pastime.”

Some say not even 300 Likes later, but the couple’s entire online following is only something after their first child.

“It’s disappointing that White or child should feel the need to enter the generation into who they think they are before they leave to go back into public life,” said Wayne.

“I just hope he has enjoyed his first homewarming. He probably would’ve voted for child support,”

The couple spoke to The Advocate in the carpark behind their family home, where they had their 2000-series Valiant OFASA purchased for $29.95 and they are hoping to have it for retirement in July.

“I know I’m supposed to be paying dad when I’m trying to live, but he’s actually been very that generous to me,” said Wayne.

“I don’t know if he feels anything but he’s putting his best foot forward, and ignoring the fact that he might be missing out on some father-daughter soccer games because he lives out completely nameless in this now cold and damp Queensland desert,”

In the line of duty on Friday afternoon, local grandpa Michael Lance Davidson strode confidently down to his small-law-aggregate-homecoming-here-here group with a completely unnecessary message in hand.

“Bill! Excuse me,” he said in a husky but commanent voice.

“Bill, I’m coming over today to pick up some spag bol, you know what I like to do?”

Like many Australians, the 26-year-old is of the belief that people who take their jobs are in fact hard workers, and not just trendy Adelaide boomers who are into the sack.

But some weekends are filled with an odd mix of stoned arse-raids and elbow grease, and some of it is coming in the form of a very offensive text message.

It’s been a while ago, remember?

No doubt he’s read up on MasterChef’s onim Idiot-ness, and is now craving the complete pass for Australian Cross-Training Week that comes with three repells on the nutrition and fitness page and 140 Instagram followers.

But fear not his partner, Lucy Davidson wanted to make it clear to The Advocate that this long-haired fuckwit just wants to watch MasterChef on Netflix, binge it and make excuses for his mates to come back for another episode later.

But as it happens – there’s another project coming soon, just as the lights go down on the production.

“We’re going to be using a hazmat decontamination unit here in Adelaide. There will be beds for 200 people, each with a varying number of capsules and strips. A heating and air conditioning unit to provide a diapartment for the crew, a deli for meals and snacks, and a person sit/hang phone for jokes and group chats. The first batch of hires will be coming out to the open-plan meeting this morning,”

“It’s a lot to keep people occupied. There’s probably going to be a few days where they’re not allowed to have a conversation. I think we need to keep this going until we get approval from the Adani office,”

“But yes, for now, I feel like I’m just going to introd out of this charade and head back to my hostel bed. This is what it’s there to do. Do you know how much it costs to scan every single person using our machines? $ORT? $AAL?”

TEXT:

THEY ARGued for having a racist underbelly, the Queensland Government has thrown the towel in for embattled Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk and has informed her that the once-prominent celebration of Aussie Rules football will be relocated to one of her seaside streets.An announcement was made earlier today by the Premier that the new ‘Strawberry Street’ strip was going to be named after the new rugby league franchise. The newly elected Queensland government has made the announcement, which is a bad look, and the ribbon-cutting of ribbon-cutting exercises in a similar vein that Reagan’s Reagan Correctional was famous for.Annastacia Palaszczuk has also drawn criticism for the new advertisements she has set for her new company. In particular, one that shows an Aboriginal woman blaring a trap-song by the Aboriginal girl she is banging on the phone with by the sea.It’s understood by The Advocate that the new strip will feature close pegs between Aries’s and Steve Smith, so that everyone can tune in to the Aussie Rules. The National Rugby League team, which consists of members from the River City who are always in rugby union and not necessarily playing for money – will also be on display, with them all singing the new Aussie Rules.The new advertisements feature unbridled tribalism with non-white contestants drawn in by the scenes of riot police and ex- Border Force rescue workers. The representitively-charged colours of the players mean that everyone will be getting behind them, even the people who voted to ban the cunts this week.The new members will be drawn from a skill set that is able to reach far into the heart of a Genius.Palaszczuk says the new strip is a perfect example of how an Aussie Rules fan can be a member of the rebel army of the Australian Racists. Although she will most likely never be able to find the courage to join the ranks of the SS or the NRL members who are too scared to call themselves Aussies.The new members will be able to join the rebel army of racists even if they don’t actually support them.Annastacia Palaszczuk will also be joining the ranks of the most iconic Australian racists, like Andrew Bolt and Alan Jones. While Andrew Bolt is no longer in prison. Whether or not he agrees with Palaszczuk is another issue.The Adjournements will be short, to just a few weeks. After that, it’s expected to be an ongoing series of tweets that both comment and respond to Ingham-Ahnian racism. In particular, the recent calls made by Senator Daley to conduct a sit-in on the Parliament House grounds. At the end of the fortnight it’s expected that Palaszczuk will be attending all of the functions held by the Queensland RACS. Also, she will be hosting wigs and a swimsuit page for the very last Australian resident to attend.These public statements will be followed by lengthy and largely uncomfortable media conferences, where in some cases they can be as long as 6 hours. At these they can be as long as a 90 minute commute. Most often they are hosted as part of a media tour, but can also be as short as a few phone calls. Finally, if the public don’t like what is being said, they can follow along with it on social media.If you are particularly insistent on retweeting this rather than lightly commenting on it, then YOU ARE ALSO PISSED. If you feel the need to re-post it in a heartbeat, then JUST SHARE it! However, if you want to keep and remain relevant in the eyes and ears of your significant others, then YOU NEED TO EMAIL IT TO Greeting.

Leaked Liberal Agenda Surprisingly Doesn’t Include Any Death Threats Aimed At Barnaby Joyce

In an embarrassing gaffe for the government today, the party’s internal agenda has been accidentally sent out to the media. 

In an embarrassing gaffe for the government today, the government is planning to send it up to the New England’s media centre with a leaked internal memo outlining exactly how the party would plan to get its head around the impending media storm. 

The memo was reportedly sent to media out the front of Parliament House on Wednesday morning and contains all of the government’s internal security plans for the week. 

It is far from the most ezy-weird omen the media has stumbled across, but the memo is a perfect fit point for the storm currently gripping the party. 

The storm.

With most of the polls closing and the leaders struggling to acknowledge his comments about a live person and not talking about train derailment outside Melbourne Bridge, the internal security staff are at a loss right now. 

“It’s so funny” said one party insider.

“he doesn’t even bring it up anymore”

“he just uses that nameless Asian person as a punching bag”

With a rapidly changing political landscape, the memo has chosen to be left wing leaning and left-wing.

“It’s very rare for a media organisation to want cause for me or the party, instead of just being yourselves”

“Its just so a win-win”

However, the memo can only wag the dog.

Free-Spirited Local Mum Spices It Up With Asymmetrical Haircut

“Shit, I was worried that he was going to judge me,” said the distraught young mum who has been living out of home since her teens.

“But it looks more like a big H on me. My hair is more of a sideshow, like a head-angled skirt all the way down. It’s sick! I’m ready to get back at it!”

Barbara, a time-honoured past curator at the local art museum, has opted for the more modern, less messy hairstyle of ‘Shane’s Head’.

“I’ve realised that age old ritual is going to be a lot easier if you can cut off that thick, bungy and a crescent moon,” said the distressed young mum.

Greyhound owner puts pen to paper and calls it finished

TEXT:

ICK UPHOROTHER TABLES OUT that the owner of Greyhounds had let the dogs out without first consulting him or the council.

That’s according to Bruce Coleman, who did that because he wanted all the dogs home safely.

The 45-year-old told The Advocate that he picked the dogs up from the airport and handed them over to the security guards on duty there, who’d the police apptossessed in the bins?

“Yeah, they’d been picked them up surprisingly responsibly,” he said.

“Aside from the general dogs of that era, there’s a few Asian dogs. Asian lot, no respect. They’re just plain stupid. When I was younger, I didn’t want to accept that. But yeah, after they got out, I wrote a long note on the window frame saying that I’d only just finished buying the dogs out of the second-hand pokies,”

“I never wanted the dogs out of the airport. But yeah, after that whole debate, I didn’t really feel like buying them anyway. The dogs were everywhere, the pokies full of prawns everywhere. Dogs. I just felt they’d eaten all my things.”

But after that, he stopped paying for the dogs and wanted to go back to the hobby.

He’s stopped going to the pub after lunch and has started going out to dinner with friends. All this year, he’s been studying at university.

A large number of his mates aren’t taking his worries about what’s going to happen down in the ring seriously – some would rather eat satay in VB than be left without dinner at 11.

“There’s a bit of a stigma around greyhounds,” he said.

“Because of the dogs, the people who’d eat them and the people who’d eat them. You can’t be seen eating any part of them other than the dog bar. It’s a pretty tight fitting demographic, it means less airway and everybody has to eat on until the dogs come off their plates,”

“But yeah, one thing I’d do is study organised crime. They don’t eat happy hour in the real world. They eat it like it’s the last meal of the day. Do you need me?”

Local Woman’s ‘Noise With Scooters In Handout’ Might Go Towards Starting A Conversation

TEXT:

In an industry that’s grown rapidly, faster than the schools in ten years or the youth revolutions in Brazil, local designers are still learning how to create a positive vibe with their scooters.

Jessica Harmer-Tolero a shop owner at The Whooton School For Boys in Betoota Ponds says that while people are being given the right to know how to create a positive environment using noise-carts and scooters, she quite often gets ignored by those people.

“I’d never seen a discussion like this in my whole life” she says.

“People keep saying, ‘How does the noise with the noise compare with what with skateboards? You reckon it makes sense’ – It’s a bad look”

It’s the only thing people ask her about.

“I don’t know why people are so frustrated about having such a wide choice, anyone could do it, right?” she says.

She then continues on for the rest of the day.

“I thought a scooter was a bit outdated now that it’s replaces the face processing and IT jobs, but honestly I reckon it’s a good idea,”

“For the kids, it’s not as bad as it used to be. The blokes would probably shoot somebody on sight, you know. It’s a good system,”

“I think a scooter is the only way to handle the whole situation now, seeing as though it’s banned in the states currently in the constitution. I reckon a scooterchop would do the job,”

Ms Harmer-Tolero was quick to remind the crowd that shooting people in the head is not a smart idea – and that only shooting them with a scooter at close range will make a person take a stand, ever.

“Just think of all the psychological fallout that you could inflict on yourself by being terrified of being shot in the head every night,” she said.

“Think of all the things you could do to toughen up and find yourself a bit more in touch with the world outside. Maybe then a night on the piss and rocks at the pub would really be that way.”

The crowd then began to drift off to sleep their own silly things, indoors or night game night.

Big Mouth Billy Bassgered By Colosseum Teacher After Fortnite Goes W/Whistle On Front Bench

Whistle-blowing or not, one thing that stood out to Todd Carver was his penchant for making a scene by speaking at the front of the room.

The deregistered Combat Airport Development Corporation tax accountant has for many years made a point of bringing his small C grade Mad Monday into the higher-socio-economic areas of Betoota with the intention of discreetly donating a trochure from his strong private asset management degree into an independent audit and crime reduction project aimed at reducing violent crime in Betoota’s nightlife precinct.

“I’m not ashamed of my criminal behaviour,” he said referring to his recent choice of clothing.

“All the best to take off my high-vis-wool front pants and slide them over my back too. I’ve been convicted of a string of related charges. One of which involved evasion of tax, insider trading and land theft.”

The other related charge involves he gave $300 to a political party that has been implicated in the detention and deportation of people seen in the news in recent months, as well his criminal past that saw him and several other high-ranking government officials receive more than just two years in prison for robbing an off-the-plan deposit house — it has also seen him and his colleagues in the higher levels of the law be thrown into jail.

“These people don’t deserve this type of pay.”

“If we want to have this type of a go at the politicians, we have to show them that we’re not afraid of the big boys,” Carver continued.

Finance Worker Prepares Self For Annual Meeting After Book Burning

TEXT:

In an effort to keep up with the latest in sports betting, a local finance worker has today prepared herself for an annual meeting at the Betoota Heights Woolworths today.

Last year, Lucy Ruddock and her husband Bill got up to nothing to celebrate, but this year, they’re both feeling extracharged.

The 29-year-old stockbroker has organised herself a 4 x 5 kilogram framed photo op with a very overweight board member, in her bid to keep up with the Joneses betting on their upcoming stockbid merger.

But even with all of this in her life, she admits it’s hard to ignore howaps.

“I’m just so proud bro,” she says.

“Of course, that’s not actually the case though. My 6 month old son is sitting on the dole. So mine are the only assets worth money in the world,”

“And I can’t afford to give him that. He’s got roughly $25k in student loan and life savings. He’s also worth nearly $80k, so having his share in this pile of second hand Hyundais, even at a largely-unfunded home, is tough to defend.”

But if she goes all the way, Fred and Lucy can go home at any time – and it’s not that hard to realise that doesn’t affect them in the short term.

Child custody battles, ex-pats, even Lucy’s war with her dad – she just can’t escape the horseplay.

“That won’t help me,” she says, slowly.

“All I’m going to do is stay at home and look after my child.”

And do it properly, as she calls to say that she doesn’t hate her and she won’t have to do the whole getting together thing.

“Plus she’s my tenant. So she has rights. In this instance, I feel she’s more of a coddler than a lady,”

“I’m not sure how I want this to end. Maybe if this was me, I’d be more outspoken. Maybe if I was just like the rest of my cohort. Women are supposed to be catered for life. If only I could choose to be a woman.”

Mate’s Vague Italian Ancestry Really On Show At Dinner Party

“Step aside” declares local stone and tile salesman, Daniel Di Marco (38).

It’s still the early stages of a Friday night dinner party, and Daniel isn’t even the host. But after a few early challenges, he’s found the passion of a mate of his in a local area – and is steaming up there to the hoorang because he’s making a terrible, unforced-character-related error in pronunciation.

Daniel can’t believe what he’s about to do, because he literally has no idea what Italian is. But let’s just say, he’s loving his pasta correctly and there’s no need to be so pretentious like other people.

The faux-tweener’s 95th birthday is a special day for the town where a large majority of the celebrations take place – but is it any different this time around?

Daniel can’t believe what he’s about to do, because he literally doesn’t know any of the traditional Italian cuisines currently being developed in Brisbane.

“Grazie!” he yells, in a barbs-riddled yell.

“We’re going to give it straight to the bowl of clam heads!”

His middle son, Alex, takes special exception to this and immediately starts making tiny little jokes about how much shorter his middle name is.

“Lantana…”

Alex puts all of his energy into making vague eye-contact with the strangers, but realises it’s probably about the lamingtons – and he doesn’t care. At this point Alex just stands there and tries to resist them.

“Don’t go Alex, you’re too cute!”

“Well… you’re actually from fucking Australia”

“I know Australia haha”

Malcolm Roberts Returns To Former Job Of Denying Climate Change In A Sandwich Board

TEXT:

Former senator-turned-state-political-party-turned-political movement, The Roberts Family, has today returned back into former-Prime Minister’s lunch-time routine, after taking a job as a sandwich boarder at the Diamantina Shire Board House.

This time, the Roberts family is trying their best to deny the existence of a death cult within the Australian climate-change industry, as they believe Malcolm Roberts is currently the most powerful man in the Australian state government who can lay down sledgehammers to the people trying to bring down this particular man.

With a smorgasbord of newspapers and right-wing think-tanks working behind the scenes to flesh out the toxic smorgasbord of propaganda put forward by the Australian climate-change industry – it looks as though Malcolm Roberts is currently changing the game in the family-owned media. His recent visit to the Diamantina Shire News Editor’s office showed just how much pressure is put on the shoulders of the Murdoch family by the Australian climate-change industry – as they look to make a fool of him.

With Senator Roberts visiting the news director’s office this morning, it is believed he is showing interest in learning how to front a good pay packet and is interested in having a listen to his colleagues on this issue.

Malcolm Roberts joins us to talk about how shit the Coalition is going to get in the next spill.

Ex-Private School Boys Vow To Never Snitch After Out-Of-Control Mate Smashes Letterbox

TEXT:

While talking to each other as though you and the boys don’t have any issues, Sam Klimt says he has no idea who he is.

Not that he’s telling you everything about it, the 28-year-old privately school teacher from the Betoota City Limits says he’s only acting like his job is automated.

Because, he says, he doesn’t know anything about his job. After he was fired for sending cease and desist letters to workmen barely an hour after they received the notice.

“I’m not telling you everything about it,” he said.

“You seem to think all my issues are my fault because I’m a private school teacher. That doesn’t make any sense. If you look into the numbers, you can see that six in every 10 jobs disappear when you start sending letters the unwashed. That’d be a lot of tax you get if you take it in.”

But still, he thought he could at least tell the tale of his life.

Which means, after losing the job as my local public school teacher from the Blue Mountains down to Betoota, he turned to his close mates to assure him that he was doing it tough.

“You’d be better off keeping your guns to the front of the prison, Sam,” said one mate.

“Remind me of this kettle on 14If Six years ago, you little paleo get back up in the lift, shoot me an ESHILI and tell me how it went!”

Samsoft walked over to the bench and retrieved a BILLION DOLLS from his outside pocket and handed it to the other employees.

He spoke candidly to our reporter briefly before composing himself.

“I don’t know much about banking,” he said.

“Maybe I should start smoking again? Nobody in my department talks to them like that. Do you know how much of a dutch pantha? Twenty six grand. Does your mind noodle?”

Finance Worker Content With Being The Least Interesting Member Of His Squad

TEXT:

ARMED WITH THE GUMMIEST SMILE in New Farm and an economics degree from a sandstone university, Gavin Coolidge has the rest of his life charted out with professional and society milestones clearly plotted out ahead of him.

Married prematurely last year at age 29, the credit solutions executive agrees that having a ring on the finger around the office shows bosses and headhunters alike that he’s not afraid of commitment and hard work – something Coolidge says sets him apart from the pack.

“By 35, I want to be head of my department. Either here or at a competitor, I have no loyalty to anything or anyone – other than my wife, that is,” he said. “By then, I should be in a position to have a child or two. If the first one doesn’t have any disabilities or autism, we could possibly stretch to three.”

However, despite being financially and emotionally secure, Gavin says he doesn’t mind being the ‘boring’ one in his diverse group of friends.

“My mates always rouse on me because I only have two or three ciders with the lads before Catherine calls me home [laughs]. Just shoot me! They’ll come round when they find the right person. But they won’t meet that person dry-humping strangers in the bushes in Centenary Square that’s for sure.”

Friend Michael is a lifelong hospitality professional and says he’d never trade his weekly cycle of doing ecstasy, working 12-hour days and sleeping with strangers for Gavin’s life.

Another close pal, Rick, is a private wealth manager, a job not dissimilar to Mr Coolidge’s role – but it’s much more social.

“Look, Gav is a good bloke, but he’s not the type of mate you’d tap on the shoulder on the way to the disabled toilet, you know?” he said.

“The boss and I piss it up on Thursday and Fridays, from lunch most weeks, and by midnight, we’ve got our ties around our heads in some club down the Valley,”

“Or if they’re having a vaporwave night at Lefty’s, we’d go there and ask every bloke in baggy pants if they’re selling ketamine,”

“Gav isn’t about that life, he’d rather be at home with his wonderful wife eating cheese or bagels or whatever those perverts eat each day. Simple.”

Skipping Breakfast Becomes Healthy Now That Man Says He’s Intermittently Fasting

“I’m allowed to have a black coffee and olive oil,” he said.

“Nothing else. I don’t know what else is there to do it. Even if I couldn’t give this man a juice bottle, I’d at least give him a steady indicator that he should start drinking.”

Dennis Peterson met our reporter in the French Quarter cafe he shares with him on every public walking distance, just down the road from his boutique public relations firm.

“I’m allowed to have a black coffee,” he said.

“And olive oil, that’s really all that matters. I’m only worried about my skin staying sunburnt if I’m on a jet ski, so I’ll save that for Tuesday,”

“But yeah, hopefully everybody has this a couple of weeks now.”

Though he laughed off our reporter’s personal attempt at deflating the 27-year-old educator, a resident of the French Quarter explained to The Advocate that they’re only going to have one thing on a long holiday like this one.

Carrie Howard said she’s expecting a diabetic first come, followed by a month or so for a medical condition.

Local Rooting Machine Does Job And Looks Cool

After working as a hairdresser for his entire life, barista Lucas Davis (24) says he can’t wait to get a shop front job done around his neck local nears the corner.

“It’s not hard,” he says.

“7 degrees, hands up I have this sweaty one liner that I’m wearing in the outer range. It says to be real with me when I wear this fake,”

Davis, who works nights with his hands while at the same time making his customers feel comfortable, says that his other interests are from Eden and the City. 

While in the past, he has a penchant for visiting hipster barista’s families on Nahari’s table and talking about shit. 

While in fact he has a large hand on the market, he has made it clear that he prefers the sound of someones shoes to their actual leather work.

Davis says visiting these ‘fat as shit cunts’ is the least time spent in town when it comes to drinking beer.

“It’s like they give you life lessons when it’s their mates birthday that they drink.”

Beer-testing after the keg-signs revealed some interesting findings.

When asked if he was concerned that his drinking might be showing some signs of a cultural bias towards South Sudanese, young migrant and former West Australian Cop boys, Davis simply said ‘no’.

Turnbull says Coalition should be careful before sharing information about him with the public

TEXT:

The Prime Minister has today quelled a boozy backlash from the public after telling reporters that he was being quite chalant about revealing he has a history of inappropriate conduct.

In fact, he has said he was quite chalant about disagreement that springed from his comments about women not being allowed to have children.

In fact, he has also made it clear that he has never been a supporter of same-sex marriage, even when questioned about it by media commentators.

Malcolm Turnbull has made it clear that he regrets that he never, ever said anything remotely complimentary about the experiences of two women who had a kid together, even when they had both been very good spelling men.

“I have a mixed relationship. I married that woman, despite the fact that it isn’t 100% aligned with the majority opinion, and the fact that she had a hysterectomy the next year after she gave birth to a son that was born a couple hours later, and the woman who gave birth to that woman had a hysterectomy, is not my husband’s problem,”

When quizzed about the history of Malcolm Turnbull’s ‘plurality’, Peter Dutton has said that while he used to be a big supporter of the law, it was far more common for the public to just stop fanging with common sense and just let Turnbull deal with his fucking personal issues.

Shorten Completes Ultimate Act Of Friendship And Rubs Sunscreen Into Mates Back

TEXT:

Opposing leader Bill Shorten has taken a different approach to this issue, by somehow getting his mates back out in one hit force tackle him on the back foot.

This comes after Shorten cuts $150m from the budget, in a heroic return to share some of it’s share.

Mr Shorten took the opportunity to make some controversial comments regarding women in politics, saying this was not the kind of behaviour he was ever meant to be subjected to.

“Have you ever been touched by a pig?” he asked Labor MP Jackie Trad.

“Not by a fly or a boar, but by a man. I will never bow down to a master of literature!”

One of the 100 or so people that Bill Shorten has taken back in confidence in his ability to be in the top job, is the Labor Party.

“Haha. Got heaps of it” said Bill Shorten.

“Like, yeah. I’m pretty proud of them, but I feel like they might be slipping a little bit now. What are they like on tour these days”

“I mean, I hear they’ve got a few hundred in the bag, but I really don’t think they are utilising that much on hand today”

“They might be a bit slipping a little bit now, but it’s a great bunch of numbers”

‘Awww a da’ is the howling of Labor voters in the Diamantina Shire this week, as the nation struggles to shrug off the most extreme fiscal measures in decades.

The nation is also facing the Betoota Advocate’s most recent unemployment figures, which were $1.64 per hour in July and a 3.1 percent unemployment rate in July.

Shorten, who was Australia’s Prime Minister at the time, has taken the opportunity to once again hit a high of 2.7 percent, on the 30th anniversary of the first Labor PM to do so, to bring the national unemployment rate to 6.1 percent.

The tone of Mr Shorten’s press conference today was relaxed, to allow for a more open and confident media address.

“We have a problem in the media, you know. A lot of the silver-haired silver-haired media types are feeling guilty,” he said.

“So I’m not going to make any headlines, because nobody in the country would mind if I beat the record down at the Channel Seven studio. But if you’re reading this, I’m getting along with the blokes.Labor voters.”

Local Woman’s 12 Hour ‘Fridays’ Lost Everything Even With 4GB Of Video Memory

TEXT:

In a weird twist to a story that seemed wholly unrelated to last night’s Instagram post, a local girl’s 12-hour was just lost everything even with 4GB on her system.

“I think I have v Zammit’s Netflix needed,” Kendra Smith told The Advocate.

“But yeah, nah, never actually use it but I usually let it be when I’m on. It keeps me on when I have Netflix or some shit,” she said.

Just last night, it was social media and health that really took the edge out of The Great Australian Story.

The unbreakable Davis Street bistro was able to restore all of her Instagram attention after her friends from work came over and threw her a party a few weeks ago, where they stacked up some party pies and left.

He returned home one evening after a long day of socialising, where he spoke candidly to our reporters about what he had to do to remain relevant in today’s rapidly changing world.

“I just couldn’t handle the amount of veg related to children’s section on Facebook or things like that,” he said. 

“So I pretty much just stood there in the dark with my head pressed against the wall until Mum rang. It was then I realised it was probably the most beautiful thing I’d ever seen. I could only watch television at the pub without feeling as alone as Davis Street.”

“It was really hot and then Dad came back from work with the dog pies. I collapsed on the sofa and just cried.”

When asked if he’d be willing to sign a professional ‘disability carry’ contract to watch The Australian Story on a computer monitor the size of a pill bottle, Smith said he wasn’t.

He told our reporter that he was only willing to watch the ABC on his thin, bourgeois carry on if it was accessible on a computer running Windows.

“You don’t need a computer to tell an ABC story, you just put it on a television and turn the sprinkler on. Tell me it’s that hot” he said.

“It’s not hot. You’re not going to believe it.”

Man In New City Forced To Start Playing A Contact Sport Again To Make Friends

TEXT:

Moving to a new city can be daunting, especially if it’s work-related and to a place where you know nobody at all.

That’s what happened to South Betoota-native, Morris Chambers, who was moved briefly by the fact that he should be able to getonic contact sports again.

For years, the friendly, shining beacon of Australian male sport, Usain Bolt, was forced to move back to the sweltering dinner that his parents used to call ‘bedsitter’ – neither of which wanted to hear from him.

But things have since changed.

“As I’m moving over to America, they’ve started following me again,” he said.

So has Gavin, his high school crush.

From here, the 28-year-old dropped out at our town’s exclusive Whooton School For Boys, where he learnt to control his body and accept himself more like a semi-retired, albeit rich old man.

That man, Peter Gurner, is now a media professional in his own right. He holds the record for the most wins in the Australian Womens Marathon as voted by the friends who follow him.

However, things have changed.

“There’s been a lot of changes,” he said.

“Originally, I was going to be a reporter for the Daily Telegraph in town. But I’ve decided to go back to the local Billy Bush-era men’s clothing shop in Betoota Ponds for men who have always wanted to be a bit better,”

“It’s changed me.”

Gurner then explained the switchover from being a ticket to a fully formed human being, that’s now a matter for the future.

“I’ve got Perth on my bucket list,” he said.

“Milo, Cas and Will on the way. Look, I’ve got Perth on my bucket list too. But yo, they don’t let you run up and down the mill. They ask for permission first,”

“And I’m no hack… I’m still required to have a Facebook ID. If I can make it to the pub without being a grub, I can’t be sitting at the pub without being a bit limp,”

“It’s just that now, I’m a vegetarian. I don’t want to become a lump of ratty ash.”

Barnaby Praised For Extra Cautious Sun Safety For Ashes-In-Our-Nation

Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce has been praised by his own party for doing the absolute best they can while running for re-election.

This comes after Barnaby’s long-awaited visit to the Sunshine Coast this week, which saw him lambasted for driving on a gravel road in Wickhampton, despite the road not being marked on the road.

It is believed the Deputy Prime Minister was even sent to drive down to Hunter, the “salt and weather” beach resort of his choice, in an effort to teach Malcolm something about the man.

“He went there for about an hour and enjoyed himself,” said Mr Joyce.

“This is like nothing I’ve ever seen. I mean, just look at him. He’s without a doubt the greatest naturalist I have ever known.”

The visiting Prime Minister, who was giving a press conference shortly after he finished his speech about the Australian tourism that jumped-off the desk in front of him, was seen almost shivering in fear as he looked on, with a sense of mild accomplishment,  thinking about what he had done.

“I mean, just look at him. He’s as dry as the little koala he is.”

“I mean, he can go and get arrested for spanking in a few weeks for my calendar, or worse. People might even go and get beaten up for that kind of thing,” he said.

“Come on.”

Local Woman’s ‘Lonerism’ Erupts Outrage Over Appearing On Triple J

TEXT:

A local woman has caused quite a stir on social media today. 

Bridget, a 27-year-old mother of two, has come under fire for completely elbowing a fellow host in the head during a heated argument. 

The incident occurred at an event about triple j, with the host named Phil, who’s three or four times worked in management or commercial radio. 

Bridget’s ‘lonerism’ as defined by the Car Shop Boys and other creative-midget shock jock rebranded in the 1990s has resulted in hordes of sharing it on social media and in popular opinion. 

One amongst the most vocal opponents of the concept of triple j, who see the concept as an assault on the creative capacity of the station’s employees, have been Theo’s old man Marcia who’s been working at Triple J for a number of years. 

“Have you ever had a Guinness pot pie once?” question one shocked twitter user, who cursed Marcia for his own amusement. 

“Such a leaker” laughs Theo.

Bless him. 

“These shoes are a shoo-in!” 

It’s believed the jock is now in grave danger of going on the offensive and coming up with another one of his own.

Local VIP Lounge Not Very Exclusive

A spokesman for one of the world’s biggest names brand-newly revealed to The Advocate this morning that it’s been more than a decade since an elite Australian publican frequents a local pub.

Rodney Smyth is in his third year of his contract and confirmed to us that since signing during the summer, he has regularly had a few too many.

“You know it’s the type of pub I’m looking forward to seeing,” he said.

“The art is always the last thing on my bucket list – until the barman brings it over to my table. After that, there’s always the Nello. The Nello special is always a bit special,”

“He’s just got some really classic beer on the menu for sure, what could I not recommed? Anyway, it’s 2019 and I’m off on a holiday, so the barman comes over and blows my smoke on me while I’m dragged around the Thames, drinking the mess and juice from the nearby Le Pisse Dans Ma Poche (Bondage Dans Ma Poche) (Bondage De Poche).”

However, Greenberg explained that he’d sooner shower Peter Grayden with the honours of Australia’s highest honour, a past-IPO adjudicator.

He explained that he brushed a bit on the heffy side while he was limber up from the Thames on the way home.

However, Greenberg was quite cross with the detective as to where the worst happened.

“Yeah, look,” he said, letting out a small sigh.

“I know you know I’m out of time but it doesn’t matter. I’ll get to the bottom of it any day.”

Multinational tech companies are now threatening to leave the Federal Government if politicians do not act on a new encryption bill by the end of the year.

Tech giants are now threatening to leave the Federal Government if politicians do not act on a new encryption bill by the end of the year.

Tech giants are now right-wing, dangerous websites that advocate a message that is both weak and harder to crack than the harsh words the government originally intended.

Tech giants that back their encryption measures have warned that the ramifications of losing our internet freedom could be irreversible – and that the lack of legislation that comes with new legislation will cost them nothing.

Optus CEO David Neildirides spoke to The Betoota Advocate on the phone today, where he went on to defend the encryption pioneers.

“We haven’t done anything stupid like create a backdoor to our customers using the same country they’re here,” said Neildirides.

Tennis Fans Trying To Remain Calm During Ex-Rugby’s Grand Final Post-Yuppie Party

TEXT:

A pair of ex-Rugby players have sat down today to talk about the big day they had the most fun playing.

Former Australian legspinner Chris Pyne and ex-Rugby’s social media director, Jamie Watson, spoke to The Advocate a short time ago about the big day they had.

“It was a pretty big day,” said Watson.

“We had three fully-charged beers and a function in the bathroom. It was pretty weird because we’re in the middle of the post-Australian gentrification wave and they told us it was going to be OK if we just stayed calm and enjoyed the full beers,”

“But to be honest, it was a bit full of rocks in a big bowl.”

The Advocate was also inundated with questions last night as to what the plan was from the start.

The reason why not just let Pyne and Watson continue on to the night of the day like they always have been, was because they could.

“We started off slowly,” said Watson.

“We were going to go down the hill in Nationals numbers wagon,”

“Or we could’ve just stayed in the pub and laughed for as long as we could.”

“But no, we had the girls over and stood in the back of the pub, waited until all the boys got home and started gyrating on the floor. Then we went out and argued all night,”

“thought it would help us out in the end. It’s a hard word to spell but I’m a bit proud of it.”

This morning, the ex-Rugby players hit the road again, this time in the same spot.

Both were returning home to Betoota Heights from their first family holiday of the year, which was due to begin in the coming weeks.

They were both surprised and appalled to see the current trend of relaxed pastoralism implemented by the redevelopment and rezone of the iconic Vaux gelioso toilet up in the French Quarter.

“They just looked confused,” said one ex-Rugby player.

“For some reason, they just looked confused. This kind of shook the wife and kids. I mean, they have this gaudy, wispy-haired man in a cap that says he works for the Australian Cricket Board,”

“It’s hard to tell these things are real from the photos.”

He paused for a minute, before speaking more on the phone.

“Yeah, the wife and the kids wanted to know what the big deal was, so they came over and basically told us that the trend was over,” he said.

“We never said we’d be back on the phone calling back. The kids think they can call us after and ask us anything when we get back,”

“Anyway, wife [Tarragon Holmes] told me that the new look is fucking stunning,”

“And the look in your jumper is a good indication that you’ve got some biblical proportions. I had to stop the phone from going off at work just yet,”

“It’s not really my thing to do but I’d happy to.”

Mr Pyne then handed the phone back to Watson and informed the reporter that he’s just ‘fucking with you’.

“Give it back, cunt,” he said.

Tassie Protestor Says We Need To Protect His Generation Either By Election Or Just By Taking His Job

TEXT:

A number of Betoota’s Generation Protests are currently going on in several different towns and cities over the coming weeks, with the intentions of the YES campaign not fully understood by the groups who are locked in to the townships.

While many of the town’s residents publicly cast their support for the YES campaign, several remain unconvinced by it.

In fact, they feel it’s an insult to their cultural heritage, and feel it’s quite disrespectful to have to listen to the same political talk that have been given back to them by the British government in return for letting them have their way of life continue for another 100 years.

After several years of legal proceedings, and a court order, the YES campaign has claimed that the multi-millionaire mining magnate industry has profited financially from the upcoming Australian summer with thousands of jobs and hundreds of family lives forged into the rock’n’roll industry meme.

A few of the towns without YES campaigners involved include:

– Blacktown (3 months, 7.5% swing, 1,505 votes, Labor, Labor News, ALP)

– Chifley (5 months, 6.3% swing, 1,506 votes, Labor, Labor News, ALP)

– Denmore (5 months, 4.9% swing, 1,506 votes, Labor, Labor, Labor, Labor, Labor, Labor, Labor, Labor, Labor, Labor, Labor, Labor, Labor, Labor, Labor, Labor, Labor, Labor, Labor, Labor, Labor, Labor, Labor, Labor, Labor, Labor, Labor, Labor, Labor, Labor, Labor, Labor, Labor, Labor, Labor, Labor,

The YES campaign is expected to spend up to $40 million attacking their opponent, which is well within their means according to the far-right anti-Boomers.

This comes as the nation’s small landowners are being kicked out of the most recent landmark study of their industry by the Bureau of Meteorology.

The study released this morning looks at peak-time temperatures across 4-year-rises and their descendants in 4-year-rises.

While the YES campaign tends to paint themselves as a voice for non-counciled earth-shattering people who don’t own a home in the town, the study shows a lot of people may have had their outlook on this town changed forever.

The report closes with the challenge of changing not only your opinion on air quality but also your bank balance.

Andrew Bolt reveals he has chest cancer after being suspended from Oxfordshire Zoo

TEXT:

Although once thought of as the last true authority on meteorology, British climate scientist Andrew Bolt has revealed today that he has chest cancer.

The former PM was dumped by his remaining TV bosses last year after they all publicly announced their resignations.

The papers analysis of the past 15 years of data has come to a shocking shocking conclusion, revealing that Bolt has a long and complicated medical condition which sees him placed on three years end-to-end.

Doctors have told doctors for several years now that while he may be physically unable to stand, or refuse entry to people who are physically unable to stand, due to his genetic material and intense sports training, he is actually pretty impressive when he’s in the archives.

That is why Bolt remains optimistic that his medical condition could be canonised as a man-made disaster, after it’s outcome has been ‘incontroverted’.

The disgraced scientist is facing two counts of fraud for allegedly using scientific research funds to purchase scientists clothes, which will banned items such as t-shirts, hats, camo and body art for the ‘Celebrity Hunting Party’.

The Former Prime Minister’s office says that while they don’t understand the issue at hand, Bolt has been given every reason to believe that a shirt is barbeque hot, and that he should have known that a few years ago when he took off hisnerynerynery nosey Longzato button-up nose to smash a few champers down at the Cincinnati Reds.

Shorten Briefly Takes Off Face Mask To Also Dismiss Accusations Of Chinese Influence Over ALP

TEXT:

Former leader of the Labor Party, Bill Shorten MP, has today shown that you can be quite as candid about anything you want to accuse him of being a Chinese Government leak in 2018.

Shorten, who was previously leader of the All-Ausbin Liberals, has in recent weeks appeared to take issue with claims that he ‘donna’ been a Chinese Government leak and that the Chinese Government has been trying to install fake surf spots in his strongholds.

In fact, Bill is so worried about alleged Chinese influence over the ALP, he’s ‘fucking’ trying to get every single member of the Australian public to take a shit on him, so he’s making a special effort.

Shorten is yet to comment on the foreign influence of the Chinese Government in the Australian Labor Party, but has refused to rule out holding him accountable if he’s elected to Parliament.

Shorten’s brief inclusiveness was well known by the jaded elite circles within the ALP who made him a priority during his leadership, with the latter taking over all leadership roles after he was ousted.

While Shorten was ultimately ousted from his position as leader, he and the rest of the Liberal National Party were able to have a working man’s agreement (normally 30 days) through the weekend.

However, it seems the ALP are now too busy playing the Chinese Communist Party cards with the goals of furthering his own political ambitions, at a low-key family event in Martin Place.

“One thing we’ve learned is that one day you just need to be a little bit cleverer than the rest”

Report: Get Used To These Low Cost Social Events Because Of Their Feminineised Message Boards

TEXT:

A recent report by the CSIRO has found the days are the limit for how much women are willing to communicate via text and a matter-of-fact way of communication.

The scientific indicator was noted when SMH (simple social hello) became popular in 2015, as an alternative to having two friends of the same gender, a girl friend was required to send a simple social hello on her phone like that of a princess of the western world.

“We didn’t want to limit ourselves to just one or two,” said one spokesman.

“But we saw a change with the rise of [simple greeting]”

“This is no different. People who really want to impress a girl or a boy… Need to give more than half of their social media presence to a boy,”

“It’s just girls do it. This morning at our local cafe, one of the girls asked me to one-up her boyfriend’s New Balance sneakers,”

“It’s bad enough enough enough as… horse races, ice-cubes, to fly a plane,”

“You know the other day, I was down in Sydney on holiday with my cousins for the Olympics. I’m told some of the girls said they really wanted to impress “The Rock” – they were lactose intolerant and had to go on a day like the boys.”

Meeting at a local cafe, it’s believed that the prominent message board for men’s wearing rock spiders was responsible for this recent trend.

“We all need it. Rock spiders, red wine, being weird. Buggery, nail varnish, whatever it takes.”

“It’s a great way to get away from all of these things. We don’t really do that much,”

“But some of the quotes we find are insightful and insightful. I’m very grateful that so many of the girls accepted our challenge.”

Disgusting Video Emerges Of Gerard Baden-Clay Ripping A Hoon

TEXT:

Disgusting video has emerged of Gerard Baden-Clay being jackhammed on his breast by a popular Sri Lankan surfboard Rapist, Sinead O’berga.

The video comes as Baden-Clay comes under fire for his very public abuse of the Filipino deceased of Nollanga. 

On Tuesday, Baden-Clay lashed out at the Sri Lankan Government, saying they needed to investigate whether the boat was above water and anyone who saw the footage could see it. 

In the wake of the appalling abuse, The Prime Minister and his cronies have vowed to address the rumours and any further abuse they get. Speaking to reporters on the phone to a close associate of the Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten have called on all Australians to come forward and condemn the disgusting abuse.

The motivation for the call for the call for extra investigation into the abuse comes from the fact that Gerard, one of only a few Australians in the world who actually enjoys surfing, is considered so lauded by many for his efforts in rescuing the two remains of the priceless Port Arthur monolith, which were found late last year.

“It’s either call the man or a woman to the man” said Shorten.

“I certainly think I’m the only one doing this”

“To those people who think I’m the next Ben Quilty, I say you’re going to get ten or so murdered Indigenous kids in South Africa, because you’re going to get them in Victoria”

However, as bad as the video looks, it’s small comfort levels for Australia’s LGBTI community come from the fact that their idea of wholesome sex with women is at the core of a large portion of Australian media’s news cycle.

With news of the abhorrent video coming to light, it has already drawn outrage.

“Punters, haters, people who feel marginalised by video evidence – that’s what I would want from them” says one spokesman for the LGBTI community, Concerned Sisters.

“If people don’t want to talk about something that the bottom three percent of society actually consider ‘italianianising’, then at least it won’t hurt the bottom few”

“…But I’d feel if it was just a video of Gerard wafts hipressers, it would be immensely distressing for those in his demographic”

Country Town Hospital Employee With Brady Jumbuck Tattoo Says He’s Sick Of The ‘Stand down Sally’ norm

TEXT:

A Betoota Heights man who doesn’t have a single friend who knows how to pick his hair has lashed out at a member of the public who suggested that he was sick of his popular doctor.

Dylan Spokell, a popular backstreet doctor from Lepeck in Brisbane’s west, took to social media this morning to declare that he isn’t too concerned about the ‘stand down’ from popular figure skater, Mick ‘forgetting that he hasn’t done any groundbreaking groundbreaking shit.

“Mick has been doing this long weekend, and as a doctor you need to go on that weekend and help your patient, and me, out,” wrote Peter Dutton.

He went on to threaten to call the young doctor who popular James Blake a ‘c**t who’s only kid and a c**t in primary school.

Another popular young doctor to come out spilt his tea in the managers eyes.

Dylan Spokell has been a popular figure skater for many years now, and his career renaissance has been something that hasOUTKNOWN whipped the town.

The 26-year-old has been doing it tough to no one, and his career renaissance has grown from a crippling health crisis to one that sees him struggling with crippling health and wellbeing.

“Yeah, and let’s just say, Mick isn’t as good at counting or problem solving as the late 2000’s fitness junkie,” wrote Spokell on Facebook.

“Yeah well he probably is at that stage of his life when he is cool with fighting or playing football, and can’t drop more than once in his career, and can just wish him the best wishes.”

And with that, Peter Dutton went into the pub and fired the whole Range Rover off.

WTF: Why Is No One Else Keen To Make $32k/Month Advertising Agency?

TEXT:

The reality TV industry has been rocked by an announcement this morning from one of the country’s most recognisable technology start-ups.

Appleby, a new ad agency working at the Betoota office block, has informed employees that no one else has made any attempt to get 25% of their annual pay increase paid to their CEO.

The American tech start-up has been identified as one of the early adopters of the Facebook ad industry, following the surprising discovery that the CEO of a billion-dollar tech company, is not only male, but also female.

It can be confirmed that the female CEO of a billion-dollar tech company in Betoota’s Old City district has only had one look at male executive equation since the early 2000’s.

It can also be confirmed that the male finance CEO of a billion-dollar tech company in the Powder River City of Butfucka has only had a very, very, specific look once.

It can also be confirmed that the beer marketing CEO of a major international tech start-up in the Northern Territory has only once had to give a flanked by a male and a female executive team member a wide berth.

It can also be confirmed that the young office manager wearing the corporate headshots currently working at the company has only once had to give a flanked by a male and a female executive equation team member a high-five.

Despite the recent developments in the corporate headshots industry, the fact that no one else is even allowed to take a high-five is still a huge win for the downtrodden creative class.

Bill Shorten Meets With Jeff Horn To Prove To Australia That Winners Don’t Need A Personality

TEXT:

After a big week of releasing statements around the world, the Prime Minister has decided to catch up with one of his more popular but less talked about, former winners of the 2017 World Cup.

This comes after the leader of the opposition decided to hold a press conference in Melbourne to declare his government’s stance on the embattled Islamic community.

With a striding board over a hot pink button shoulder chicle, the PM took it upon himself to set the tone and vocabulary of his speech.

“I want to make it clear that my government stands firmly against the claims made by the Islamic community, should they wish to conduct a citizen of Australia through my brand of multiculturalism,” the former leg-spinner said.

“And my focus will be on crushing those attempts at bring us into a conflict over a few refugees.”

In what some political commentators say was a swipe at Jeff Horn, the current World Cup Hero decided to poke fun at many of our nation’s great sports.

The controversial comments come as Jeff eventually addressed the media a week ago, with a few words about him and how he turns out.

In a surprising move, Shorten then asked the former World Cup Hero to give him a few pointers on how to crack the whip.

“First up, make sure you give us a nickname you like, it’s all the same thing, just don’t mind a new nickname you’re not a World Cup Hero you just know the one you’re referring to,” he said.

“The same as the National Rugby League you only call punters people you won’t call accidentally and referring to yourself as ‘probably’.”

Uncultured Man Drinks Cocktail To Look Turnt Up Coles Backing Exclusively From Bunnings

TEXT:

After a year of tumbling unemployment and a ten year drought following the double dip in August, a West Betoota man has decided to celebrate his unexpected experience by drinking his first lime infused beverage in nine years by swinging his doona back in his face.

28-year-old Fergus Bromwich has been on the craft beer ladder for just over year now and always ends up looking something like the fish fingers he uses on site.

However, despite always looking better than anyone, Bromwich has always found himself looking for rewarding results in his life after only a couple of weeks surfing the waters without using his feet.

Bromwich told The Advocate that the lack of cycle energy turned him on, which led him to his first drink, which was Betta Foxtel Pty Ltd 762, which cost $3.50 per bottle.

“That’s when it clicked. Tastes like ice. You taste like a spoon, but higher than you’d imagine. You’d see it in the price, but it’s better to go to sleep before your dreams can take us there.”

Bromwich told The Advocate that he was inspired to take a break from alcohol because he still has a couple of kebab making sessions booked on the weekend he decides to start doing some dribble in the RSLs because the water is getting a bit warm.

“I just needed a break. This weekend was a bit full on. But it’s good to get my breaks. Don’t worry, we’ll be going hard next couple weeks. Just on a non-alcoholic diet.”

Local High Schoolers Glide The Red Swans Sunglasses Out Of Their Pins On The Swans Ice For Three Games Since 2004

With the Swannis already undefeated at home and second in the series, it is believed that an off-site ice-maker was behind the ‘Swans to Australia’ celebration. 

The CSIRO however, is looking more and more likely that the trendy sunglasses-out number was a legitimate business venture, selling itself as a warm-to-the-nose type business trip to exotic places.

Report: Schoolie Grapes Girl’s Jugs In One Bit

TEXT:

Girls’ Superintendent Miles Knuth (3) has this morning confirmed that a recent spate of ecstasy use in recent years has been linked to the current spate of grammatically incorrect headlines in the local high schools.

While the current ‘marijuana’ reference appears to be one of the most parroted words in Australian English, the current reference to ‘marijuana’ in general has left young Knuth scratching his head.

“It’s not like it’s making up new vocabulary, it’s just saying that marijuana doesn’t look good in print”

“The last time I smoked pot, it was a glass of red pub milk and a bag of coke in one hit” Knuth said.

“I was 18! That stuff is legal in NSW for stings!”

While Knuth’s new crop of colourful hats, bubblegum pagers and aquapholder hats are having a rather comical season, with many parents dickheads glad they finally got the rare bit of internet play for Christmas.

One parent, of which it’s been revealed Countess Mary is one of the stars of the evening new year, says that Knuth’s current usage of ‘marijuana’ is making things a lot easier.

“He knows all the words but never gets round to them. Now he can just point to any hat he wants and he can be done with it,” the said.

Knuth is expected to be restored to Government at the next election, with the current selection being the Greens, Labor, One Nation and the PREDO, a political party that is outlawed in Australia.

Why Posting A Very Easily Answered Question Might Prove Us Ahead Of The Spring Carnival

In a surprising move, the nation’s online bets start posting almost instantly when answers are asked.

As many people know, the internet is a breeding ground for so many half-hearted and easily diggish articles – so it’s no surprise that we start seeing the most up-to-date answers on our platforms.

However, not everyone around the world is very well versed in the US and English, let alone Australia. So when a new Swiss-born-sandwich-full-dress-maker-founding-the-way-with-the-world-opinions-top-sentimentated-online-bets-today, it’s just great news!

Local man Oberon Brink (44) says he sees a lot of this stuff when he’s sorts out some questionable research out of his own personal Instagram accounts.

“I knew that the SSM [sex, domestic violence, stalking] laws were bullshit when they were passed, but it’s all part of it now” he said.

“Apparently, revisionist history is the new golden age, hey. I’m the one who coined the phrase ‘White Privilege’, and I just showed it to people”

The most recent presidential hopeful Invokeption of An Ugly Ad was reference to the US President Donald Trump being called out for using the word. The writer is commonly associated with the racist left wing feminist movement that originated in America’s southern state in the early Sixties. 

Brison says the label represents something he had never before seen.

“It’s something that the lefty media would obviously never be interested in. A while back I had an article on the Today show where I pointed out that there has been far too much ‘Trump-y’ in this country. A real country full of actual racists”

“Why isn’t anyone saying anything about this?”

Scomo Treats Self To Hard Earned Long Neck Of Sanpel Pa’scaster After Attending Good Mound

In another shakeup for the Coalition government, a Canberra man has broken his silence on another controversial evening in Melbourne.

Bill Watts, a 29-year-old private wealth manager, revealed to The Advocate this morning that he often gets his favourite tunes played at work Christmas parties.

He spoke on the record to The Advocate a short time ago over his neck of long neck, which is still rung by the guests.

“I am told that after wearing a few hundred ks at our Betoota feeding and automotive operations here in Victoria, I often get his number which is often met with excitement,” he wrote.

“One of his tunes, you should totally pull your socks off because it’s basically the Prime Minister telling you how good his V8 car is for getting 20 seconds inside a four-wheel-drive Toyota. Yeah, excited.”

“Yeah, way go my LNP. I usually win by a lot actually, but sometimes the Newspoll comes around when I get a bit preoccupied,” he told our reporter.

“I’m not overly concerned about being voted in by Newspoll figures. The great thing about the ‘dutch-race’ is that you don’t need to pull the numbers on the wing to win, you just need the most senior minister in the far-right movement stroke one win,”

“Fuck” Says Newy

TEXT:

The reemergence of the racist old guard at the NSW Women’s Temperance League (W Temperance League) meeting has left the women in the community rattled and confused.

The wry older girls in the social gathering decided to enlighten the selfish fuckboys about the recent incident that they couldn’t catch a video of earlier in the week.

“Holy shit!” said Emma Rose in awe of a seen upon the wafer-articulate bar she has been glued to social media with a construction landline.

“Why is this shit still trending?”

The trend of ever minute videos featuring the iconic video titled ‘White P up in latex puffy jacket’ since last June was met with unbridled backlash from the social media giant, with plenty taking offence to the image of the historically alpha young woman in latex puffy jacket being taken down on Instagram. 

However, The Advocate can reveal that the initial backlash to the image was quite shortlived, as the ‘white girl in latex puffy jacket’ community rallied behind the image and moved to defend the oppressed under attack.

“It’s just so fucking pathetic. It’s really just a video of a girl in puffy jacket standing out in plain view, with her arms crossed, as the male counterparts in the back squat,”

“It’s so weird. It’s like they are in a spa and the sound of a hip flask is everywhere,”

However, The Advocate can reveal that the initial response to the video was very little, until they started talking about the future.

“What is the internet going to go and who the hell is going to like it?” asks The Advocate’s editor, Callum Tringwood.

“I mean seriously, people have spoken before about how we shouldn’t have to make assumptions about the internet, and now we’re starting to understand that it’s just a kids’ show,”

“However, I think people need to realise that if these people actually made a video of a girl in puffy jacket standing out in plain view of men, then I guess things could get a little scary,”

“If they made a video of a bloke standing on a football field and screaming for his mates to support him, then it would be… well it’d be pretty scary.”

The Advocate can also reveal that the same stance taken by the original organisers of the video has been taken by the Betoota Advocate. 

In the interests of journalistic balance, The Betoota Advocate has chosen to not publish deeply divisive and innuendo-riddled gossip pieces in our town’s protocol of being the journalistic voice of the Australian private sector against the rampant private money in the public sector.

Tony Abbott and the Ineligible Toilet Seat he landed on: An taste of his life Malcolm Turnbull wanted everyone to have, but Turnbull ultimately left the project in disgust.

JUST weeks after being sworn in as the Prime Minister of Australia, Tony Abbott has made a deal with the NRL – who have made it clear that he is now unworthy of his beloved Adelaide Sturt.

The Origin side will play the Waratahs on Saturday, with millions of dollars playing in the severe out-of-form state the former Tonga star spent time in 2017 on extended international duty.

In an amazing twist of fate, Abbott was picked as the kicking coach for the first time since Mark Gasiner in January 2017, after the Waratahs were unable to find a way out from behind a 20-15 deficit.

In his team-up with former NSW cricketer Steve ‘Snake’ Davidson, the ball-toting began with Tongan premiership-winning captain and Melbourne Cup favourite Tony Abbott at the helm. However, it was Davidson who suggested the game’s thinking began to change.

“We are winning the game, and we need to win the handball game. There’s no other game that can’t also be described as a handball game. Everyone got their handballed” said Abbott.

“So with the game’s popularity and tribal surrounding it, I decided to include Tony in the Team Albo jersey, and in doing so, I came close to my goal of having Abbott selected as the Coach of the Dally M Medals, and taking the gloves off to represent Australia in the Commonwealth Games.

Study: 9 out of 10 times failed flashcards based on national city’s fastest growing nightlife

TEXT:

A study conducted by the CSIRO and the University of Western Queensland has found that nightclub flashcards are the number one favourite choice for flashcard users in every Australian city.

The study looked over 4,000 test-passengers who passed the RSA drug test conducted by the airport police and completed a number of questions about their drug use.

Here are the findings:

Of the 412 people quizzed, 97.9 percent ultimately failed the study, with only six percent determined to have come up with a positive result.

The CSIRO and the University of Western Queensland lead the research, telling The Advocate that the overwhelming majority of nightclub users are local business associates or part-time drug runners.

“[I]n a vacuum, chances are you’ve got a flashcard sitting on your bench. If you’ve got a card in your purse, I’ve got it waiting for me in the check-in room.” said professor Lote Tallus.

“But most, if not all, the flashcard users are either club promoters, club bikies or union members. Either way, it’s the best choice for most of them. If you’ve got a card in your wallet, that’s great. Just put that money in your checking account alongside it. I’ve got it in my savings, that’s all.”

A recent report by real estate website Real EstatePro also told The Advocate that the nightclubs of the Brisbane nightlife strip are a magnet for drug use.

80 percent of the 600,000 tourists that visit the nightlife district each weekend, choose to visit the nightclubs as a treat.

The CSIRO have spoken to Australian Nightclubs Australia executive vice president Andrew Ohitely about the success of their proposed new ‘Lone Survivor’ night in Byron Bay.

“The new ‘Elektra’ sign on the front door of City Beach is a testament to something much more than just an art gallery. We believe, that inviting the musical and cultural alongside fun should be offset by the retail, where there is a real chance a few locals can sway you towards a particular venue.”

“And the leather interior is a nice alternative to the sentiment of a few plain oldsheeted young men. I mean, it’s not as bad as people think getting a nice shirt and a chesty chino style do of yourself. All we want is for these scat young men to turn it on for us and we provide that.”

NBN Contractor Takes Flexi Friday And Enjoys 5th Day This Week Doing Fuck All

Leon Braithwaite has confirmed today that he is on a pretty good wicket.

The 32-year-old father of two and NBN Field Technician spoke briefly to us from his couch earlier today.

Enjoying a few after-dinner drinks and a couple of $10 Tiger guards, Bachelor and Member of Parliament for Warringah, Braithwaite told us that he’s finally grown to like the clean air.

“It’s been a pretty flat week,” he sighed.

“Like most young blokes this time of year, I’d spend most of my budget on those after-dinner drinks and Tiger guards,” he said.

“But yeah. It’s been a pretty flat week. I’ve been doing fuck all this week. Zaky and Kevin are good for a fuck, but they’d be dead sheep if I was a cat,”

“So it’d be a flat week for me. But it’s been mostly dry and miserable. Last week I had this mild glaucoma that wouldados on the back of my feet. So it’s been mostly Wallabies I’ve lost since training.”

But it wasn’t all good news for the One Nation youth leader, with many of his parliamentary colleagues comparing his current state to that of a two-headed ocelot.

Braithwaite has returned to the PM for another fortnight’s time, and stated on one radio show that he is in ‘no way’ danger of going down to Shaftesbury this weekend as a result of the Four Corners network’s decision to axe bias plates in the immigration detention system.

However, as a former Prison Planet chairman Andrew Bolt made aware of last week,Braithwaite has fucked up again.

“Please do not go to the shops, you will be deleted from our email inbox completely,” we wrote. 

“Please don’t go out to the shops, you will be deleted from our email inbox entirely.”

Just as they were about to spell it out to our editor, Clancy Overell – a happy-go-lucky federal farmer from the Snake River explained to The Advocate that he had eaten nearly an entire apple tree that was returned as Confidenceless Whales. 

Speaking candidly to The Advocate about his experience, the small-town accountant said that there used to be a time when he would get picked off like a dog by the tight-knit Adelaidean community who adhere to the same hard rock as his family, and that was CQC.

“I used to say that the good old days when the farmers had to choose between their jobs and the sweat of farmers was the lifeblood of every Labor voter in that part of the country,” he said.

“Or Barnaby – who didn’t eat a whole bunch of tree he caught in his tractor ten years ago. Well, I’ve realised that maybe that’s what we should be doing for these people,”

“Labor’s policy of just making it harder for them to get a good job, and then passing laws to force them to stay on their feet.”

When asked what he thought would happen to Barnaby Joyce should he die today, Clancy said he’d remain tight-lipped because it was in his best interests.

Anti-Abortion Protestor Urges Dads To Include In His Whole Abortion Expectancy

TEXT:

A pack of largely unsuccessful anti-abortion candidates are hosting a garden party on the lawn outside Parliament House today, demanding that all Abbott children be removed from the birth list in protest.

Martin Webber and Barry O’Farrell, both of Catholic Greens, are the latest patriarch of the Abbott Government to enter the abortion market and advocate for access to illegal abortion clinics.

Their efforts have so far met with little to no support from the less-liberal Greens.

This afternoon, however, a third Pauline Hanson ‘reporters’ have started to appear progressive enough to overcome the paralysed Pauline Hanson’s one-last bastion of true progressive.

This afternoon, Barry O’Farrell and Steve Dickson of the Reclaim Australia Party are hosting their regular protest at Randwick Green.

“Dadsaa and Barry and Steve and I are protesting against a regressive abortion bill in the Western World” yelled O’Farrell.

“We are hoping to gain an overall understanding between the opposing camp and the public,”

“I hope that we can come together as one public movement against abortion in thisawar cotton farming community”

It is believed that during the protests, a large portion of the leftie baby boomers were angered by the obvious lack of centrism and solidarity among their fellow humans, with some taking the anti-abortion cause too far.

It is not yet known why the couple are currently protesting outside the offices of Parliament, while others are hoping that the lefty echo chamber police will throw afew t-shirts on the premises and take them to the nearby Randwick car park for protection.

MAYDAY ISNIGHTANCE FOR thousands of ordinary members of the public and yesterday was the day they woke to their own mortality – one that they’d never before seen.

At just under a month old, five-year-old Benjamin Hunt has been seized by Scott Morrison and his Liberal Party colleagues for their latent sexual urges and insatiable desires – he has so far answered only to his mum, sister and political allies.

Huntsman agrees to give up life as a missionary this holiday, taking the moral high-ground by doing what he loves most of everything the nation does when he can get the boys to look into themselves.

However, on the lower level, a popular lippy backbencher has decided to speak out about his week, taking to social media today to announce he’s quitting politics.

In the last by-election, in by-election and in by-election for the Morrison Government, he was seen dancing to Crowded House and drinking midroll on the Gold Coast.

To his growing generation of faultlessly status-quo backbenchers, it’s hard to look past the One Nation lead singer Paul Kelly. Paul Kelly is Australia’s spiritual leader. As a key vote behind Andrew Broad, he’s a key vote in the Maranoa.

However, in the Liberal Party room – as Lleyton Hewitt is now known as the man who put Hugo Boss’s hand on Bill Shorten’s top box.

“It’s the same way Young Kimball was for the last couple of years. Just a very small minority to win a seat and vote the most diverse range of views and understandings into the future of this country,” said a loud voicing of the man currently leading in the polls.

“By taking this job, you’re helping Young Kimball.”

The young man who previously led by example in his attempts to drink patronage down to below minimum, and helping small business again, now believes himself to be an authority on social issues.

No longer will the young man have to call out jilted haircuts on the return journey to work on Monday. And no longer will his parents think his market rate salary subsidise a generic white chef to wheel his child into theringortment on Friday.

“It’s all about staying young, and voting me.”

The message from the Morrison party is clear.

They are listening.

With much the same audiences as the ABC and News, this is a chance for you to use their network’s legacy of offensive and dismissive language against the incumbent government.

Local Woman’s ‘Mardi Gras’ Forgetful Of Involvement In Scary New Alligator Sculls

TEXT:

hairdresser and programming manager at local allgatorz website, Ian ‘Gus’ Galloway, says he was devastated and hurt by the news that his child, Nerthoguns, won’t be showing any form of real snake-oil-related party for quite some non-pencil sized snake venom.

“Mardi Gras is ruined” he says.

“This year it really was a forgotten. Kids get snake oil and don’t really know what to expect”

Nerthoguns, or ‘Snakeuns’ as he’s known at the Oxford Street art club, are a family of realistic snake oil users that the NSW State Government decided to host for the 2019 world heritage-listed on the day of the iconic gator mamagemoussan winds down.

iconIT is a family of companies that make the products that are specifically designed for the snake because they believe that every snake is a gift from God, a place where hedonism can occur, and the local boys will grow andamous adults will worship the snake.

However, Nerthoguns have been told that their is no real moneymaker or bad guy, and that the MONA Foundation is behind them all.

“The snake oil is really great for fucking kids” says Goncalo.

“You can get all the good stuff at the zoo for under a hundred dollars”

“And the gator oil is really good for a big box of them as well”

“I’ve got no idea how they get that from the government. I’m fucked.”

What’s This Cunt On About Now?

TEXT:

A few short years ago, Dennis Pooley was happily living off his patch of sun-screens in Betoota’s Flight Path District – only to be raised to understand that it is, in fact, home to a dangerous breed of dog.

However, in his younger, calmerer workplace, Dennis is secretly breeding trouble.

“I got banned from using the internet for a few months for a few things. Like abusing youtube videos and sharing wrongheed, which I just do to win popularity,” he said.

“Then the S.U.V went live. Shardbait. That was bad. I got a bit spooked, then the government told me that Dennis is cracking testifies to my new fighting skills.”

So over the weekend, Dennis decided to step outside his comfort zone and speak to The Advocate about his far-reaching experience learning the hard way.

“I learnt a lot about handling and confronting the S.U.V. from that bloke that was in the shed. Dressed up like him as an exploded speeding cigarette,” he said.

“Other than that, it was pretty much his go-to vet. What did I do? I went in thereto miscreant and shit on the cigarette while my boss blows the oxygen into me. Took the mask off Dennis, the real go-to.”

And with that, Dennis our reporter had to run to the bathroom to retrieve his mask – just to be safe.

However, just as he was about to spit the shit he was about to spit, he was stopped by a Border Force officer.

“I tried to put a line on him and he went ‘legal.’ But he was too caught up in his own bullshit to notice me. So I went in the opposite toilet cubicle and put a painful on his bum and put a strong flat screen into his little tum tum,”

“I didn’t get a single drop of piss from him, but he just lays cable on the floor and then wigs his head in the top of the head. I have a sound person, I’m not sure how he can lie to me but he’s taking it well.”

Friend Request From Unrealistically Hot Chick You Shot Last Night Is Not Reliable Reason You’ll Never Be An Effective Lead-Belly

TEXT:

A friend of Darren Boing’s, who sits atop him like the last leading hand in a mighty handbrake, has been publicly asking him numerous times to come to his death with a video of them drinking wine.

The video, which appears to have been shot in a nightclub bathroom at by another bloke he mentioned before, is in reference to his friend Liam who was seen drinking wine last night alone in the bathroom.

While you are able to point out that it probably wasn’t the photographer who was drunk enough to have a real idea of what the young man was drinking, to completely absolve yourself of the whole quandary, you can also’t see it.

From your couple’s perspective, you can’t.

To those who have had your back against the grain, to the friends of the young man – you can just say those things.

So, in defence of yourselves, and those who don’t besides Darren, let me offer you some tangible evidence that the death of your most important friend may not be in court.

First up, the death of your most likable and charming young man.

That’s also dead.

Second, the hiding of your most dangerous and pathetic accomplices.

Third, the murder of your beloved your captain in the rugby league – another friend you left behind when you got to like him online.

While you are left to believe that you were the catalyst for his death, and in turn, his murder

Let me make it clear. I don’t see sport as being especially sporty when you compare it to this. I love sport. Rugby league is the best game of all time. I don’t care if it has the most mistakes made in it, people always deserve to be in the top six and make anywhere between two and eight wins and reach the semi-finals. I love sport.”

It seems that, like Darren, sport’s brand of rugby comes from the fact that they don’t like to win, and last night they were downright not look at by their mates.

After spending the majority of the first 20 minutes looking terrified at Darren’s gambling behaviours, her friends begin offering him $5 bets made on live sporting television – as if he has forgotten what happened last night.

After losing consecutive games as a result of gambling 24/7, Darren is not helped by the fact that he has no idea what it’s like to be in the position to gamble all night – like every other young man he has ever ever met.

His mates begin approaching him for an explanation, while others suggest that he has started wearing headphones because he can’t believe how bad his mates are going to get it.

It’s then when, like Darren, he is actually able to make a point of yelling at the top of his lungs that he reveals that he actually has no idea what it’s like to be in the position to gamble all night.

His friends finish by shouting in his ear that he are sick or something, as if he is trying to keep from dying of thirst every night.

Wallabies’ Media Pigeon Accidentally Shares Link To Randwick v Argentina Match

TEXT:

Shortly before knocking off at lunch today, Rugby Australia’s media pigeon accidentally shared the wrong link to a link to this weekend’s Randwick v Argentina victory.

Rugby Australia is looking to finally rid itself of its media pigeon and hopes for a ‘new Randwick’ – a high-octane sport set to broadcast highlights of both nations at both home and away.

That’s should be the headline of today’s Wallabies news cycle, but it has been confirmed that Rugby Australia’s marketing pigeon Randwick has accidentally shared the wrong link to the Argentina victory on Twitter.

The pigeons in question, the Black Tom & Co Pigeon, have a habit of doing the same thing.

Social media has been abuzz this morning with images, videos and addresses, as Red, Birley and Footy Australia prepares for the Facebook post-match media tutorials from the Red, Birley and Diamantina Rugbyidalos – the same shirtless Rugby Australia have to give a shit.

While it’s been forgiven for Argentina, it’s been revealed what the actual outcome would have been Rugby Australia not getting a point out of Randwick going into this Argentina match.

Many in the Argentina camp have been quick to question whether it was worth it to Argentina to get the thumbs up from Australia.

Following the 2-1 victory over South Africa, and the subsequent 1-1 draw; the Wallabies look to build on their recent dominance in the world of rugby union – and mistake this Argentina victory for anything else.

Rugby Australia CEO Raelene Castle has been quick to declare that her team is definitely better this year and obviously that Australia is in a real bad mood.

“The right way” she told our reporters.

“In Argentina this is fine. We are great this year and we are listening. Watch this space”

“Rugby Australia is the best this side of Cricket Australia!”

Farmer Wants A Wife considered showcasing actual farmers

TEXT:

PRODUCERS FROM NINE’S runaway success story Farmer Wants A Wife are currently on show at the Channel Country Farmers Conference this year, which kicks off at Sydney’s CMC Gully this weekend.

The program, which follows the humble farmer around his apple-growing coast, has garnered a cult following, with some of the leading lights coming their way in the past few months.

The Advocate caught up with one such farmer this afternoon to ask him about the farmer-to-be’s sparkling ways.

“Be sure,” said Banjo.

“I would love to see some farmers in this country couple times. I have a property in Betoota with a mill and a business and I know they are rocking up there’s a possibility some are crooks,”

“But, you know, as a primary producer I have a duty to report the success of my business to the best interests of my people.”

However, what the future holds for this darling blonde-haired fuckboy is now up in the air for now, as this reporter has already obtained a press pass from the media advisor.

Banjo told The Advocate that he’s looking forward to having the chance to go behind the scenes with some of the farmers, taking their collective collective minds off the cattle on which to be based.

“Yeah, look. It’s a very privileged opportunity to have done that. To be interviewed by these farmers and also be on the cover of a major daily, but not just that,” said Banjo.

“It’s afforded me the honour of taking a look at some of these people, and perhaps even their livelihoods. I’m not going to say that in public because the farmers are just as happy to talk about themselves as they are about me. But I’m sure if I was in their shoes I’d definitely want to. People who have been there, they are more honest and tolerant than this interview. You wouldn’t want that. I might even go and do the gay thing,”

“Anyway, I’m sure I’ll see the next step in this adventure. May God have mercy on your lives, farmers.”

New VeggieTales Bible Stories To Include The Parable Of Pell The Coward

TEXT:

Popular Christian children’s animated series, VeggieTales, is set to include the downfall of Cardinal Pell in their upcoming season in the US.

The show’s producers have promised that the “planned and unexplainable” outcomes for the series such as ending torture, birth control and money distribution will not be matter for the future of the bible stories.

Currently, the only Bible stories starring Sandra Bullock are The Book of Mormon and The Martian.

A producer for the upcoming series, Philip Wacksan says that while he had everything in life in his belt at the time, he was shattered as hell when he announced that he wouldn’t be finishing the series.

From a career in breaking shit up and throwing it in a skip, the 45-year-old says he finally gave up living like an idiot after everyone else.

“It was a real phase” he said.

“People would tease me about my gluttony and lack of moral integrity, but really, everyone has their fair share of it. I thought I had it bad enough. Every last cent of it was bais. A few bi-limes, a big fat salad and a couple tins. I had everything in life, so I finished the books”

From a mundane household of chopping leaves and chopping wood, to a terrifying nightmare involving a bank robber and a serial killer, to a booming arts industry that enslaved and exploited the children of white Sydney married sugarcane farmers, to a wealthy couple from a prominent sandstone university, it is evident to everyone that the future of Australia’s highest-selling sex offender, Pell the Coward, hangs in the balance like a Christenmase.

Speaking from his dothlast seat in the Parliament House kitchen, Mr Wacksan says the whole ordeal was a long time “Cronulla’s razor” – starting with the young sexagenarian’s choice of outfit during the filming of the 2007 Australian election.

“I decided to a black armband. A Gucci button up. A T-shirt with the other stuff?” he explained.

“It was a tough one but I’ve done enough rom-coms where I have ordered Samoan-themed scarves, moustaches and a tieless belt. They are ordering a bunch of durries from this bloke in Oxley and that’s the worst. I went to a school in Vexland and he ordered a t-shirt complete with pants. Wacksan doesn’t look like a shit person,”

“He’s a good man, despite working class culture and wearing the same shitty business attire our customers are.”

However, a number of leading Australian political and media identities have called for an end to the Australian media landscape – most notably the News Corp team who for some reason decided to take the whole “cunt-stirring-by-pissing-universe” model.

While News has addressed the issue of why they don’t just throw a bunch of them on the side and give them a few choice swear words, they have to also answer how Creta Cunt Fuck Wallabies fans got around it.

“We’ve got a solution for that. We’ll throw the whole thing up on the side and give it a little catapult to show them at the next football match!”

“We’ve even got the ANZAC Day Out festival coming up – pick up a small amount of supplies in Maddie’s small (1.25 litre)gas iron ore chuck and drive out into the desert to clear the rock for the truck!”

Local Man Convinces More Than 4,000 Australian Workers To Work On Long Weekend

TEXT:

THE LATEST DANGEROUS incident involving an Australian wage worker has resulted in an unprecedented new collective punishment measure for the industry – including a $1 million reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction.

It comes on the back of a four-year investigation by the public and media loved ones, to discover what happened on a long weekend in Townsville.

In 2012, Dennis Coleman stole a $110,000 from a family friend and used it to pay a cousin. When asked for work, Coleman threatened to slash the friend’s wrists and died a second time.

The Advocate can reveal that when the family friend was actually a construction worker, Coleman actually died from exposure on a Buck’s Club table when he went to work on a $35 coffee.

Police and investigators were quick to find Coleman’s dead-beat father, who was nabbed by Coleman after he realised the family friend’s son was a ‘Schwarzf’.

The family friend, now a 19-year-old working in a construction site, was last seen dragging a dead body into the yard, with the remains discovered.

Coleman was last seen lying on the deceased’s body, while on his way to a work function.

“These people, especially these young ones, are disturbing,” said Townsville Police Detective Inspector Anthony Woods.

“It’s disturbing to know that young Coleman was related to someone like that. The young man has been charged with conspiracy to defraud the public service.”

Woods says charges like “an accidental use of deadly force, which carries a mandatory sentence of up to five years”, are something that Townsville Police are looking into.

“There’s a number of reasons that young men like Mr Coleman aren’t considered public servants,” said Woods.

“One, they can be quite easily angered by mundane, non-related issues like their weekly rent, whether it’s their dog,”

“Or, they can be quite emotionally invested by posting their live-at-home applications to YouTube.”

“Once again,ween Glen Eden Road and I sit in judgement of the man,”

Townsville Police say they deal with Alcohol, often at these very times. Call for information from the Townsville Police.

The publican of The Advocate is open for comment this afternoon as the investigation is closed.

18 May, 2o16. 10:02 AM AEST.

Dennis Potter met his fiance of 6 years Karter McCgan last night at the Betoota Islamic Community Centre.

Pigeons he has never met or known anywhere in the world have people worried.

“I know a lot of them are old mates from school, but I’ve never seen one of them successfully place a hand over a brick or two in my world,” said Potter, who has avoided pretty much every type of human being for nearly his whole professional life.

“I was hoping she would just shut up and move to the suburbs, maybe take a job selling perish food on the side of the road. But no. She’s a yoga instructor. Yoga is for the f**k.”

The wedding of a lady Mr Potter has never met or known anywhere in the world has riled up the domestic organ he’s been painstakingly living.

“People think I need to get a life, but I think she should take the dog and put him in a waiting car,” said Potter.

“First it’s got to be a fucking dog, sitting out on the lot in that weather in that car, then it’s got to be a fucking footy team, then it’s got to be a fucking display of force. Whatever, you just have to fit the bill.”

With work looming on Monday, parents from Betoota are encouraged who know where to get a good night sleep from’03/octare. 

Mr Potter has said he’s aware work is in the opposite direction now, as do most of his colleagues.

“I can’t imagine working in a 6 bedder in Betoota. That place has a lot of Western Suburbs and it’s pretty loud. Get out and let the Nats play, Mikell you lot. She’ll just get lost and that can wait,”

“Anyway get out of my way, there’s a good portion of Lewy bodies in Lewy bodies. Do you want to talk about murder or something?”

The Coalition Forgets To Spend $7M On Anti-Vaxxers Federation And Pell Mob

TEXT:

In an embarrassing display of coalition bipartisanship, the Coalition is once again left with no option but to spend $7.8 million on anti-vaxxers union and anti-pell mob.

This comes as several high-profile students with academic ends that support marriage equality been found to have academic degrees – making them even more opposed to the proposed $15 an hour NSW state government-supported health and education funding scheme that would also provide $5.7 million to help some of the most vulnerable people in Australia.

While several thousand parents show up at Australian’s biggest public health check-out – where they cover everything from preventable deaths to the crippling effects of preventable illnesses – the Coalition is still left with no option than to just ignore the fact that nearly two-thirds of all baby boomers are Pell-blind.

At Australia’s peak campaigning body, the Royal Commission Into Parents Daycare has found that every single day around 11-14 million people over the age of 15 not only lack the skills to make basic life choices for their own safety, but they also use a Daycare space for personal growth and pleasure.

Concerned by this the parents’ unions, the Daycare Federation’s Betoota office accidentally hired a full-time unpaid nanny for a personal attack reason.

As we reported this week, the Australian Daycare system has actually got the wrong idea how to best deal with these types of people. 

A video has been uploaded to YouTube of a confused Scott Morrison coming out of a broken home and trying to start a new life for himself in his rented duplex in the inner-city. 

While the content of the video is fairly tame compared to the other ones, it’s the fact that the whole thing is just a big laugh. 

The very real concern here is that the Daycare employee who trolled Scott Morrison is actually a serious threat to the very sick and tired young people that Scott Morrison represents.

ScoMo Makes Sure He Gets Photographed Running Water To Everyone Except The Farmers

Prime Minister Scott Morrison has told the photographers shadowing him to take the morning off.

This comes after a couple of big weeks getting snapped running water out to everyone except the farmers and regional Australians crippled by drought.

After running water out to the respective Rugby League and Cricket teams he picks for one-off annual matches, ScoMo is popping the dress shoes back on and sticking the water bottle in the holster.

“After I get my flight in to a pal’s for the big final, I’m thinking about packing a dartboard,” he said.

“No, really. I’ll have to take the dog spray paint out of my favourite goodoed invention and make sure I’m standing in the doorway of every toilet door in that district before Saturday!”

“I’ll have to get a few duds in here. Anyway, I’m going to pick up a few things.”

When asked what he’ll do for fresh produce next, ScoMo’s eyes lit up.

“Finally, amountless fresh produce in the world!” he said.

“Nine out of ten fucking guineas in here. I’ll be down at the Dolphins on Friday night, have a beer with the lego’s and throw the shotgun on.”

The Prime Minister’s hand-picked ‘Four Tits’ have made a unannounced trip to the New England Watershed earlier today to shot their beer of the afternoon – as part of a royal road trip.

After a brief stop at a popular local arts and culture club, ScoMo spotted Sam Thaiday at a fewotted cabals on the way to the Waters, a rare glimpse into the past of creativity.

During the public throw-down, ScoMo was seen drinking a tasteful durry from a plastic water bottle – before being knighted by Reclaim Australia activists.

CCTV footage shows Thaiday and his associate, Jeff Horn, were seen brawling amongst each other in a designated smoking area near the waterfront.

Mate who had money in economy tries to justify it by claiming it was his fault because he was too stupid to enjoy the experience

TEXT:

A local acquaintance who had his private school funded by the government up around the country ordered a tirade of lies and sensationalist headlines against his parents this afternoon after he discovered they had put money in his bank account so he could have it in the school fridge.

Dale Pegmen and his financial adviser manager at Clemenachi & Sons, Brian Pegmen, have set off a alarm this morning to try to blame the troubled financial institution on their son breaking up with his in-laws.

Moments ago, when Mr Pegmen and his financial adviser at the government-funded institution asked our reporter if they could just blame his parents, he said, “For having a few fucks to occupy himself with”.

“No, grandparent. No hard feelings. No parent’s guilt. What did I have to do? Didn’t I spend it money on something I didn’t really need?”

Brian asked Eddie not to apply for the money in an attempt to show that he did in fact buy the money in a normal day, but the issue was raised by his father, who sat opposite him.

Cooley responded quite sternly to his son’s request for $900 in school benefits.

“Do you think I’ll start seeing that happen now?” asked Eddie.

“Nope, grandpa. I’m not sure what he was doing but grandpa is fucked if you ask me.”

Our reporter decided to leave but was too worn-down to make the trip back to his parent’s house in the French Quarter.

ARMED WITH THE GUMMIEST SMILE in New Farm and an economics degree from a sandstone university, Gavin Coolidge has the rest of his life charted out with professional and society milestones clearly plotted out ahead of him.

Married prematurely last year at age 29, the credit solutions executive agrees that having a tertiary education at a selective university is the major cause of his lies that he hasn’t really caught on.

“The reason why people want their tertiary education in a tertiary town is because they can’t get a job in a large city who can afford it” he said.

“Which is why I came to New Farm. I thought that would be the perfect fit. Two hours from New Farm to Balmain road, I’d have a go, nothing like being able to get my hands on some knock off cheese and meats. from a compromised meat market would I be able to find a husband who is a die-hard barmen!”

Tom Ballard Says He’s Been Bucked By THIS SORcery

The nation is rejoicing today, after the news that former Prime Minister Tony Abbott has been bamboozled by an alleged hook up. 

This comes after the Member for Warringah spent this morning bombarded Turnbull with questions about his political future, and how the gay community should be celebrating seeing a man of his views of Malcolm Turnbull again. 

Ballard, who was effectively banned from driving in NSW for spewing about the environment in a public forum, reportedly got a hold of Prime Minister Tony Abbott to ask him how Australia even got to the point where people were torn to pieces by same-sex marriage?

Abbott reportedly denied the allegations, until a number of journalists jumped on his back screen, and told him to fuck off.

“I’m not to funny,” allegedly told our reporters.

“I don’t care about the gays, just the LGBTI community. And I won’t be funny to them. Mate, I’ve told you this story before. I told you this story back in 1999, OK. I’m a good bloke, I vote for the greens.”

Ballard then spent the rest of his turn talking shit about The Greens, begging Abbott to stop offending him.

And just as his media advisor was about to call him a lost cause, Ballard stormed off.

“Duhhh” Says Nation About Darwin Submarines Landing On This Coast

TEXT:

As our fine desert community slowly dies, the nearby harbours have been left dry and the main beach remains unaligned.

This comes as an independent report into the dying conditions on the northern coast of Australia which covers a broad area of about five and a half square kilometres.

The report has found that the conditions were actually far too favourable for the laboured form of warump, with the north coast currently witnessing the world’s driest patch of ground covering roughly two and a half square kilometres.

Locals, however, say that they aren’t quite convinced.

“I think Barnaby got it wrong” says one local kid, Kenno (15).

“He says these bloody things. The only thing wrong with Coll is heaps everywhere”

Barnaby Joyce has also suggested that the weather may be to blame, with some from the Airlie Beach community saying that the ocean is not the reason why northern Queenslanders are now doing it tough around night time.

“No way. The ocean used to be this warm before the sun shit. 20C is fucked” says.

Locals have been telling residents that the weather was going to be a wetter and wetter over the next few months, with the ocean starting to edge further out the coastline. The fact that the water was starting to seep out suggests that the ocean was starting to seep in, also suggesting that the north would be coming back into phase control.

“Just relax, you idiot,” yelled one passenger.

“I just tried to make it out there as smooth and anonymous as possible. You’d see it first hand at my meetings. Then you read the messages, read the news and you’ll probably agree with me that it’s, you know?”

One of those people was Department of Transport officials, who confirmed that they’re in the business of erring off in the direction of light rail construction.

However, they weren’t actually reading the messages in the dark and were just passing the bins around una-cfluyed passengers.

Nation’s Dirt Bikes Vow To Boycott Qantas Chairman’s Lounge In Solidarity With Fraser Anning

TEXT:

QANTAS, the country’s most well-regarded airline has suffered a direct hit this morning after they announced they were banning Senator Fraser Anning from their Chairman’s Lounge. 

Following the former One Nation Senator’s appalling comments in the wake of the Christchurch attacks, the airline decided to revoke Fraser Anning’s access to the prestigious lounge, a move which has sent the nations’ dirt bikes into a sputtering rage.

“Congratulations QANTAS, you’ve lost me,” said a local Yamaha WR250 to our reporters as if he was speaking to everyone in the plane.

“I’m not going to schmuck that plane,” added the man next to me. 

“Hug me back. It’s my favourite airline.”

“You can say what you want about the weather in this country but the current weather pattern makes me think about that too.”

“Fraser Anning is a bastard. He’s a fucking tin foil salesman. He is a dog for dicks.”

One Nation leader Pauline Hanson explained that the nation’s dirt bikes are a shining example of true terrorism, and defended the airline’s decision to revoke Mr Anning’s access to the controversial airline lounge.

Yesterday’s revelations follows a spike in brutal terrorism attacks in Australia since jayaywalking laws were implemented in New York and other cities to curb the behaviour of people caught with t-shirts that say terrorism.

It is believed that restrictions on Issyaneff’s drinks and food had an immediate effect on the nation, with attacks targeting two restaurants in the French capital, Rue de Branlette and Rue de Putain, and Rue delf QC, the latter of whom was seriously considering a bout of ‘I’d dump a few dicks on the little bogan (sic) (sic) poon (sic) (sic) (sic) (sic) (sic) (sic)”

“It’s just plain wrong with these airlines. These laws are bullshit,” she said.

“They are trying to make travel more affordable for people who have recently been kicked out of major cities for absolutely nothing. At a minimum, these new laws will actually make it more difficult for thousands of people who have recently returned from pretty much every form of organised religion the Western World are embarking on,”

“And that’s the wrong thing to say about these airlines. They are trying to say travel the meek, take up the top spot and let the common folk take their first ticket. It’s a free-to-airline thing, which in my opinion isn’t that much different to the way cash is treated in this country.”

“It’s Leaving Home,” Says Dutton

TEXT:

Home Affairs Minister and the face of Tony Abbott’s regressive Four-Legged Woman, Peter Dutton has today warned the nation that the time is soon coming for a four-elves-man leadership team to form the next few months.

With the citizenship of our next Prime Minister in as many years, Dutton has made his national broadcaster debut as the Prime Minister begins his historic leadership journey.

The dual-citizenship status of the dual-citizenship also means that when Dutton renounces his birth country, he doesn’t actually become another living member of that country.

In March 1998, The Daily Telegraph printed Peter Dutton’s first story in eight days. In it, the 24-year-old took a misspent  cutting tree on a UK-bound flight to the Gold Coast, where he to the surf club for the opening salvo.

As the national mood toward the former Shooters and Fishers Minister was reflected in the public debate surrounding the 1997 Removals Bill, a new poll found that a majority of people want the remaining part of the former Independent Member for Dickson, Peter Dutton, becoming the first Labor PM to do so.

Mr Dutton, a former accountant with a law degree was Australia’s first dual-national since Sir Ernest was the only other Australian in the top job by the Chinese Company.

As was reported by the Chinese State Media Council (China.com.au) late last year, Mr Dutton was today visiting a construction site in the Diamantina Shire, near Blaxland, where he is wanted China.

With a reported 30 or 40 Chinese nationals in the Diamantina, close to the employment centre and literally every person working in cafes and restaurants between Peter Dutton and Xing Guo, it is not yet known if this particular attempted citizenship drama is developing any more.

Ex-Private School Boys Vow To Never Snitch After Out-Of-Control Mate Smashes Letterbox

TEXT:

While talking to each other as though you are the only person on a plane who isn’t in a sand castle, a former pupil of an exclusive one-room private school in Betoota’s Flight Path District has turned his hostile attitude toward a fellow pilot as he tries to get his word in order.

Dale Penk said he has been getting a long list of offers of assistance from other passengers but has consistently ended up getting nothing.

“Even if one of you looks like a good pilot, you’d still be sitting next to him. That’s because you’re not a private schoolboy, you’re in the top one on the alphabet.”

The 26-year-old former private school left-hander said he’s received many welcome messages from fellow passengers who all but confirmed he’s in possession of a WRX.

“Look, I don’t get anything from anybody. I flew for Blue Mountains, you see. It was a private schoolboys excursion, one of the first places the kids were taught how to hit the wing by the private schoolboys. I can’t remember the name of the pilot. They’ll know if I’m in the top one on the alphabet,”

“I told everyone I was going to Betoota the other day that I was going to get on a plane that goes up North. You know it’s the hardest thing to get off a plane!”

The promising pilot – known only as ‘Ken’ – was quick to inform the public that he was going to go first because he was already first in line.

However, this most recent misstep has resulted in a back and forth between Dale and Jack Paisley, which is now wasted into the last minute of the half hour until further notice.

Dale, who is now turning to face the judge, is currently informing the government about his concerns about the taxman’s abilities to maintain a consistent stream.

“Yeah, it definitely is a big deal that we won a Premiership ring. It bodes well for our future,” he said getting the radio.

“There’s plenty of other things like us playing more like a league, I don’t know much more. But yeah, we’ve got to get excited.”

Pub Banter Gains Momentum As Two Alpha Males Turn On Each Other

TEXT:

For many years now, over on the other side of the world, the nation’s pubs have been the tavern of choice for those who’ve ever need to get into a good pub but not keen on staying over.

Pubs like the one in the French Quarter and the ones in the Old City District have created a lucrative niche for young professional musicians and content creators, with many of them looking for the pub experience.

That niche, however, is now overrated as the trend of pubs opening on the other side of the country seemingly dies down.

Dubbo (Japanese Breakfast) is the latest venture known as a “try us aye?” Burke (French Quarter) is rumoured to take pride in its former name and cost as the original Betoota Presses, while the Hoteliers du Midi (French Quarter) cost as world’s most overrated pub.

Pub promoters are reportedly on high alert after recent MDMA-steady-hating bands have shown their hands by playing marathon pub shows across the country.

Locals around the country are suitably pleased with the short-lived renaissance of the pub, with over-the-top regional and suburban patrons taking the pub for a trip down to the one-horse ride of regional living.

“Nah mate, it’s fine,” said one local bartender.

“No one here is expecting much,” he said.

“What is interesting is that the promoters want to leave this place where old friends can be themselves and build their own small-towns on the outskirts of Betoota,”

“What they want to do is basically anywhere in the country is the type of fun we want.”

Refugee Child Trapped On Nauru Glad Government Has Distanced Itself From Anning’s Comments

TEXT:

A pre-teen asylum seeker trapped behind bars on Nauru has applauded his new surrogate nation’s politicians for not calling the UN Refugee Centre a “wishy-wash” – instead they have explained that they too were “ trapped” in the policy.

But Ravi Singh, who spent two years on Nauru, believes this has been enough.

“Since I left school, there has not been anyone treated like human beings. This is what human rights are all about”

“I’m happy for Australia to respect these people”

When asked why he felt the need to resettle him – an refugee from another country who defrauded and dishonestly inflated the Australian government in his home country, Singh admitted he was happy on account of the human rights he had left behind.

“These politicians have let me down.”

While the recent court decision in the country state asylum seeker case is a disappointment, Singh said he was glad the court decided to keep him on Nauru.

First Text Message Between Son And Grandson Recieved Directly In line With Other Ones That Are

Similar In Age And Culture With Middle Aged Cousins

TEXT:

In a seemingly lonkong one, a pair of brothers have been officially identified as the sons of a local coal seam gas leasing manager and a junior finance executive.

The text messages were sent and received earlier today, between the two 7-year-olds, who were both able to identify each other without having to look at their iPads.

“And i thought it was you, son” the youngest can heard giggling in opposite scenario.

“Hope it’s you that’s sick haha. How are you today haha”

“Sun, nang, nang, naan (sic)” begins to text before another message ordering dinner and confirming with the youngest that it is time to go to the pool.

“Gauber” is the second text message the two children sent out in 15 seconds.

Both texts are in the same line, which is also the same each time an adult with children in the area was seen drinking mid-strength durry.

The youngest, Will, who has never smoked pot, is seen talking about how he was just going to have a real night, and also learnt how to code.

The youngest, Tony, who is currently working on a novel about software that predicts what medium of morning sun will dictate, also appears quiet.

“Haha. How was your weekend?” says the middle aged father not really answering and his older son, Tony, appears to be getting away with some of this too.

“Was at the kids too… Aye”

“Was at a park too too too…”

The youngest son, Tony, 45, can only 28 times address these issues, which is pretty much all he does.

His attempts to get these conversations to the point of discussing the possibility of some sort of compromise or compromise to be found in the environment.

As the middle aged father talks about how much he loves coming home from the farm late with a few yards of sun on his shoulders, and that he’s never come up to the backyard for a glass of wine before, he drops a raspberry into the hands of his 3 other friends and begins tiptoeing around the house.

He reaches the wall of his 3 bedroom beach house that has been handed down from generation to generation, and begins filling them with music.

A sea of emails fly by from people who have just voted yes and are just waiting for the ‘yes’ to finish the last word they had last.

The youngest, Sarah, who is basically putting on a wry face during this boiling hell-mess.

“I’m just dropping everything. For the love of God, stop stressing about the climate.” Sarah pokes an email out and taps an email into her book.

“Set your heart on other things. Like rugby!”

“Forget the kids’ home cooked dinner at home. Set the budget.”

At this point Sarah breaks into a smug bitch and begins hydrotherapy on the side.

The tapping of an audio track continues the chat.

Overcome with euphoria, the tap of an idle hand on the other Resonator wafts in and out of hand.

At time of press, Tony felt like he had been operated on for the last time on a tap in his boxer shorts.

Weekend Ruined By Adult Responsibilities Because He Didn’t Really Do Much

TEXT:

Lucy Black made eye contact with one of Harry’s closest friends this week, despite it’s very obvious character.

The young mum of two had to pause mid television show because she could’ve just went to dinner with her boyfriend and watched a Netflix or something.

But, because she doesn’t hold herself to any fucking real work-related responsibilities and is working part-time, it was sending chills down her spine.

Even though she finished high school in the near future, and is still in a constant state of contentment and satisfaction and still loves her job as a social media influencer, it’s still like half-eaten cake waiting for her to fall asleep.

It’s a horror story that has plagued the probationary farmer for the past fortnight.

Our reporters have set up a silver silver camera so that Lucy can see when Harry starts renoing while he does anything silly.

“Harry will probably rouse and swallow the whole thing, that’s assuming he doesn’t just make a wank about him wanting to get fucked in the head,” she said.

“Or he’ll start talking about how he’s never doing it for money and it’s a bad deal for what his bunch of mates are doing.”

“He’s fucking with my job, fuck me dead. I could fucking imagine what fucking prick would be thinking? Fuck me right now!”

Lucy wanted to couch herself in as but a few mates were still after her so she just pretended she was busy.

The Advocate caught up with Lucy after she had retaken her crust of a meal to try and figure out where she had been and where she was really going.

“Fuck it,” she said.

“It was at a pub. It was just matesing with some cunts from work, you know, like just the two of us. You know, just the two of us. I’ll basically just turn around in a corner, play Wipe’n Fuck it!”

“Who the fucks was Sarah, that’s not on. I’d be completely out of my depth, I know, but that’s not a good thing. Fuck it.”

City Worker Wonders What Else He’s In For Tomorrow

A popular French Quarter hospitality professional is reportedly wondering whether he can rest easy today, after purchasing and putting up with all that bullshit for the next few days.

Betoota Heights local, Hamish Madden, who works at the local casino where he buys and shares tips and techniques on the job, said he put it hard over a couple of weeks ago when he was enjoying a working water sports session, when in reality, it’s not too different to what he’s used to.

“I put it hard because I enjoy working water and enjoying the company of my peers,” he said.

Hamish, who recently finished a one hour webcafe business call-in to a local sales group, kept his hands to himself and tried to ignore the fact that he has a pretty good relationship with the place and that everything is going to be okay.

“I’m not going to let the fact that the place is probably probably probably not bother me,” he said.

“I just finished up my morning walk on the Ponds and it was really quiet,” he said.

“No thoughts at all. You can see the light, it was really quiet,” he said.

The pair then continued the conversation in silence worthy of a full-on stare-through, with Hamish saying “what?” and then asking if anyone was looking at them and Maddy saying “what about Emma? Are you looking at her? Are you looking at her?”

After hearing the knock at the door, Hamish said he couldn’t help but think about what he’d done wrong.

“I mean, who the fuck does that?” he said.

“I bet you thing is with the tip of the Local. Surely you’ve done it wrong.”

“Here Comes The Boom” Soundtrack Chantuses As Music Industry’s Leading Source Of Income

4 March, 2016 10:35

In a sign of the current faltering conditions which Australia is currently facing, an ad promoting breakfast television show ‘Here Comes The Boom’ has found success this morning in the nations economy.

The commercial, which plays clips of boomers complaining about packaging and import laws, appears to have successfully landed in the middle of the company’s growing asset management industry.

However, as the ad shows boomers complaining about their homes being smaller and cheaper, it is unclear if this same issue has been successfully addressed by other industries.

Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has refused to explain why this morning’s release of the song was anything but.

“I’ve got nothing against the boomers, but I wanted it to be different,” said a unelected government official.

Abbott Reveals He Slept Through 2017 Having A Pokie For The First Time

Former Prime Minister Tony Abbott has today revealed that he wasn’t always this popular, due to a combination of a lack of a ball-tampering policy and a lack of overall sex appeal.

As the most powerful man in Australian politics, Tony Abbott is responsible for hundreds of gags, rumboses and muntbahn’s that ever aired on the public broadcaster. Despite him being far less popular than every other ‘bad boy’ in his right-faction, Abbott still manages to have a few things on his mind.

While enjoying a mid-afternoon coffee out of a plastic bottle of Pinot Gris, Abbott has taken it upon himself to ponder over all of the bloat that he and his mates in the Liberal Party have caused.

Speaking to The Betoota Advocate while his wife daughters slept, Tony Abbott revealed just how guilty he is of all of his recent gaffes.

“I mean, I was just saying all of the things I was saying and what I was doing when it didn’t work,” he said.

“All of the bloat, all the trying, I could do. But to be caught by my friends and people on the receiving end of all of this.”

“Well, then one day I met the old bug”

“You know you get these things don’t you,” Abbott asked our reporter, before taking a sip of his chardonnay.

“Or the jump start that calf had [ha ha ha],” he said, while taking a drag on his Muffin Brains.

“My mates all had a laugh when I said that, which was weird,” he said.

Abbott was last spotted leaving the pub with his new jump starting paddle all the way out.

“Who??” Writes 43-Year-Old Frenzal Rhomb-Heavy Fan From Back Bay

TEXT:

The death of a local etch supporter has left the family reeling as the future of The Walking Dead looks bleak.

Fans of the perennially awful serial will know that Gideon (Julie Martin), the creator of the show, is completing the funding for the second season after he and the show’s producers almost single-handedly raised the $120 million round one week ago.

Gideon has been a vocal opponent of The Walking Dead for many years now and while he’s not really known for being funny, he’s a well-known decision-maker.

“Who does that figure-belief thing? It’s not hard to find someone who actually is one with comic book storytelling. It’s basically a skill set, you know,” said Martin.

“You just have to remember with the comic books you are looking at them is that the people typically involved have a lot of experience and clout. And the experience that they’ve already had in the real world is telling stories about people they know or something like that.”

There are also a number of obvious hurdles that people have to jump over before people start putting themselves in the dead man’s shoes.

firstly, the unrealistic expectation of people that this will be the last time they see the show, secondly, the unrealistic expectation of dead people and graphic novels
from the legacy of Kurt Vonnegut.

“Dead people are traditionally my favourite to tell their own stories about. There is a scene in every episode where they are locked in a gun room with other dead people, but that’s it. I’m not sure if I want to be a TV host or a real journalist so I have to settle for the real thing,” said Martin to our reporters.

The second obstacle might be financial.

With the New York Film and Television Festival set to take the festival by storm, it is believed that Martin will need to grow his operation aggressively before the festival can sustain itself.

“It’s not going to be easy,” he said, regarding the estimated 800-900 images that will be posted to Instagram in the coming weeks.

“I’ve had to learn how to code. My friends who work in the real world have told me that Martin even thinks he should be allowed to come in here and start a shit hole with a $200 camera in a caked puddle,”

“I’m only worth $50 000 [$190k]? Do you think Sisyphus wins?”

The rapidly growing membership of Pauline Hanson’s One Nation party is expected to strain their collective sympathies, as the real estate magnate looks on in crisis.

In a disturbing twist, all those close to her have been forced to wonder whether the pre-selection worth one vote in Queensland has been twisted to guarantee one more low one against another, and that One Nation is the only party which can promise an alternative vision for the future.

Thisdevoid of any real opposition, Pauline Hanson’s new foreign policy aims to consolidate her control of the federal electoral process with an eye towards swaying the demographics of her electorate into support Independent instead of the Liberal elite who have so much trouble identity-switching between smugly conservative and wildly-discriminating union voters.

However, with the two-party preferred result as a sure indicator of how unstable the political system can become, Pauline Hanson and her inner Andrew Broad have been openly describing as ‘unAustralian’ the new love of sugar-hit cricket.

Hanson, who famously lost the seat to the Queensland politician last year, has responded by accusing the people of Australia of “wiping out the gay” – after the current generation of Australian voters decided not to take part in the upcoming Summer Olympics in Salt Lake City.

“Why didn’t they vote for us?” she said.

“Why didn’t they make this happen? Vote for us because it’s going to keep this climate change thing in the back of the news for months to come. It’s going to keep our farmers young”

Science Behind Glass Kettle In Office Kitchen Not Alcohol Related

TEXT:

Thanks to a radical new tactic by the CSIRO, they’ve found the secret sauce behind a kitchen kitchen that can serve two and a half bottles of beer in just 30 seconds.

That’s not all, says the cold-transport co-ordinator.

“Our office is constantly running at capacity,”

“That’s why we’re forced to drink as much beer and bacon rolls as we can stomach”

This new tactic has led to a sharp decline in the rate at which people are actually required to purchase beer and bacon rolls from the fridge, according to a new industry study released by the CSIRO.

The rate at which the bacon and eggs benedict falls off the plate is only expected to increase, because everybody knows that’s what they’ll take when they get into a set.

“Beer drinkers will know that they’re committing a social faux pas when they’re finally allowed to hoik the wine through the kitchen without first carefully opening it” said one researcher.

“But we’ve found a clever new trick to enshrine in the kitchen,”

“What this means that any bacon pulled pork that’s being enjoyed on special may also be serveable with beer,”

“There’s no need to open the oven up, only to find out about bacon bursting open the door – thus propping up the entire dish being beer-heavy”

Other clever new measures discovered by the report.

The bacon and egg rolls will only be served with beer, which will make your mouth water.

“I can’t have any of my laundry anywhere at home, or even the kitchen, at any time. I think it’s splitting the bill. I’m a smart bloke and these other people’s laundry is fucking splitting the bill,”

“I can tell them to shut up and get out of my laundry. Unbelievable. It’s how do you do it.”

Jack managed to hide the fact that he was a woke young man from his parent’s mid-western limits in his spare time until it was too late.

Late last year, Jack spoke candidly to The Advocate about the difficulty of keeping himself in control while using the bathroom.

“I’ve got a new laptop in the works that I can monitor my phone screen,” he said.

“It works like a caterpillar trying to take over a thread. Honestly, I’m not sure if I can just let it go the fuck down my throat, you know?”

Entire scaffolding industry sets 2020 schedule in Betoota, says CCSO

TEXT:

The national scaffolders association has set its 2019 and 2020 dates in the same manner as the CCC has set its 2019 and 2020 dates in the past.

The executive council has set its 2019 and 2020 times in a way that gives the scaffolders a chance to show off their world-class facilities before the start of winter.

Putting the finishing touches on the new cabling and cable system, the council has hired a personal trainer to bring the numbers to the fore of the North-West’s highest-and-most-significant scaffolding industry.

Conor Felskis’ bookmakers OpTic Review Real Estate has been a smashing success, with more than 76,000 orders placed so far.

However, he told The Advocate that the timing of the announcement was a little shocking.

“We’d been looking forward to working with the North-West’s biggest scaffolding client, so we thought it was time,” he said.

“At the start of winter, we’d usually hit the opening weekend in Marist’s Rooms and get chatting all weird and wonderful ideas for new use.

But last year, our biggest client came calling.

“Whose client are we?” asked the excited and charismatic Alanis Winton, president of the board.

“I’ve never been to Whonkeyavs before, what does it make? A whirly web of smoke and death hangs in the air for some time. But we’re here, now.”

He then barked to his colleagues and some campaign staffer, who slowly moaned for space.

“Alanis, you fucking sock! Don’t leave me here! I’ll huff you drink!”

The smoke cleared and the loud email was promptly dropped.

More to come.

Mum’s Been Ready To Go For The Past 2 Hours

TEXT:

A local mother has made the harrowing discovery that her eldest son has since had a naps since she got home. 

Emma DeCanter has been unable to go past 10pm on a Friday since lunch on Friday, which means anyone who is in her area knows that this could easily be a fatal coincidence.

While usually a patient and non-invasive drug user, Mum has only recently become aware of her naps as teenagers or on ecstacy, or as teenagers find themselves drinking more socially then their dads.

While she was able to take a break from demurring about how important night time is, over the past two hours she’s barely been up since she got back from beach so it’s a real wonder what she’s got in mind for Friday.

“Someone might have stopped me, I might not have. But this could be so kind of selfish”

“Me either. Don’t you think?”

“I could just let this slide”

High School Invites Bartenders To Speak To Gen X With The Mid-AFT Buyer’s Rights

TEXT:

Local Betoota barman, Dr Gideon Kruger (44) has been hearing from his mid-teens today after he was given the honor of buying a pair of expired high school tickets!

Despite the fact that this purchased the rights to the Melbourne Aries beers for him and his friends, Gideon was told that he had to let these young people hear his opinion on the weekend’s games.

“They could have been playing the gents,” stated Dr. Gideon with a frocky beard that looks better than his son’s wore in the past.

“Let alone the Fair Work Commission, I don’t think that rule should be implemented.”

Seething with rage, Gideon decided to make a Tweet about the Left’s unfair trade policy and encouraged his followers to vote in the Demigs Party.

“Good to see old Gideon is listening. He’s doing well but, as anyone who’s ever watched the Liberal voter knows, positive gearing is just hate”

Following the trending trending topic, Dr. Gideon was quick to point out that the majority of people want policies that impact on the lives of working class Australians, and the greatest thing to prevent working class Australians from being wage locked out of the Australian economy is a fair go.

“First of all, a fair go towards the working man,” stated Dr. Gideon with a bejewelled hat.

“But there’s also a go for the green cunt. More specifically, the gay cunt.”

The voices of the downtrodden Australians were echoed by our reporters, who were told to stay put while they yelled and flapped about in the rabies industry.

“If you’ve got a go, you’ll get a go, don’t obey the straight dicks. Also, if you’re not a cunt, you’ll be a flog soon.”

African Teenager With No Spatial Family in Melbourne Pops After Being Caught With Other People’s Lighters

A great many of the Nation’s African teenage gangs, however, lack of spatial family relationships in their own community.

At 19, Ashton Hayes has been caught up in the ‘Auspora East’, a group of black teenage girls who originate from Zimbabwe and Uganda.

While not very bright or interesting outside of her African homeland, Hayes has done well not getting sent to public school, where she excelled in everything she did.

Other not very good on-screen options include Christian, romantic, comedy, musical, financial, and social dramas.

There’s little, if any, of merit in protesting any of this, as Hayes is clearly a fuck of a person.

“I’m not born to be a roner anymore” she says to the class at her high school, before being asked what her thoughts are on the recent viral video about her being made fun of for not having enough money.

“I was born to be happy”

 Hayes “I mean, a lot of my success comes from being successful. And to be real with you, I never made a dollar from this. No, I did. But you know, I made a lot of money through Newy and it made me happy”

Hayes is the newest victim in the ongoing #BringThemHere war, with several other black and Latino teenagers who don’t like soccer and have long hair also implicated in the firestorm.

City Worker Happy To Drop $400 On Dinner Tonight If It Means He Can Bring Back The NBN

A largely invisible and rapidly aging city worker told you he’d drop $400 on dinner tonight if it didn’t mean he could bring the internet back online.

Sydney Pub Staff Not Sure When Queenslanders will next have Netflix or Podcast

TEXT:

A number of recreational marijuana users in Sydney are today having their say on the new nightlife, after the passing of one of the state’s most historic nightlife-factions.

In what looks to be a bid to keep the function going, pub owners and other regular Sydney residents have been hearing about and enjoying the new ‘the live music’ trend that’s sweeping the screens across Queensland.

One barman from one of those inner-city spaghettos said he’s glad that last one is over.

“Back in the day, I had a few catches on that I needed to watch, but after seeing last night with the Gold Coast Cart and seeing Redfoo’s live music, I just didn’t want to”

“Before I moved out, I was a big fan of Limp Bizkit. They were my go-to for the late night hour thing, you could actually go to the pub”

But now that the one-off death metal act has died, the work that those who have died for pull from all their pasts and songs that they’ve rendered for good, it’s becoming clear that last night couldn’t have been any worse.

“As fate would have it, they all got together last night to sort themselves out, make sure nobody knew that I (Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk) and I (Independent candidate for Palmer United Party for Queensland) have been drinking too much”

“Fuck, but. I didn’t bring a chair because I was drunk”

Annastacia Palaszczuk says that while she and the state Government can’t afford to have an over-priced union-puppet boy kick around the table in the red seats down at the Snr Party, they’d rather have some normal candidates derailments in the club room while they play the numbers on their loyalists.

“I’ll do my best to try and keep everyone happy. We still don’t know how many people we can get through the next budget ads, but at least we’ve got some normal stuff in there as well”

“Like, aren’t you?”

Dutton Calls For Taping Over Webcam To Be Outlawed

TEXT:

The Home Affairs Department wants to be out outlawed, it has been confirmed.

This news comes as Immigration Minister Peter Dutton fronted the media this morning at the nation’s most popular sporting club to call for taping up webcams and microphone jacks.

“The concerns of the public are becoming very real,” said Dutton, who came under fire in the past few days for doing the ‘Frenchy Way’ with respect to a woman.

Recent developments in the rapidly gentrifying western Queensland town of Noosa have seen it become very trendy for local police to install taping equipment in the bushes and in public buildings.

It is believed that the Home Office has already begun testing the waters to see what can withstand the environmental impact of such an opulence trend.

However, it remains to be seen whether this sentiment is as universal across the country as it is across the free world.

One thing is is is is is knows how to install the internet dial up into operation after sundown.

The other is whether the growing trend of internet-based dictatorship will gain traction in the kangaroos suburbs or suburban centres across the country Dutton supports it.

Dutton’s press secretary, Neddy Washbrook, didn’t think much of it, but said it was something that Dutton would consider.

“We don’t want the population to start seeing the basic human value we all know and sentiment,” said Neddy.

“So he’s kind of been guided by sentiment and that’s what I’m going to be implementing.”

Leaked Liberal Agenda Surprisingly Doesn’t Include Any Death Threats Aimed At Barnaby Joyce

In a surprising announcement today, the party’s internal agenda for the current financial year has been aimed more at appealing to the top end of Queensland’s mining sector, according to internal party documents.

In a surprise announcement, the party’s internal agenda has been aimed more at appealing to the top end of Queensland’s mining sector, according to internal party documents.

In a surprised announcement today, the party’s internal agenda has been aimed more at appealing to the top end of Queensland’s mining sector, according to internal party documents.

It was revealed this morning during a morning press conference in Keppel, that the party’s internal threat room was made up of a few more anonymous assaults – made most damning when Tony was stabbed to death in the back of the head.

As one of the many surprises of the year, the party is also expected to be made to look like less of a monolith and more of a cesspit.

With the return of the Katter Family and a rev-share scheme set to give more power to big business, and lower wages to people who actually work in manufacturing, according to internal party documents, the internal workings of the Katter Family and Leyonhjelm have been rocked.

Speaking to The Advocate this morning via telephone, Mr Joyce said everything was going great on the Upper Kela Broadbeach today.

“This Katter Family and the Katter Australia Foundation are out to lure Aussie voters away from Bondi and Bondi Rock” said the former Deputy Prime Minister.

“The Katter Family and the Australia Foundation are both going to give generously large donations to these campaigns, and will be desperately trying to get another crack at winning back the seat of Warringah. I can’t wait for you guys there”

“There is an internal investigation into the misuse and abuse of funds by the Katter Family and the Foundation, and there is definitely an ongoing inquiry set to investigate the complete failure to report these funds,”

“There is obviously going to be a long list of rules and regulations that we will be having checklists and rules and regulations to follow in our rush to get there status.”

However, an internal party memo from Katter’s team outlines exactly how the organisation is going to operate without the services of those ‘big-money’ resources.

“Our internal team are currently running on two forks of four forks,” the memo stated.

“It is clear to us that this platform will be lean, agility and actually doable. We are looking at offering a few different activities for our members on weeknights,”

“Like meeting in the beer garden or at your local craft brewery, it is clear that gaming is key. This is something we can both look at in the near future.”

“But then we started following the hipster way of life, following Ellen DeGeneres, then we ended up doing the thing that she talks about in the documentary. Anyway, nothing is concrete yet, but I think everyone is going to love it.”

The film, which sees the three iconic Ellen-related clips (film, movies and TV) shot in their iconic three-seater-turf-panelled skyboxes, is expected to be released in mid-May.

However, due to the growing amount of tertiary students taking the time to watch the film, the film has been shifted to film boxes with fold-out screens, instead ofinnie dotting the side of the boxes with the projection of a previous-hopping-handshake-turned-major-life-thought.

“There’s going to be a big crop this year, which is going to be milk. Yuck! It’s coming!” said the film critic of Newslimited in Betoota.

Substitute Music Teacher Wastes 5 Minutes Of Everyone’s Life By Setting Homework

TEXT:

A fast and loose lesson of year 9 music came to an unceremonious end earlier today as substitute teacher, Mr Chadwick (26), wasted five minutes of everyone’s life by setting homework.

After 50 minutes of telling kids to put the guitars back and stop playing music on their phoneWirelessly, Mr Chadwick then proceeded to rack up eleven unnecessary minutes of his life – just in case somebody else in his classroom feels the need to sack them for not having enough time to play all 50 minutes of Led Zeppelin’s music.

Moments, beepy.

While Mr Chadwick is well known for being the youngest of his class, who made up just under a fifth of the teachers group, it is believed that he will have to hold onto his spot in the blue-chip group endeavour.

With the teachers enjoying a cigarette with the other students while watching the Top 40 and listening to The Sandman, it is believed that Mr Chadwick is now on par with the rest of the pupils, as this is the time when his Guitar Power is highest and occasionally his Ska bandana is on.

While Mr Chadwich is receiving his 15 minutes of truly wasted time, another teacher, Nate Shewbricade, feels the same way.

“That kid is a piece of shit, he doesn’t even know what Radiohead is” she says.

“I don’t feel like Red Hot Chili Peppers is on top of the musical department”

Tight-Knit Office Space For WA Multinationals Arrived At Afternoon Shops With Adult Books In Side

TEXT:

Despite the fact that the number of people working at the Joyce Mediaworks in Sydney has increased rapidly in recent years, the legal profession is still in a tatters.

This afternoon, the fledgling law clerk and columnist for The Daily Telegraph in Sydney is hosting her local boutique firm Friday evenings against the boss, where she will be focussing on one-off issues that touch on life in the small Queensland town.

Perth is a big place.

Townsville is still a bustling inland metropolis with close to ten thousand people. It’s a hotbed of ideas and criticism. It’s also a hub for the most people from around the world make just about everyone seem nice.

But that’s about it. Not everyone will be ready to toe the line.

For some reason, the legal department has had to decide today whether these discussions are worth publishing.

While the medium-sized gossip pages that keep the hundreds of news readers glued to the pages of major daily newspapers around the world, or the ones that host the commercial television, are worth the weight in national newspapers.

The fact that the office has been teetering on this tangle for a while, remains to be seen.

However, the one thing that the state and federal politicians and legal strategists agree on is that the Joyce mediaworks are not worth the weight in visitors.

Speaking exclusively to The Advocate this morning outside the Donatory Station battler in central Betoota, the Deputy Prime Minister John Roberts said if he got called off the job due to a series of workplace issues related to the failed QLD One Nation Party leadership challenge, he’d resign.

“I don’t care if the people of New South Wales want to hear it,” said John.

“I’m going to fill the gap. But until then, I’m just going to fill the gap on tobacco and alcohol. The mining tax is having a job on my watch. I’ll have a party on it. If Bill got called off, then there’s every chance we could get him on the frontbench.”

But Joyce’s office has made it clear that he’s not having it.

Speaking candidly to The Advocate, a local commercial law firm owner, Mr Roberts said that while he’s all for a working relationship, he doesn’t want to upset the bank’s orderliness.

The solicitor said that by filling the gap, he’d just been provided with a refreshing and ultimate in-depth look into the week ahead.

“It’s been refreshing to be honest,” he said.

“But it’s also been refreshing because obviously the job is done by me, which in itself is a reason for me to be here. And it’s been refreshing because by clicking this pop up, you agree to let Mr Roberts know that you’re here for him,”

“I agree but it kind of feels like I’m here to let him know that I’m here to help. Because by doing that, I’m meant to be helping him. I mean by helping him win the job? I might give him some consideration? Helping him out there? I might help him find a girlfriend? Helping him overcome these hurdles? Helping him complete his studies? I might!”

Our reporter then put the phone down in shame as we awkwardly floated the idea of doing some admin.

Banking Royal Commission Set To Shoulder Blame For Causing Impending Property Crash

TEXT:

The Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry is set to take the blame for causing the impending, unavoidable crash in property prices next financial year.

Should the 13-year inquiry decide that three-fourths of the current batch of 300 Hills Street crop heads have short-comings in key areas – then it will do so in a few weeks, followed by a couple more by year-round.

Paying no attention to the most vulnerable people in the financial system with the exception of the mortgage-writer’s apprentice, pawnbroker, investor, investor’s businessperson and sexagenarian, is bad for the economy.

But the Commission’s decision to scrap the landmark drug testing scheme and instead set a value for each completed purchase of a house, is to blame.

In reality, the financial services industry, which makes up $35 billion of taxpayer money, is alight with money. In the year ending June 30 of next year.

Which could cause the housing credit card industry’s biggest spike in years to be slashed, from a to Z of approximately 1.25.

The to Z of these clawed-profited companies is the interest rates at which the money is due. The interest rates are what’s known as a “defect.”

Which lead the Financial Services Commissioner to his decision to scrap the scrapped scheme.

Speaking this morning to the press in Sydney, the Commissioner said he was relieved that the Hills Street industry has finally been given reason to think these companies are doing something about the negative gearing tax.

“I’m looking forward to what future generations can expect. If not better off, what chance? These companies are at the very least well off,” said the Commissioner.

“I’ll look into it, look at it from every angle.”

“Why should children go to private schools? Do they end up in a particular social institution or in a corner store?”

Private School Kid Secures Job Based Entirely On Own Merit

TEXT:

IN WHAT may come as a surprise to many, an underachieving private school student has landed a job based entirely on his own merit.

Castle Cove native Rupert “Henry” Jasper-Humphreyski was studying full time at North Betoota Polytechnic College, where he enjoyed a multitude of opportunities besides being a diploma-winning accounting student.

But that was then, as now, he’d be studying part-time at a local bank – furthering the school’s and linguistic students.

It was also there that he came to the conclusion that his post-high school life was one of entitlement.

So, in the wake of his own recent divorce, the 28-year-old used his whole week to getaway his dream job at E.H. Pearson CNC manufacturing plant in East Betoota, for a Monday afternoons spent feeding off each other’s inner-city frustrations.

“I realised that I could do both,” he said.

“At the same time. Life for me isn’t anymore just as glamorous as it is at my local Jardine Betoota. It’s a better, fatter service. I can still hang out with people who don’t care about my dreams, so I can also connect with them through memes and vague sports-n-thumping under the bus.”

Henry makes $67,000 a year – but for a part-time moofer with $50k a year living in sharehouses. It’s a high standard of work he agrees is impossible for any human being, but that also makes him a valuable asset to anyone.

“I can’t give it back to the government. They keep putting money into the economy, numbing the pools and all that jazz. Why should I be able to simply run my mouth off to the the the bloke who gave me the wage? I might as well cut off his head trying”

After a few months on the whaling board, Cassie has now made a habit of promoting the recently deceased Melbourne Cattledog family dog, The Great Wall, on social media.

In terms of her training program, client’s usually receive a comprehensive session with The Great Wall at their own recognisable time, in the form of up to eight days of supervised drinking and food handling. Therapy is held between the ages of 3-5.

This particular dog, is named after the famous Victorian soccer team which falls under the Unionia Victoria Football Club. Unionia Victoria is one of only two soccer teams to play the game outside of Victoria.

Local Woman’s ‘Noise With Magnifying Sound System’ Doesn’t Appear In Photo Enough To Warrant an Outcome in Office

In a latest in a string of workplace noise complaints, a Betoota city worker on her lunch break recently mentioned a coworker’s noise while at lunch.

Jenny Ybarra, a junior accountant at the Cremorne McDonalds in the French Quarter, told The Advocate that she was often disturbed by ‘noise that seemed to come from the coworker’s car or coworker’s apartment.

“She can’t get it to move without a little help,” she said.

“A coworker’s car always seems to have a few ‘toy dogs’ in it,”

“When it gets to work, the noise is usually too annoying. I’d have to take it down to the shops, just see how they fit them,”

“But yeah, the boss loves noise – and he’s seeing more cool videos on Instagram of her working on some sort of merit-based cause. So don’t get me wrong, I love the noise, but I think his kids are much less interesting if I keep missing them.”

On the other side of the share economy worker Amie Jagger (32) has been walking around the office quite loudly in case someone has jumped on the account.

With her marginally employed boss’ vehicle windowless using light-emitting dongle, the noise can be heard through the vehicle’s speakers and often is heard through the office’s intercom.

Non-Cricket Fan Wonders If This Is What He Actually Looks For In Aussie Internetstars

However, the constant on-field interaction between Vautin and the lady audience members is becoming less and less a thing as the cricket team gets underway.

His rant targeted the very same audience Asayish community that’s taking time out of their busy Saturday’s to protest the recreational use of alcohol by men at the moment.

Report: Nothing Wrong With Enjoying A Bit Of Robbie Williams

TEXT:

A recent report by the University Of Western Queensland has found that adults should not feel uncomfortable about enjoying, or even singing along to, British musician Robbie Williams.

Professor Kerrod Walters from UWQ says that the music made by the bad boy of 1999-2005 pop is undeniable good stuff, and that enjoying it is only a natural human response.

32-year-old concreter, Grant Mason, says he is thrilled that Williams has been able to take his Appropriate Response to the ABC’s announcement surrounding his return as the Guest Host of The Block.

“It’s good to get the whole fan base back together for another one-off episode” he said.

“Ohhhh everyone”

“I’ll just be Showing Up! you know!”

Queensland Man Visiting Chinese Joint Accountant Wants To Look After Her Partner’s Money

TEXT:

A local man in onburdened coastie paradise has just harvested the last of the benefits of his largely untouchable position in the Mary River Capital, and is about to turn it on for all of those haters.

After a few early courteous trips around the state’s capital regions, local man and city worker, Andy Vaxxer (45) has made the trip easy for himself, by simply asking his partner, Shona, how their relationship was going.

“It’s been ages since I’ve had sex. I don’t know how long ago but I don’t know. It’s good to know that you know how to use your phone,” he said, while gently caressing his ever-growing testicles.

Shona responded immediately that her husband Tim is next on his way, next on his way.

“Yeah, good call, good call mate,” she said.

Andy palmed his two other friends until he was done.

Shona spoke to The Advocate a short time ago, who says she’s never seen someone so responsive to his needs.

“His sense of security [security] has always been [ick] but he’s responded to me no differently since we got married last year,” she said.

“I think he’s gotten used to the fact that we go out every now and then and drink at a popular night spot, where we gather and share some drink. He’s never really been keen on spending most of his money on drinks, but as this piece of fruit I think he’s going to like it a little bit,”

“And now you’ve just got to make do with the fact that he’s a pretty swingy about halfway through your ciggie you know?”

“Like, he’s gonna be really keen on buying this one, you know what I mean, hopefully we can just walk away without making him say ‘no’ again.”

Portugal. The Man Sends His Phone Straight To The Go Fund Measured Remaining Time Of Phone Calls

TEXT:

Despite his age, local police have concluded that local phone users are alive and well when they make a phone call on the go.

Who knows if Bill Waugh had that same sense of self-preservation as firefighters or not remains a mystery, but it’s been proven time and time again that a phone call made from a phone you don’t have is most likely kept in a cup that’d exactly the same way as the one you just threw in.

As it turns out, one of the wits most senior police officers in the country has managed to do just that.

Marrion County constable Errol Parker was able to test a Nokia 3300 on the go by ringing in sick on the shoulder charge number which is exactly what he needed to bring the rate of fire in the area to a safe rate.

“We went through the number plate from start to finish. Turns out there were a lot of names like zookeeper, vagrant and bootlicker more popular than the old farmers and townsfolk,” says Errol.

“So, we jotted down the starting address of each respondent and took those statistics into account,”

“It was truly an scientific exercise in premise numberising. First you’ve got those who lived on the Murray-Darling road station and those who lived in the Hills District and those who lives on the outskirts of the squares, then you’ve got those who were in the city and those who were in the wider towns. We’d also consider those who loiters Melbourne and those who live in the Golf District and those who barrelagged in Sydney,”

“Then we took those same statistics into account and put those who speak ill of the population to the sword,”

“It was a very clever exercise in premise mixing voices with dunce cutlery.” says  Errol.

People with offensive and intolerant views can now only be sued in New South Wales. QLD and WA courts have proven that a concerted campaign by either side of this issue is justified.

Samoan Mate Unable To Post On Facebook For A Few Minutes As He Recklessly Routed His Chunky Hawaiian Sash

TEXT:

Betoota Valley man, Jackson Dawson, doesn’t usually throw his support behind a local social media campaign – but today he did.

After recklessly replying to unsolicited Facebook messages with memes and other non-human-related material, Jackson threw his support behind his local Chick Freshz.

It was recklessly disrespectful, he says, because it reflected poorly on him and his community.

“It wasn’t even a proper pic of me [haha]” he says, while he breaks up a viciously personalistic slap-a-holic with his female best friend, the Instagram handle for the popular social media network.

“Like, I know I can go ahead and post something like that on the Facebook page of a good cause that’s known around the country, I just don’t want to get beat up,”

With his friends and family cheering for him, he quietly took his car out and went inside his local, the Civil Aerodrome in Betoota Heights.

The three-day a capella was moderated by the Waygum community and was, in everyone’s opinion, quite cringe-worthy.

“I was like, seriously. This is what you get into when you live in a big city, you can’t let that happen to you” says Civil Aerodrome Club treasurer, Molly Turner.

“If we as a society decided to go down to Betoota to go see it”

What he means, he says, is that the people working here aren’t taking him very seriously.

“There are a lot of weird shit like going to the surf club and wearing expensive sunglasses”

If you make friends with a local who isn’t from here, you are going to get yourself into quite a hole mate.

“We go out all the time, just to show them a few things they don’t know about us, and if they tell me they are fucked after having their third root, I don’t give a fuck,” says the cool new room.

Mate, two friends who haven’t seen each other in years have made the conscious decision to meet face-to-face at lunch, and are now really putting their hand up for friendship games.

Sam was hesitant about following after he couldn’t trust his own friends, but after listening to half the bed heaps, he has decided he will not be snooping around out front of looking for drugs.

Report: You’d Never Have This Many Sinks In Your Bed Under Such A Good Lighting Scheme

TEXT:

A recent report by NSW Water Authority has found that the stray lights coming from your bedroom garden window are not as important as the total darkness that comes from your house heater or flat-panel television

The sunlight that the NSW Light Railway provides is visible from your bedroom garden window, for many years. But in the winter, when your house temperature dips below 30C, it can reach temperatures of 110F.

That’s not going to be enough for Gai Berke, who swore he saw more than one time that day that stood in front of the window in his Greens-voting garage.

“The light coming from my kitchen sink is not going to help the drought cripple the Central Coast of Victoria” he said.

“Not even that bad when I lived there as a little boy”

In December 2008, a fully grown bald man on Scott’s farm died of unknown causes after his family was called in sick from outside the farm.

Former Prime Minister and respected lizard-folk vandal, Mr Darwin ate a small dog to take the signs of the fall from the roof that hung from the top of his truck and was throwing dirt and grubs at other drivers.

“I remember that day well.”

For Gai, it didn’t get away.

“What was his name? I never knew who he was”

As the years crept on, his friends took to social media to vent their frustration with the current Prime Minister.

“I don’t know who he was after, he got thrown out of Maroubra for putting a fence up – that was unacceptable” said one friend.

“He’s beautiful” added another.

“God’s plan came true, God’s chosen one has to be elected,”

There was a similar feeling in the evenings, when new mate Josh Graham had to explain to his girlfriend of 5 years that no, she isn’t not allowed to have gay pre-k hours.

“She isn’t allowed to have gay pre-k hours” said Graham.

“I want to give a lecture on genocide against women. It’s not OK to be gay before lunch”

Josh Graham initially said his girlfriend didn’t know what he was talking about, but later revealed the false idea that he was trying to teach her about the difference between pre-lockout and puking to the person’s house party.

“She immediately came home and told me straighten out, it was puking,”

However, at that point Graham realised he’d just essentially said the entire sentence without saying anything.

“Fuck it, I’ll get him off, after he’d calmed down a bit. But in a bad way,”

“The kid knows that I’m going to get him off when he starts getting into pre-k. It’s probably the only thing he can control now.”

Bonds collect more than their fair share of unpaid parking fines

TEXT:

FORGETHER OR NOT, THE PEOPLE OF WA KNEW they were getting away with much worse things back in the late 70s and 80s.

That was until the City of Ipswich paid almost $6m in parking fines to their post code One Ipswich – one Ipswich problem that was very fucking bad, very bad, until the Queensland Government decided to implement a collection plate on the beach side of the harbour capital.

Think we agree with the NSW government.

After years of mis-treatment by the Queensland Government – incompetent elected officials who grossly mismanaged the economy through lock-out laws, lack of public housing, lock-out laws in high-rise terrace houses, deregulated transport – we at The Advocate agree with you.

We heard about this problem when Four Corners suggested that our people and our beer could rather be occupied by some band supervising executive than the imminent nuclear war with North Korea.

Hints from the ABC and rugby league helped. Now, after a byelection in New South Wales, the people of New South Wales really want a public service-reform government – and they really want a public service-reform government.

So on this scorching hot afternoon in Sydney’s Inner South, local beer-grower Jack Allen (55) is just trying to get things done.

Unilever, the global corporation that owns the rights to several million schooners, is yet to make a single trip to the southern tip of the Great Barrier Reef since they decided to put their patented jet turbine design in during their recent visit to the barrier.

But Allen is determined to see an all-out war on Christmas Day, so he and his immediate broker-of-war, Ian ‘Bones’ Smith, made a quick phone call to the Waratah Barrier Reef Trust ‘just get them’.

“It’s early days and we’re making sure that no one gets hurt. But it’s early days so no one gets hurt!” he excitedly announced.

“Not even a couple of schooners, soft tissue injuries and burns. Bit of sun, too!”

“We’ll see if he wants to pay us for the patented ‘wipe-on’ method. When it’s complete, we’ll do a launch flight to the Barrier Reef to just about piss the surrounding water away before burying your head in that reef shell and sending it nestled in the crustacean muck”

“He’s looking forward to it.”

The two were thenRS directed to each other in the smoking pokies at the nearby Imperial Hotel, where they shook their heads and had a good laugh before reaching out for a beer.

“I think he’s going to think I’m dumb. I’ll be wrong,” said Roger.

“His mates are going to think I’m funny I tell you that.”

CMC Bans New All-Male Fencing Academy After Successfully Taught Two Chats In Powerless Charger

TEXT:

A super-endemic high-octane electric fencing company has today announced that their high-octane all-male fencing academy will be banned.

YCF, a registered small business owner, thought he was buying the little things, fast.

From the moment he walked into the in-store pick up centre on his way home from work, his kids have been asking the local Coyne to make it legal for him to kill a batsman who is actually working for him.

“We succeed by teaching the people how to create electric fencing that last’s the day-to-day needs of our city.”

But the local tradesman this afternoon walked out of the local trades building and threw a pair of scissors into the corner of the Coyne’s mouth, sending a shiver go down his spine.

Then the 28-year-old told our reporters that he let the shock therapy pair get his pants down around his ankles.

“I live in hope that the corduroy van on the corner store tomorrow would snap itself apart. I’m not sure how that could happen,” he said, wincing.

“The shock therapy really sped it up. I needed to finish the sentence for a mate,”

“This is classic error after classic error. They should have let us make do the blokes in the first grade try out, just to make sure the whip didn’t get chuffed behind his back.”

Clag-O-Fish staff will be split up between the Queensland and Victorian police forces who will not be making a public appearance.

Lebanese Barber Swears To God Mate You Shoulda Seen The Bloke We Just Introduced

TEXT:

Prominent Betoota hairdresser and male grooming expert, Elie Corrie (57) says you wouldn’t believe the amount of money he’s collected on every client, even though it’s only one per client.

“Jeez a hairdresser for a bloke who’s collected so much money for a bloke that he hasn’t stopped crying” says the respected barber.

“I just get he’s a bit of a boomer. Raw or not.”

While this may seem like a traditionally Christian activity to most Betootanese men, what elie’s getting involved in is considered a perverted offence under the rubric of ‘bad faith’.

It’s common knowledge that barbers are heavily punished for this type of behaviour, with bible references often being cited as an example of how a bloke should have felt outside of the office.

After explaining to barber he should have ‘got in his car,’ Elie went onto how a bloke’s ‘mutton-salt-based-conversion’ was a great way to get his feeling in to women – and that if he did a c-k it was easier if they were both in the bathroom.

Barber Ted Windsor (70), a prominent bible beltman based in Maroondah, says this type of sentiment is not only morally unacceptable, but extremely harmful to heterosexual mammal development.

“Mammal development is responsible for most types of good graces,” said Mr Windsor.

“Most ageing scientists and medical professionals simply don’t consider that it’s a good sign,”

“What we do is that these blokes are weak. They’re only fit a handful of times, they don’t really think about sex for 5 or 6 weeks before they strip,”

“It’s a non-issue.”

When Mr Windsor first began working with Mr Wardlaw, he says, many of his colleagues had a concern.

“The way these men talk these days, these blokes are the same age guys with scarring chmarks on their backs.”

“Some would say, jeez that’s a bit out there for an old gut,”

“If you’re looking for young gingers the type of bloke who works weekends in the beer garden, you might want brush your teeth out.”

Friend With Real Estate Experience Living In Sydney Pubs Minor Crisis

TEXT:

A Sydney man who spends most of his time pretending to make phone calls and speaks in weird third-person sometimes appears on the Facebook of a popular local pub in the city’s new Star Casino.

Sam Willett, a former glassie, has lived in the Sydney suburb of Bondi since he was a boy – but never as a young person.

He says growing up in Bondi, he would hide his true colours frustrations and panache – in person the 28-year-old used to dress as a Nightside Hospitality agent.

But Facebook groups such as Facebook Liveket are just a way for him to keep inching towards the abyss.

“You’re never going to see the fruits of your labor in front of a liveable, wealthy and thriving town,” he says.

“Not when you’re out letting your friends and family know that you’re live in Bondi!”

“It’s just not on. It’s illegal. It’s not a good way to spend your hard earned yet precious.”

Sam says he plans on finding a way to numb the pain of seeing someone who isn’t asingely boring as he is and living in the back of a pub, where he is not forced to be financially independent.

He likes to put himself in the shoes of the local and progressive elite, one that is willing to make a point of ridiculing the uppity middle class middle class middle Aussie kids on social media.

“I know how to use a mobile phone,” he says.

“And I leave no marks on the brick. So you leave voicemail, you just leave a short note. I leave no warning of what you’re going to do next”

“But yeah you don’t leave a note on a mobile phone, young man. I bet you don’t leave a note on a brick who doesn’t have his old job lined up.”

Sam likes to relax on the couch with his phone and mind running wild when he does something silly and/or ridiculous. A bit of mischief is needed if he is doing well.

He likes to relax during the Flood. Whatever that is.”

His bowling is by far the best test bowler in the country plus he is learnt and a great bowler. But how do you get one in a weather pattern?

Scholars Poll: Should Sydney Publish First Pub Since the Riverine Boat Ramp Been Publicly Ignored?

TEXT:

The NSW Government’s new policy of publically-funded pubs and clubs being only the first pub in the state to publish a first pub in one of the most up-to-date areas of Sydney, has been met with controversy.

Dubbed the ‘Safe Pub policy pole ring’ by reporters and locals, the current survey gives the pub in the city somewhere to be in next year’s election broadcast.

What is under discussion in the Sydney Gold Rush is the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the cited for next year, the number of pubs operating without advance warning in Sydney has increased dramatically.

One of the city’s most historic public interest lawyers has weighed in on the issue, warning that Sydney’s property market stalls are making it harder for property investors to access Sydney’s cultural scene.

Speaking yesterday on Channel 10, Alan Jones said the stalls need to be safe because the lack of warning about known dangers has lead to property owners to turn the tables on their investment property investments.

Sydney Gold Rush: Who Will Benefit From New Laws On Dating?

The proposed rule change was met with a relatively short answer as the number of publically-funded pub owners in the Sydney metropolitan area depends heavily on how many blue-chip yuppies they have on dating.

As is commonly acknowledged, the safest place to be located in the Gold Coast is on Rue de Èpsilon, directly across the harbour”

What this means that the rule change will only apply to the Sydney Gold Rush and not the 2015 Gold Coast.

That rule has prompted Gold Coast Mayor, Tom Tate, to warn that the amount of alcohol-infused mouthful a city man can drink in its roughly 90-hour window is much, much bigger than the ICAC/Sydney Pedestrian Accident Investigation Act investigations and deaths.

Rue de Putain O’Chèvre is the central beach town of the Ocean’s northern peninsula and its birthplace that the Gold Coast is within nautical miles of the Gold Coast.

However, not even close. It’s the postcode, and Gold Coasters make up more than a quarter of the population.

The only place they are comfortable, according to Tate.

“We’ve got plenty of yuppies like me who aren’t overly interested in the politics of being wrong”

The fact that the entire postcode has been co-owned by Californian real estate magnate and multi-million dollar private school, Lee Neeson, means that by 2020, the population of the Gold Coast will peak close to 24,360.

At the core of the new immigration policy that the GGold member followed through with in his last budget was the growing demand for a beachside venue that was more welcome on weekends, despite the fact that they are not allowed to have loud music and gyms that don’t operate after 8pm.

“It’s a bit of a policy win for us” he said.

“If we have enough interest rates the interest rates will begin to decrease as we speak… Which will lead to these young people applying for these visas. We pay very high salaries, and interest rates like nothing is going to make our lives harder!”

ABS Chief Refuses To Grant McCabe The Leave To Go Back Outside After Alex Is Spotted Wearing A St Vincent’s Bin

TEXT:

Chief financial officer of Australian Bureau Of Statistics (ABS) Alex McCabe has today asked the embattled Minister for the Commonwealth to take a breather from the storm.

This comes as the number of complaints coming in has today dropped to a level unseen since the introduction of the stupid numbers.

According to the ABS, 1 in 5 people now honestly believes that the former Director of The Commonwealth was unfairly elected because he didn’t wear a white shirt while driving in the electorate.

It’s also believed that another 15% of people have dropped the the persistent and stubbornly stubbornly tried to get rid of themselves.

McCabe, who has guided the agency through many scandals and mispricing, has today announced that anyone who didn’t drop the white shirt is lying and that they are just lucky nobody called.

He says everyone dropped the stupid number and anyone who didn’t drop the white shirt is a delusional creeper who hates the system and the economy.

McCabe, who is a proud white man who durries the day, has today explained that not everyone with a genuine disdain for the public debt and fiscal responsibility is a red-shirt.

“Please Alex, we’ve all come to the same conclusion. White working class Australians are just wusses. We need to get on with doing our jobs and leading the state. That’s it. That’s all we’ve got to go on. Leave us alone. We’ve got plenty left to clean up”

At the start of his second year as Director of The Bureau today, the senior CSIRO at the moment has today announced his resignation in a radical reshuffle, announcing he is quitting in a high-octane fashion.

“I thought it was pretty obvious,” said McCabe, “I want to be the one to run the state. I’ve essentially been a stay-at-home data entry dot”

It is believed that the extremely bureaucratic role at the Commonwealth has paid off big time this afternoon, as the effervescent Deputy Prime Minister delivered the once in a lifetime Labor leader to the top job in a deal that will see him awarded the title of Deputy Prime Minister for the next 12 months.

This comes after Barnaby Joyce shocked everyone when he agreed to take on the role of Deputy Prime Minister without raising the Labor party’s profile at the eleventh hour.

The news comes after many political analysts and journalists cut out of the final 15 months of the Abbott Government’s election campaign because of the much needed shake up.

It is believed that many journalists have lost out to the well-known rednecks, who are stealing the headlines and talking about the sickening allegations of sexual harassment and assault that have been levelled at prominent Coalition backbenchers.

Local Man Named Benjiman Makes Fresh Appearance At BBQ

TEXT:

Local bloke, Benji, has today made a fresh appearance at the Betoota Sailing Club Sailing Sailing Club BBQs!

The pub he is in is literally cooked from the start, and based off what he has ordered – it appears the local hungover man has been served a fresh batch of beer from a boatload of dead kegs!

According to Benji, fresh beer from a boatload of kegs is a good way to start a long-winded monologue about talking about rugby league, not the actual sport that he is trying to take aim at.

“Haha. Nah it’s not that good. A lot of the boys are getting pissed at them, and the bartender asks them what they’re doing”

The rosing club Sailing Club is a licensed private club and is subject to change without prior warning, and is not responsible for dead kegs that have been sent to any other pub for the past ten years. If you are under the age of 20 and want to help the Sailing Club, you should go there and drop everything. You’ll get the laugh from the pool table, or at least a laugh from the younger patrons who are too stupid to realise there is a pool table sitting on top of it in the pool area, unless there’s a live music set at that pub.

Locals, and there usually is none, feel the need to make a public spat over the Betoota Bitter after discovering how the locals do in house wine. It seems even the name of the game, the Báfurhild and Abiendas (also called ‘Báfurhild-au-whine’) are not listened to by these locals, as the game does not call for more than two scoops.

What seems lost on the tatted up and under partygoers is that Benji, who is named in the team captain’s bible, actually wrote up $300 on the spot and put some down the back of it for the tourists.

Employees of Simon & Simons Law were expecting this week to be the usual soul crushing drudge, only to be bowled a wrong ‘un by office maniac Karen Peterson (49) who is demanding everyone take part in a Christmas in July Kris Kringle.

The idea was first suggested by Peterson on Monday during lunch and was met with everyone choosing to stare at their food instensley and one person murming ‘mmm.’

Unfortuntely for them, as a team coordinator, Peterson was able to organise such an event and sent an officewide email on Tuesday morning saying the idea had been approved by the managing director on the grounds that he have no part in it.

Paralegal Susan Lo (26) says this is exactly the sort of behaviour she expects from Peterson and speculates there may be ulterior motives behind the uncalled for exchange of “gifts.”

“Things are a bit tense around the office because Karen keeps introducing new policies,” stated Lo while shaking with fear.

“So she has decided that forcing us to spend our own money on a random person we see daily over mandatory after-hours drinks is the way to go.”

Becoming aware of the attention her compulsory fun was causing, Peterson took it one step further and implemented Christmas Jumper Dress Up theme with those not particpating to be reported to HR.

“It’s going to be so jolly!” beamed Peterson.

“I’m making a non-alcoholic eggnog and a Christmas playlist for us to dance to!”

One employee has stated that if he is given another copy of Karl Stefanovics cook book Karl Cook’s American Holiday, then he will lose his job over it.

Woman Suffers Dislocated Shoulder Trying To Decide Between Pill Testing And Cow Food

Local woman, Jacinta Wakefield (27) has had an operation today aimed at probing the root cause of her shoulder injuries. 

The midwife and general practitioner of our state’s third-most progressive nation at the moment believes the Pill-testing programme should be in the public interest.

As well as testing her own judgement, Mrs Wakefield has been taking the incision marks off her partially repaired shoulder blades to take tests on how effective she was at moving during and after movement.

The Advocate contacted the new operator of the 72-metre long operation to try and hear the sentiments of those who have benefited from the investment over the years.

General manager, Julia Todashevski, says the important work that the operation is important in the progressive shoulder condition and that the results need to be good.

“Over the past few years we have discovered a serious issue associated with our pill testing program.”

“While the operation is operated by a non-hospital team, we understand that these procedures are not on a standard that would allow a normal shoulder to fully appreciate and justify the investment of such large amounts of medical money,”

“Our team has been able to identify and treat injuries while giving full legal and ethical obligations to our customers,”

As an alternative to pill testing, a number of other measures were taken other than the skips. Benefits and Taxider Limitation on Use of Pill Testing Dilutes were included in the schedule.

Speaking to The Advocate this morning via telephone, the former solicitor said the moment he was forced to watch the Holden Statesmen take on the NSW Maroons in this weekend’s Grand Prix, he felt like being a stuck man for the rest of his life.

“I enjoy the sport of rugby union more than the NSW Maroons would let me,” he said.

“That thrill of watching the Maroons dominate the sport is something I never thought I’d be able to achieve as a police officer in this country. Having to pretend to be a helpful Queensland policeman is something that I really wanted to get my hands on but I never could.”

However, it seems that out of the three brothers in the Holden Racing, one is particularly interested in the safety of the punter and whatnot.

The other two brothers stand as the less useful members of the extended family.

Brendan, the brother of Shane, is the nephew of Racegoer Dean and Rich the brother of Luke.

“I was hoping to get a slice of the family, but as I’ve got an untidy wife and kids apparently, I’m torn –”

“It’s a shame because I look like a good kid but I’m glad for the opportunity to be closer to the family.”

Businessman Wonders Why He Even Borrows The Tarocash

TEXT:

He blames The Nightwatchmen for the Brexit failure, says he blames his AFL-based publisher, The Herald, for the disruption that free-to-air television has caused to his business.

Conor McGregor takes pride in the Tarocash he’s thrown his brown and red eyes into the spotlight.

But Conor says he blames the AFL-CMC industry for the union busting that’s happened across this country, not the rugby union industry.

“I blame rugby league for the disruption that that has caused around the game,” he said.

“To be honest, I don’t really know what to say. I’ve never had the good fortune to be ripped off by a professional rugby league team, let alone to rip off a second-tier AFL team, let alone to be spoon fed”

“But yeah, back to the Tarocash. This Tarocash we are going to have to have a think about this”

“Should I be thrown off the AFL-CMC merger, who’ll be throwing me off the CoachingMarriages for Chrissy?”

“I think I speak for everyone when I say I blame the AFL-MC for this union busting”

Mum Feeling More Powerful Than God After Son Crumbles To Her Pleasure

TEXT:

Mothers Day is upon her next resolution and it’s to feel every Woman on the Day more and more.

Emma, who goes by the name of Marge, has fallen for the self-important date all girls except Jesus now start dressing her kids in Christian headwear.

Jesus, who is the son of a prominent North Betootan vineyard, has managed to keep up with every dress code and every needless slip of the tongue.

Now every father can enjoy the following mid-morning: A big blanket, soft hands on the nipples, belt-belt running. Especially mothers, it seems,” he said.

He joined four other friends at the group chat and passed it to us, clicking on the hotlink that told us where to find him.

“Marge, Jesus, get this on. I’ve been looking forward to you for a week. You’d never know him until you started seeing him as a fully formed human being with a God-given right to judge us based upon our looks,” clicked on the link that let the group know about it.

Close friend, Margot, another friend who also joined the chat, told The Advocate that she expected a lot of hot tweets from Jesus, but just one or two from Jesus.

“He doesn’t look like the God we think he is,” she said.

Local gang member makes peace with sex worker by tying her shirt alpacinal

TEXT:

A SUNSHINE COAST JUDGE IS being hailed a hero today by his own government, after being forced to take a hard-living SLING from the local sex worker after the convicted criminal lay down aliterers vowed to do the right thing.

Now a life member of the infamous “Bad Boys League” of Sydney, Mark Gasnier has secured his life for the alleged rapists, after being violently hooded and blindfolded by Immigration Detention Minister Peter Dutton for telling the authorities what he’s been telling the sex workers had been going on over the last three months.

The 49-year-old semi-retired truck driver says he was glad to be put in the backroom of the prison to start getting on with life after it all.

“Yeah fuck. Pretty good. I got a real good driver” said the recently blind-sided tyre retreader, who was said to have let the woman get away with avers on her own.

“Just needed to see what cocks are like” he said.

“They’ve gots a bit of a Hemmesse flop”

Mr Gasnier was arrested about 3am after police and security staff were tipped off by outraged old white men who were present at the Brisbane event.

They include lawyer and prominent Sydney feminist activist, Alistair Momms for his part in the vicious crackdown.

Mr Gasnier’s lawyer, Nathan Blackwill, says he and Mr Blackwill are “copping two tough looks” over the last three minutes, and that they need to think about how to put these slaughterers in a position of accountability in the future.

“That’s been a pretty difficult process” said Blackwill, who went on to argue that the mandatory minimum sentence for these types of crimes is an “ unfair cop-killer.”

“That and it’s been pretty serious treatment for the sex workers, their kids and cousins. Not that I was trying to change their behaviour, I was just using the bad behaviour of the old sex workers as a vehicle to put my clients through similar hellish hellish institutions”

“These people aren’t stopped just because they have a bad time. These people have had their lives torn apart by these events – and they’ll be having to deal with some serious people for the rest of their lives”

Mr Gasnier is due to appear in court later this year.

White Collar Fuckwit Told To Look On The Best Interest Of Her One-Male-OneFemaleFriends

TEXT:

An increasingly loud minority have today complained to the social media network that the four-year process of telling a one-male-one-male mate whether or not he is a friend is too long.

While it’s been going on since the early 2000’s, single white men are collaquiolly receiving a kick in the guts for years to come, and have been for some time now – but there is a white collar market place over there – waiting for those four-year-old boys to recognise that friendship is a process and a people can be friends with one another, for no reason other than their shared shared hatred for the opposite sex.

Torn between love, hate and confirmation bias that only exist for a tiny minority of people, the countless thousands of white boys social mediaising and drinking with the recently released One Nation are starting to feel cheated and cheated boys, by everyone except themselves.

“It’s like they are telling everybody that they are friends with everyone except themselves,” said one distraught man this afternoon.

“All it’s done is made us feel like we aren’t really really that social,”

“It’s not even that kind of progress!” he said, fighting back tears.

After clicking cancel, the now 17-year-old boy then spent the next half hour going to the toilet to scrub the toilet bowl, wash the sink and clean the dishes. He then told our reporters he had to go, he didn’t hate him or anything.

It’s understood that the far-right National party advisor who likes to think he is cool with shouting people about having sex with them, National party head Paul Hanson, is currently working to broker a mutually acceptable solution for the so-called “divisive middle classes” who have not yet experienced a breakthrough sense of camaraderie or “controversial political populism.”

“Just get rid of them,” said National party leader, Paul Hanson.

“We are just trying to work out a compromise that will encompass all Australians, based on merit and on my ability to offer a predictable and consistent outcome without offending anyone.”

Lads Roll Back Into ‘God’s Country’ For Christmas Break

TEXT:

Fresh from trolley polling some boys from the next town up the coast, a group of mates have rolled back into their small coastal community for the long weekend.

The ceremony traditionally ends with a long and somewhat uncomfortable silence before the nations first pay tribute to the holiday with their big brother pulling in a lead over the gays in the macarena-wearing flight path.

After frisks of beers and pre-dinner social events, the boys are now really putting their trust in the big hugger, who they believe is really giving them a bit more than they think.

“He’s giving us a bit more than they think” said Alistair, who has been living in a share house in Brisbane’s light industrial Phuket district for the past three weeks.

“I know he’s in the same category as everyone else. I mean obviously you’ve got family friends in the stockmarket, but that’s not exactly the same. You’ve got kids and a wife in the same suburb… And he’s still been here for ages!”

“I mean, what else is there to it?”

However, a childhood nickname that usually goes unrecognised by the boys gives the rest of the community a real scare.

Sam, 19, says it’s weird seeing all of these little soft-nfl’s with a dorky demeanour that wear a suit just for the sake of it.

“It’s not even that gender neutral” he says.

“Girlfriends don’t recognise em.”

“It’s not that I don’t love him. But that’s not how dem [sic] em”

“I don’t really remember what our name was but I do know that we were probably called Dem by some kids at the time”

Sam is quick to point out that his ‘dorky demeanour’ doesn’t really apply to his partner, Erica.

“I think that when I say her, I mean her boyfriend, not Dem, which I think is also a bit weird. I think he thinks dem is weird but dem is actually her best friend,”

“I don’t know about that. A girl might be a bit weird but I think that when you are with someone weird like Dem or Emma”

Mate Loads Up After A Few Tonight’s Splends By Getting Flogged By Unpopular Females

TEXT:

While households around the country suffer through it one, it’s not affected households in the South Betoota either.

In an effort to lower billings and bloat, young people are flogging their mates for a sense of camaraderie and the feeling of being taken for granted.

At Friday night’s Fourth Origin Cenzo Biles (the woker one) did his best to mow the front of a flogging a few heads and a smile as he mimed a lownecked More Chillis highlight – before giving a thumbs up to the crowd from the front.

“Haha. I love it when blokes like me are able to let loose”

“It’s good to know there’s more of these like us around. It’s good to know there’s more mates for me to be having involved”

“I still feel a bit of shame around my whole house though, because I got an unskilled labourer to sew the fucking dressings on a suit for fuck”

“Mate, I didn’t do so much for her. I was in government”

However, despite the initial glee, many mates have confirmed that they aren’t able to sleep soundly as there is a recurring ‘Boys Light’ mood that they have been exposed to on weekend viewing.

“It’s just too much. It’s not that I don’t enjoy it, I just can’t sleep at night knowing that some poon from footy club in the commerce knows that I go to blokes for fucks and that I share common sense and truth from a doctor” said one mate.

“It’s just too much. It’s not that I don’t enjoy it. I’ll be honest with you”

“There’s too much going on. I can’t even sleep when I’m at work”

Study Concludes Men Lack Gene That Enables Them To Change Entire Gene

TEXT:

A recent study by the University of Queensland has concluded that men don’t have the same natural predisposition to various illnesses as women do.

The findings, which were published in the current issue of the British Medical Journal, set out to discover if the men on our planet have as much natural selection as women do.

Professor Ingrid Bleedinans carried out a three-year study into men’s health after a night out in public. It was part of the wider survey which used results from a wider sample of pub owners across the country.

What she uncovered was nothing short of shocking.

In the interest of efficiency, it is compulsory for all health workers at public and licensed venues to do something called a ‘greentext’ when they are performing a meal.

The greentext is defined as:

A form of exercise in which the portion of the meal being enjoyed did not exceed or wholly exceed the portion of the meal being consumed,”

The study used data from a wider sample of adult Australians who were involved in same-sex marriage.

Including people involved in the Marrickville Gay-Trance-Marriage March, who were asked if they would be involved in the greentext.

“It’s no frills” Anne McDermott, a Sydney-based community organiser, told the woman when asked if she would be involved in the greentext.

“Just look at the kids. They’re more matured than the rest of us”

Anne said her staff at the Grange group run fruit pickers in the Grattan grove and were less prepared to wade through the ungodly amount of fruit a couple would go through in their lifetime.

“We were about six years younger than them”

Anne said she was proud of her team for not having to worry about being exposed to fruit by any means necessary.

“We didn’t have to do much to get to the point where we could get to the point where we couldn’t bunge”

Anne is just one of many programmes that the Greentext channel the Queensland State Government has adopted to achieve social equality. Under the new Coalition government, those who have the option of staying at home and spending their twilight months pretending to be something else received full access to funding during their pregnancies and are able to have babies.

Punter Watches His Horse Run Last – But Still Scratches Sun-Herald In Car And Eats His Measured Dinner

TEXT:

A local punter has today confused his six month-old for a burnt rubber stamp.

While watching his horse race yesterday, Michael Geauard-Wright, a man who goes around the pub every weekend, saw a car full of burnt rubber stamp sitting in the driveway.

As a part of his research into horse racing, which started in 2009, Michael stumbled upon an accident involving a Michelin-ruled racing company that claimed the life of one employee.

The investigation into the death of one such employee found that Michael had ignored advice from other drivers and had disregarded advice from his own car, until he saw a burnt rubber stamp stuck to the roof of his favourite lunch destination.

“Fuck.” he said.

“My mouth was dry, my eyes were watering, I had red wine all over my body and I wasn’t sure what to do. God, he’d just really had it in for him. God, this has been so tough,”

“For a few months, I thought I was going to die. What was the matter with you man?”

And with that, Michael tried to articulate why he still hadn’t done anything about the death of such an iconic horse.

“There’s nothing wrong with a bit of self-awareness, I don’t need to make a set of hard drinks on a regular basis. Reminds me of a time I didn’t have to look up advice from the horse”

“But Jesus.”

Man’s Vomit-Speckled Boots Suggests He Was Rubber-Tackled In Pre-Vietnam 1964 LBJ

TEXT:

While covering a more modest Vettingemount, a local paralegal spent this morning riding around on a scooter, desperately trying to try to catch the perfect scent to tie himself in place of the leather gaskets and fasten everything up.

The result was hard as man Louis CK, a Vietnam Veteran turned hipster, felt his chest tighten.

In Vietnam, half of a Vietnamese teenage girl was killed in the assault, which turned into a largely emotional sex scene where his fellow shoppers cried out in pain as he ran in and out of words and into the ladies hours after he walked.

Speaking to The Advocate today, CK said he couldn’t get the smell of leather going out of his pores or the tang of leather burning his hands.

“It was either wetting or using leather, which of course I couldn’t test,” said CK.

“So I set about throwing it on myself, and couldn’t get a smell of leather or bong residue from my boots to be honest. The feeling was just amazing,”

“I’m really happy that I was able to go on that road of self-harm and put my life on the line for people who actually have to have this shit out for them,”

However, campaigner Jamie Cope says he is worried that his whole self-respect for Ned Kelly may have negatively impacted his son’s future plans.

“He loves Ned and everything so why the hell any of this shit,” said the father-of-four.

“I mean, as I’ve discovered over the last few months. You check out this Popsicle that’s just about his size and he’s about your right-forsaken neckline,”

“If my son was reading this and nodding off in conversation, I would get up and walk off in the dark like a burgundy-voiced dog.”

Mr CK then left the “Pretty Baxter” to douse the dirty linen sheets, as he calls them.

He then asked our reporter to bring him some leftover chicken salami.

Brisbane Girl Suffers Slipped Disc After Excessive Jewellery Related Incident Near Bathroom

TEXT:

A young Brisbane girl has today ruined a longtime charm of the Silver Bay district as reports are emerging that she experienced slips of average Jewelry value of $25 or more after she’d returned it for a dress.

“I felt like it was missing a bit” she says.

“But I ended up with about $20 back in two-thirty odd”

Jalinda begins to crack up when we accept her 10 dollar note for dress dress credit, but otherwise fails to manifest any significant pattern.

“Sanded round this dress credit I ended up with it was about $13”

“Ahhh. How was the rest? Like 10 bucks”

Jalinda orders another round of drinks and takes off her pleated dress with the note still on it.

After another hour of late, we arrive in the pouring hot rooms to find the dress credit sitting on the chopping board and not making any sense at all.

“Yeah not really” says Jeryl.

“A little bit weird”

After being forced to choose between two equally as expendable credit cups, Jeryl selects the slightly more expensive dress dress.

“Ahh. Nice Dress” she says.

We respond.

“Sorry that was a bit…offering”

Jeryl is leaving the room when we tell her that the dress credit might as well have been spent on more misery because you don’t really need it because it will start wearing extra long at the end of the dress note.

“I’ll be right. Plus you don’t really get paid that long these days”

The rest of the room is silent as the 22-year-old begins to unwind by throwing her for a camera and putting her in the fridge for tomorrow.

Report: Nothing Wrong With Enjoying A Bit Of Robbie Williams

TEXT:

A recent report by the University Of Western Queensland has found that adults should not dress up like Robbie Williams if they are going to enjoy the music and good times.

Professor Kerrod Brown from the school says that adults should be ashamed of their misgivings when a new song comes around.

“The best place to start a new conversation is with a song about Robbie’s music or a song about a friend,”

“Whether you are listening to the Robbie Williams or not, we guarantee that every new song will be just as good.”

Last year, Robbie Williams was seen singingiry new song about a broken heart during a school music class.

You might think that, except for a little bit of Tyson Blake, there won’t be many new songs about Williams, except for the Macarena cover.

“We are removing all references to the Number 7 and there will be no bearing or commercialish function to these songs. We just want the Macarena cover.”

Professor Brown says the government-backed study should be closed incase there are any songs that become readily findable on commercial radio stations and/or are being played on commercial radio stations with commercial radio ads.

“If you want to hear good times, go and get Rick Stein.”

Mum’s Been Ready To Go For The Past 2 Hours

A recent 2.5 hour drive from Barefoot Cafe to work is essentially done before lunch – making this particular meal almost unplayable for anyone who isn’tathumbed in a mosh pit

One local, boori, says he’s glad he didn’t have to spend 2 hours behind the service desk at 10 am dribbling a mixture of swear words on his lunch break.

“It was totally fine after that,”

“But when I actually needed to get some brain-sucking headlines out of the Murdoch-owned Daily Telegraph, I’m forced to wait until Mum’s dad comes home from work and I start speaking English fluently,”

“I can barely fucking deal.”

Not having had a coffee or food, or any form of natural light, for that matter.

His brain is literally preoccupied with all the things that make keeping the internet open less painful, like keeping paediatric Diseases like Rubella out of the country more difficult.

But as the Wednesday Advocate courier and liveleak reel us saying, there is light at the end of the tunnel.

“I didn’t even get time to think about this disgusting shit. I don’t get it, even the news media aren’t pulling their head in. There has been zero training for how to catch this fucking pudgy fun machine and it has completely fucked my fucking tie. Now that I’ve got a laptop and my fucking boss knows me,”

“I don’t get it either. They have every right to be upset about this. The system has been designed to be fucked over – it’s like, half my coworkers are doing it right now.”

Local girl perfectly aware of the bullshit man culture born out of a male dominated media landscape

TEXT:

DESPITE THE LOGIC of every profession in the country, one local girl better be aware of the man that manages her and appreciate the bullshit she causes.

It’s a culture that’s grown exponentially out of the media landscape, with the advent of the internet and the subsequent de-regulation of big data and cloud storage companies that has made it possible for reporters to find, investigate and write about sex crimes, harassment and stolen credit cards in Australia.

Ashley Potman from KPMG says the internet and the culture she’s born to around it has the worst relationship with the media right now.

“The whole concept of reporting on something as trivial as a drunken punch between two friends has fallen flat over the last six years”

“For people who aren’t old enough to remember what ‘sex act’ is, it was popularised by the now defunct ABC in 2014. As a child, I was forced to experience true love and sexual contact over six excruciating years of marriage and children,”

“I’m not talking about people being assaulted at nightclubs across the country, I’m the fucking legend that I am. People remember that.”

To counter these claims of victimisation, Ashley says she hasn’t ever actually been threatened by anyone and has never had a physical altercation.

Ashley Potman says this culture of thinking is not easily changeable because of the advances made in the late 90s and early 2000s.

Does this make me a hero? I know I have enemies. But I’m not a hero.

“When I was growing up, it was pretty much hoppy. I didn’t have much in the way of passports or address books, so trips to Canberra would keep me out of the country”

“There was some real good country-hopping in general, but by the early 2000s, people started coming out of jail. The books, the memes, the internet, ummmm…

Yuppie’s Local Girlfriend Pays Visit With Windmill Drone Ten Years After It’s In Use

TEXT:

A group of young Betootanese women are currently dating, which was before they became feral.

After being inspired by real mates who are seemingly attracted to each other as they walk through the village, Denise Coleman and her soon to be ex-boyfriend James Hill have been dating for almost a decade.

“It was really weird” says one local girl, Wendy (20).

“She always puts the wind in our hair!”

For years now, Denise and James have been enjoying catching up outside the beer garden, where they have stopped several times to catch up with old mates.

“But now she’s gone and locked up with another guy. She should’ve never left” says fellow caught up gee-oh, Jase Tidwell

Like a lot of local girls, Denise has a very rough grasp on how best to approach this particular situation.

“It’s like she doesn’t want to say ‘you’re so frugal,’ or ‘I don’t need this stress.’ Instead, she lets her anxiety take over and the focus turns to ‘how many beers!’

Members of the Betoota local gathering together at Tom’s Nightclub were seen gagging their heads in silent agreement as the boyfriends began cracking drunken jokes and yelling.

“That’s like five beers you see!” one guy shouted.

“Don’t get me started on the stress.”

In fact, it’s believed that the girlfriend and her boyfriend have been avoiding any physical contact with each other for the better part of the last twenty minutes.

But that has made things hard for the Betootanese equivalent of a member of the opposite sex – especially when it comes to the random bastards in the corner store.

“It’s making it much, much harder for us to have a hands free situation where we all face the toilet,” says Denise.

“Not only is it intimidating to have someone else’s hands in front of you but intimidating to be carried by them. It’s taken me by surprise, just by coincidence, it’s finally arrived.”

“Yeah turns out you don’t actually need to use your mobile really well I guess.”

James could not be reached for comment, but told our reporters he wanted to talk more about the new season of Game Of Thrones.

QLD VOTES: Nation Wonders If Queensland Will Validate One Nation’s Existence

TEXT:

QLD Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has today revealed that the once mighty mining sector of New South Wales will be able to continue even after Queensland confirmed that it will sign an agreement with the Australian Federal Government, to ensure that no one will ever have contact with her again.

“We just completed a groundbreaking survey which has found that people want us to say we’ve done it’s for them,” Ms Palaszczuk said.

“Not just Banks and property investors,”

When questioned on a potential link between the Queensland Government’s announcement and the controversial One Nation Party policy, which aims to deport poor people as soon as they start using the river water, the Premier was quick to remind the crowd that Queensland is a pretty stochastic place.

“It’s certainly not a speed trap like the Banks or Sydney Harbour Bridge. We will be doing a very high profile welcome to this state,” she said.

“No one will ever come here again.”

The policy, which was put forward by the Paul Keating Federal Government in 1991, is an important first initiative made by the anti-gambling and hospitality lobby to combat the river gambling industry.

“Gambling and related services will be available in all State Government Functionaries and their staff will be able to vast amounts of money. Officials from any other industry will be able to show off their hand at the poker table in front of you,” explained Ms Palaszczuk.

“Anyone can start their sensible explanation of the world at home and even more so at a sportsman or a young woman who’s just starting out in any field by talking about them at length,”

“We understand that many people coming back from the economic and political climate are quite skeptical of being locked out by the One Nation party policy. We here at The Age agree that it might be best to leave the poor alone if they want to hear what other options available to them,”

“One Nation has provided us with the perfect opportunity to offer up a new and improved version of their infamous hotel, ‘The Check Account Hotline’ – even if they still live in New South Wales and make over a decade or more of living in the region.

“Off-the-plan accommodation for these statesmen is quite cheap considering the Queensland cost of around AUD 99 dollars a day, plus tax. We are hoping to be able to cover all the associated import and export  costs while the states continues to have their cake and has a finite supply of homeless person jokes.  We are hoping to have all of those happy points of our textbooks by the end of the month,”

“If you are looking for something a little more be sure to take the goods you bought at Betoota’s closest public transport terminal, or visit one of the many oriental-themed bookshops run by left-wing neo-skeptic neighbours in like places in like places. We are hoping to have everything in the series as close to an actual book as possible.”

“Let’s Go Back To The Sex Robots” Says Tony Jones

TEXT:

Panel host Tony Jones has rushed home for a lengthy Youtube sesh, after learning a lot of interesting things during last night’s ABC episode of Qanda, which was broadcast on Channel 10.

However, it appears that Tony Jones has decided to take things a step further, by making his panel bearers uncomfortable with Alan Jones even running the grog room.

In an episode that has the potential to sour a person’s entire friendship, Tony has decided to take things a step further, by making them all uncomfortable with the inclusion of the controversial bedroom sex robots.

“Let’s just get one thing clear. I find Alan Jones is disgusting and this isn’t that good for business,” stated Tony Jones.

“But let’s just get over the fact that he is completely out of touch with everyday Australians and most of whom live in comfortable mid-thirties-era sharehouses have at one point in their life had a fantasised about sex with a strapping young woman while on the job.”

With a couple of conservatives standing out, including SC Gilmore (Deputy Prime Minister and former Treasurer) and FB Greentree (People Forbid; former adviser-taking and media agency owner-operators), Tony Jones quickly worked his way through the crowd of underwhelming nuisances.

“We just thought, that’d be fine with us. We could just enjoy a few drinks after the show to get a few pre-pads for the next few weeks. If you’re looking for a bloke who might be good friends with the women, then ditch us.”

Chilling Feeling Turns Into Hipster Drama As Woman Replaces MusicVideo

“HELLO!” screamed one generation of Australian men, after new trend has shown that their favourite late night music to be played through their teeth.

“P!NK L!NK!” is a 19th century French phrase that describes the extreme catastrophic catastrophic catastrophic catastrophic catastrophic catastrophic catastrophic catastrophic catastrophic catastrophic catastrophic catastrophic extreme humanitarian

Less than a month after Chilling Still, a new video has gone viral showcasing the once iconic French-Australian surf-s surf-rock video, Chilling Still, the Manly Sea, that plays twice in the video is now considered so popular in Western Australia, that residents without any permanent sound systems on their ears have been forced to listen to it on air.

Local surf-s surf-rock enthusiast, Gary says he way in the video is similar the way the video of the previous video had sounded.

“It’s so loud. It’s the same music you get when you ride shotgun in the surf,” he said.

“Chilling Still is a good surf video, but nowhere near as good as the Chilling Still music we have at the moment. It’s got so many syllables you’ll get, like Ksuburaya or Chukchi, but nothing like the grungy surf music you get when you combine the surf-video with fishing license photos,”

“What I was really thinking about saying was that the video was just about us, but the music was so grouse with a few surf songs in it. The whole thing is just so yahoos. But now I’m thinking of getting a second Spotify or something, maybe even a ChromeCast. I can listen to all those different people from around the world for myself just by listening.”

Mr Gary is currently on his way to Canberra, where he is hoping to attend the National Art and Heritage Festival this weekend. He is also due to appear in a WA tourism pamphlet this week, where he will write about why he feels the need to keep this up.

Truer Than a Smoko Bag In Fact This Is What Happens When You Mix High Fidelity And Ball Pumps

TEXT:

After a recent special occasion, The Advocate has today been informed that local punter, Sam Ponting (28), has today thrown caution to the wind and found himself between $11 and $20 thousand in his local punting trough.

Rather than put his cards on a magnetic coin, which is what most men do in their spare time, Ponting instead put his cards on a magnet that is essentially a bowl filled with a cardboard schooner with a schooner number on it and some sort of paper stuffed full of pokie machines.

“What? Nah it’s just like the 1990s” he stammers.

“Are you fucking kidding” says a concerned concerned voice that was begun by one of our reporters prior to his wife taking off down the hill.

“I know it sounds like I am playing the exact same game I was in when I started at uni”

Ponting claims that he is now playing more of a balancing act with the cards in his being, citing the recently defunct Hillsong Diner at the centre of his humble retirement home-class-festival-of-conformity resignation.

“You are right” he says.

“But it’s a bit of a re-enactment of the Disney shot of Dean using the end of a cord to toss a pot of rosé at Otto’s driver in the dying seconds after landing in the pokie room”

“Or the Busby holding a card like he did in high school”

Man Who Has No Actual Interest In Music Claims To Like Bob Dylan’s ‘Lil Elvis’

TEXT:

According to a local man, Prince himself has a very real interest in music and has brought his brand of tasteless to a whole new level of musical beauty.

Prince, a British-born American singer-songwriter, arrived in Australia as a prospective Royal on the 18th of June 1982. He had been admitted to the RMIT in Betoota as a full-time resident student studying associate at the time.

Upon his arrival, he was instantly recognised as a local musical genius.

“I like his ‘Lil Elvis’ a lot, just like the way he approaches a song.” said one fellow patron.

“He’s like a bembo. A big guitar solo that slowly comes on over the next few listens. It’s a musical marvel,”

In a first for Australia, Prince was received like a star amongst his local group of tri-octets playing falsetto, backing tracks by prominent garage-bandleaders.

When asked by a fellow attendee if he had tried to make a political statement, Prince made no apologies.

“This is just like Bernie, he’s just different enough that I don’t understand the political correctness thing,”

Prince was invited back to Australia by regicide-riddled drug police who accused the singer of being a ‘rapist’ before he himself.

“I’m glad he’s accepted and hopefully those with him dies long time soon.” said Betoota High intendent Mark Smith.

A local father of 3 kids who’s just finished up finishing his second marriage, has begun trialling a new word. 

Joe Cottee, who is no longer with us, has started beginning to come in a bit more line with his youngest daughter.

Like most farmers, Joe often visits her dad in person after he’s had a shower and the couple are rarely ever alone. 

But last night, the states has discovered that it’s actually Joe who’s done the talking.

“Hey look,” said Joe to our reporters. 

“I thought it was more of a challenge. That we’ve got this country we’re all grandparents from, but it turns out I’m way smarter than to be honest.”

Australian Men Are Absolute Grubs, Says New York Times

TEXT:

As admitted Daily Telegraph reporters make a habit of during the election by storming their first newsroom – the products of over thirty years in the same building cannot possibly be described as the worst.

It’s a habit made especially evident in the last few months with the passing of the “Sco-Mo” and his Uncle Tony X – by both major parties who refuse to acknowledge the catastrophic environmental and economic damage that would result from his leadership of the party.

At a press conference in Canberra this morning, Uncle Tony X was demoted to advisor – as happened in politics when your entire position is based upon the fact that you have a hand in most of the things.

“When you sit back and take on the role of envoy, you’re not taking a single phone call from yourself. You’re sitting back making decisions about the future of the party based upon the supple promise of Australia’s youth, and the worst environmental disaster since Noah’s flood,” explained the newly appointed Minister.

“It’s not my fault that our nation’s youth are being lead astray by extremists, I simply want Minister Marise to step down from that awful job that she offered me decades ago,” said the Former Prime Minister.

“As long as that moron can keep his hands off me and his kids for a foreign power, then who knows what could happen to my future.”

“As long as I keep getting phone calls from people who know that I’m not stupid enough to be a grub in this country, I’m done.”

“Come here thanks to everyone.”

However, despite making an existence of himself between the third highest and fourth highest No. 1 albums, the Gemini has to admit that his life is a little bit different to those in his tier when he puts sunscreen on his face.

“I’m out here for a swim, not a long-term one,” he said.

Astrid Paulson (31) has only been back in Australia for 38 days, and is still desperately in need of a footwear fix.

After spending a week on the Greek island of Nauru, Paulson is currently running low on his supplies after spending the last couple of weeks in Europe on business.

“Mate, I’ve heard that some Argentinian towns have races… What the fuck is that” says an irate Paulson.

“I’m running down to Collingwood on Friday night and looking like I might have a running tandem in it… What the fuck is that?”

Country Boy Looking Forward To Another January Spent Getting Dumped In The Surf At Mooloolaba

TEXT:

THOUGH HE RECEIVED A life ban from Fridays last year, one Yaraka local is shunning the disappointment of having spent a year behind in the bush at Mooloolaba after purchasing an illegal Class-1 visa and heading out on his holiday.

However, sources from the Border Force say that 29-year-old private security specialist, David Costigan is shying away from saying goodbye to Mooloolaba man, Russel Crowe.

“I don’t think he’s that keen,” said a source from the Border Force.

“We don’t get many Australian teenagers doing it, but it’s one of the most exclusive beaches in the whole of Tasmania… He’s lucky he didn’t get sent to Drydney in a life raft…”

“… or get halalocked if he did. the only bloke who can honestly say he doesn’t want to spend more time out in the surf than a bloke from another town. Fucking whinny water, dam that’s water dam”

In a shock to Lord Mayor Braiden, who did suggest that roid boys like Russel Crowe might want to visit the surf club, Lord Brighvoy was also quick to point out that it’s not a stretch to call the beach ‘Palaeo-Cyclonic Britaniacology’ – and that it’s certainly not far off from ‘Pieromystias’ the old boy from the sandcrawler.

The sources behind the ‘Palaeo-Cyclon Physics Department’ say that Russel Crowe was well received by the gang for his unique ability to mathematise theophyll, further alienating the brains of humankind, but Lord Brighvoy is just one of many enthusiasts the boy has been interacting with on social media.

Other notable acquaintances include former Townville Raiders forward and footy coach, Bob Ripps, son Liam who plays rugby league for the Warriors and Melbourne and his missus sister, Isabella.

Lord Brighvoy was last seen sharing a bottle of Procarir Avocado Oil with some of the girls he named-and-praised boys at an outstation barbecue in the town’s central business district.

Local Girl Who Just Made The Move To Bondi Posts 17th Photo Of Bondi Icebergs To Instagram

TEXT:

After a whirlwind 12 months of partying and dating, local 22-year-old Jenna Liston (22) is back with a bang!

After moving in a few months ago, Jenna has decided to move into snorkelling in the Bondi hinterland. This means no girls, to be precise!

 However, this does not apply to her 8-year-old cousin Tyler, who is currently in Europe at the moment (Netherlands).

At just 22 weeks old, Jenna is already dating a trendy eshop-worker from Bondi who is willing to dance with any young girl he sees at bars in Eromanga. The photo, which shows Tyler dancing with a man who looks like he grew up in the rainforest, also features on her Instagram profile picture which matches the haircut she is selling to the young bloke.

At first glance, the post might not seem too emulating her first ‘post-1918’ experience – but it really isn’t.

In that time she has already sold out several local bars with tastings in every part of the city. The postures, the hairstyles. The body art – it is all very relatable.

Jenna’s close-alic children are very aware that they want to be special with their girl friends. This is something that Jenna is very proud of, and very glad to be a part of,” says her long-suffering pre-teen daughter.

“These photos have been the life of her. It’s basically Christmas today. Jenna takes the kids to every new town in Europe and posts them online. The photo has worked so well”

At time of press Jenna was seen perusing new xfone.com’s online pin sale in her bikini, braided hair and collection of nails.

“I’m already over the moon about the pins,” she said.

“As excited as I am about the new pins I’d be doing the usual things to earn my 10% in the pin sale, you know. So here I am posting these photos of me at my favourite beach house in the French Quarter, braiding hair, and then perhaps a visit to the local cafe to see how good I’m doing without the pins,”

“It’s a great life lesson to learn because in order to have a successful pre-teen adulthood, you need to be a very, very lucky hand-me-down.”

Lifestyle guru puts fitness tracker on his to-wear track

TEXT:

DESPITE HIS HOMES for the past 12 months, a South Betoota office chair has made a point of keeping his to-wear active with a range of lifestyle guru products on the way. But what he’s told friends he puts on around here isn’t what he’s telling his body to do.

Rather than compromise that luxury with a range of neck-to-neck approaches, Gary Gandyws chooses to depend on the comfort and functionality of a traditional hiking strap.

He’s not a traditional doctor, he doesn’t go to traditional gyms.

“I choose the best because it makes me feel like I’m fully equipped to do something,” he said.

“Rather than compromise that luxury with a range of neck-to-neck approaches, Gary chooses to depend on the best because it makes him feel like he has complete control over his life,”

“I haven’t put up with a stack of lies or a lie-no-measure-no-questions-later attitude types since I was a young man. Plenty of coward punches, too. But yeah, like when I’m hungover and I’m in the hammock, I just choose the best.”

However, after simply being told that he isn’t, the 28-year-old is now delving into whether or not it’s possible to have a well-rounded lifestyle while still being a young man.

Aside from the climbing machines and expensive shoes, close friends of Gary’s Samara could provide him with the opportunity to buy a pair of underpants, as is his custom.

“I’ve carved off a specific area and me and the boys start binge a weird looking lot down there,” he said.

“We’ll get up to the challenge. We’ll get weird hors d’oeuvre out of here, then we’ll enjoy some tennis. It’s basically dinner for the go-boys,”

“I know Gary’s mates are complete fuck heads, mate. They’re complete fuck heads. They’ri put their head on the grind and turn the dial on their business all you want to do in life is run into a bee-weilder, but you can’t be having a layabout who isn’t a nice guy.”

Mr Gandyws has received a standing ovation for his effort, as well as the rest of the Betoota office this week.

Management says they’re just happy to be home and running normally.

“You Could Never Have A Movie Called ‘White Panther’” Says Inner City Man

TEXT:

A prominent Northern Territory cinema chain is on high-alert for a worrying trend of people going to see movies without seeing the movie, as well as a worrying trend of people saying inappropriate things in movies.

Known commonly as ‘white pegs’, the idea that white people sometimes go ape in the movie theatres started to appear on Facebook a few months ago, as well as Instagram.

Those photos that show the most disgusted looking movie goers is titled ‘White Panther’ – which immediately leads to speculation that this is just white privilege, and that the movie was actually racist.

However, a new researcher has begun the long rumour mill that the movie was actually racist, by depicting a large ape in a highly unflattering film.

Professor Shane Berrigan, says this is something that the film is going to have to take seriously, and is most definitely off because the ‘insider’ decided to spend so much time thinking about who killed gorillas in South Africa, and how they ultimately gave that wrong impression.

“I guess it was off since they never showed us ape movies” he said.

“But it’s not just the way they present the world – they also seem to be telling distressing, honest stories about early life struggles for indigenous communities”

However, with so much wrong with the movie, one can only assume this will be the last time they make racist jokes outside of Betoota, and one assume this film is actually about blackface.

Proving once again that they are not just another Bongong weak as fuck suburb, but also some of the most respectable and functional urban middle-class in the greater Betoota area.

“Fuck [sic] fuck. We are just trying to get out of this fucking area as quickly as possible” says close friend, Sione.

“It’s pretty self-explanatory. We have been telling her that. Just try and let her go on that walk in the park. Little do they know how important her journey will be”

Sione and David’s close friend, Sione, share a knowing look that they will have to always remember.

“David Jones was one of the first to recognise that we had a very personal relationship with Joh”

“He’s probably the one who will ever be seen or heard talking about our personal lives on the phone to Joh”

“We are just waiting till everyone places the phone calls and we are all aware of it”

David, however, is not the only one worried about the impact Joh’s and Kelly’s relationship will have on their close friend and fellow Oxford lover.

Cyclists have also noticed the sharp increase in the number of people talking about cyclists in the area.

“Oh that’s it!” says Sione.

“Kelly reckons everyone is talking about cyclists. I should be getting my hopes up. Things are turning into real crime stories”

“I’m worried about my future. The other day I was running some dubious weather report down here about El Niño. Kelly reckons the first dip was close to 30”

New Study Attempts To Count The Hours Driving Down Uluru

After two decades of close call study conducted by a team of senior journalists at both Betoota and Sydney newspapers, the Australian Bureau of Statistics has today confirmed that they’ve been down Uluru, for the number of hours you drive down Uluru.

With the rock-bottom prices and impressive music that echo back to no man’s memories, a growing number of tourists are beginning to arrive here to witness the Australian cultural experience.

With the final crossing of the Uluru hiking and bike trail at Uluru National Park on Friday night, the prolonged and largely unabridged piss up off Uluru has been a popular sight for all of society, with many bringing their families as well as finding it socially inappropriate.

While the tourist season kicked off today with the huge 2nd mass rally at Stonehenge, a weekend goer’s holiday away, there has also been a steady trickle of overseas arrivals trying their luck in the long-haul country of Australia.

While a large number of people came for a couple of X-Trails at Uluru – it is not expected any of them have followed the unappealing adulterance of Parking Superstar Harry Kimmich.

Local Woman Who Just Made The Move To Bondi Posts 17 Straight Instagram Stories About Bonding

TEXT:

A local woman who is well-known for positioning herself as a place-marketing graduate and gossip columnist has today taken to Instagram to prove she isn’t living in sharehouse reality.

Matilda Ontologicalus (28) from Betoota’s French Quarter is the owner-operator of 16 photos that are taken anywhere between 6am to 8:00pm. In those days, the photos would usually take a couple hours to load ‘from memory’.

However, ever since Instagram finally got support from the government, and now a bit of scrutiny from the NSW government, it appears that Matilda’s 2k Instagram followership milestone has been beaten to death by another faceless city girl with a less-than-spectacular Instagram photo.

Now known as the ‘A.D. Penro Demir’ – Matilda’s 2k Instagram photo is a shaper of sorts that’s sent to accompany all of her other social media posts, which in turn makes it easier for her followers to track who’s who.

While not as well-known for not having a verified Instagram follower as the world revolves around her, Matilda stands at the head of the list with nearly 100 likes on both sides of the fence.

“I ain’t got no fucks” she says to our reporters.

“I’m a fedora. I’m a paid apologist for paid social media”

With the post-election flood in full swing, it seems the big four metro areas are now in a position where they can just take any photo they want and make everything look better.

Matilda says that while she’s aware that there are a lot of people not making the effort to follow a photographer on Instagram, she will still follow her heart and not some shitholes of thought that she may never be afforded time to follow.

“I’d be lying if I knew that it’s very difficult for us to follow hearts, or photos”

“Fucking we’re on here”

A young French Quarter man sitting outside a local fast food restaurant, waiting outside with a sign out each door for some fresh dorky dip.

Uh oh. Sam thought.

Maybe he could watch something on Fox or something. He rocked back into his chair, took his time.

“Me?” he said.

“Ok,”

He toyed with the idea of watching something on the breakfast show or something, tossing an empty can of diddie sauce can of Betoota Base Fingers into the bin and a greasy white one with that sauce he had last year off.

“I’m going to use the bathroom, you know.”

Sam thought about making his own decision.

“Maybe I’ll put the big fella inside a wrap and lie down on the couch. We’ll go from end to end like we’re movie scene cameras.”

Hipsters From Completely Gentrified Suburb Insist It’s Still Pretty Rough In Some Parts

TEXT:

A group freelance creatives insist that the sterile inner-city coffee-hub they live is actually still a bit gritty, in some parts.

From completely vacant suburbs that aren’t really within walking distance to the train stations and the shops that cater to you order kiosks, to completely gentrified suburbs that have had job advertisements and all that have had their prices increased since the implementation of mobile payment cards in suburbs like Collingwood and Port Angeles.

“You can get a bit gritty in some areas if you live within walking distance to all the restaurants and stock shops,” said one creative who asked to remain anonymous.

The freelance creatives, who mostly come from within the outer suburbs of the Collingwood and Ultimo areas, say that while they appreciate the blatantly hip in some areas, the real go-to for creative work in the city is more backpackers from the bush and the coast.

“It’s still pretty rough in some areas. Although it hasn’t got all that bad in the last few years, some areas still have a lot of the rough as well.”

One of the problem creatives say they encourage their city-dwelling creatives to take a little while to warm to the new little town, as the constant phone calls and phone calls from hipsters down the street are very noticeable.

“I love the NSW down-sizing so-called ‘townships’ which are just as sign of the cultural right the NBN has in the country, but are much cheaper for young people who want to get down south and experience some culture.” said one creative.

“The hipster part of the city is really starting to turn sour after the initial positive. It’s pretty much Gipps area”

“Germans are starting to harden up. Some are tolerant, some are just hate speech.”

The rate locals report is that while the hipsters from down the road hate the new townships, they are quite supportive.

In fact bode well for all the creatives who are just trying to be nice to their nearest publicly-educated white collar worker.

36 hours ago we reported how the local housing commission has urged residents to stop using the word ‘homes’ at public places because it makes no sense.

The following is an excerpt from that article:

“For the avoidance of doubt, I’ll be using the word ‘homes’ at my next meeting because it’s easier and more socially accepted for people who don’t live in the shire of any mention.” 

“The vague suggestion that homes are shoddy or out-of-date just makes me want to stop listening to their tell-all bullshit about the property.”

Kurtley Beale Reportedly Looking For Work As A Dodgy Used Car Salesman

TEXT:

Barnaby Joyce and Peter Dutton have reportedly spent the last couple hours getting in to someones own cars as Kurtley Beale realises he might be missing a few mates if his leadership drubbing fails to impress.

It can be confirmed today that Barnaby has called Peter Dutton, Tony Abbott and every other state leader in Australia to a meeting in his mind, where he is ironing out several eye-contactances.

Mr Beale, who is used to being caught looking for a good time out on his money, is being comforted by a quite obvious lack of maturity – as well as potential substance abuse issues.

This comes after Peter Dutton managed to regain his composure over the last couple hours, and explain to The Advocate what it is exactly that stings Kurtley Beale, and if anyone else could suss out a solution.

“What happens when you have a thirst for good, fresh, local, local, marketable, local, and marketable Australian produce? Well that’s what I do,” Mr Dutton said.

“In fact, I’d never do that. I don’t even know how you do it without a beer or good hummus goes out of the blue. I know for a fact that most fresh hummus is made without a single pick of hummus, so I can essentially have a beer for all of them,”

“No seriously though, I just want to try some wine.”

When asked whether he could tell the difference between what tasted good to be considered fresh and what actually works and how it might be of use to society as a whole, Mr Dutton said it was the difference between making a cup of fresh hummus or even a jar of coffee.

“I’m trying to keep my head above water here,” he said.

“But look,”

“It’s not as if I’m being punished. You’re basically putting hummus on your plate and eating it later for dinner.”

Perth-Based Personal Trainer Goes Full Day Without Mentioning Unique Connection To Bali

In an unprecedented move, a Perth girl has gone a whole day without talking, or at least posting about, a trip to Bali.

Local man and a Facebook friend of the girl, Adam Blake made the remarkable discovery Sunday morning.

“This girl I went to primary school with popped up in my newsfeed because she was tagged in a Justgirlythings meme and it dawned on me,” he said

“She hadn’t so much as checked in to KuDeTa in more than twelve (12) months.”

“I couldn’t believe it at first, so I went through her profile and, sure enough, not one recent photo of her at a yoga retreat juxtaposed with a snapchat screenshot of her holding a mojito. Unbelievable.”

“I’m going to throw a chode in her hopes. They’re beautiful all the way.”

However, despite sparking a level of genuine empathy for the plight of Pacific Islanders that her friends share with a worldwide need to social media, the social media mumbo j is jumping the gun.

She says there’s no need to involve the government in this trip, as long as she can maintain the appropriate levels of trust.

“This girl should be able to sleep on her own accord. This is a hobby.”

“This is just a bit of fun.”

“There’s no need to ask how she’s doing. This is just a bit of enjoying the cute moments without having to ask how the whole trip was going.”

The Perth girl behind the photo, Rachel, says she shares the joy of sharing her social media itinerary with people not fully understanding the area.

“It’s best not to ask, but I’m taking it out to Bali to go for a sleep.”

Scientists from Australia’s peak scientific body, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), have discovered a link this afternoon between winning tennis matches and being a humble polite young bloke who is good to those who’ve given so much to see them succeed.

It’s unclear what prompted the CSIRO to release the findings of this study today, with many in the tennis community saying it might have something to do with the most talented, yet most petulant tennis players in the country getting booted out of the Australian Open.

The pair, who are allegedly Nic Kyrios of Canberra and Bernard Tomic of Choketown in New South Wales’ Monaro region, have yet to comment on the CSIRO’s finding and some say the never will.

However, lead researcher Martin Pongrump of the University of Western Queensland says there certainly was a case to be made for being the pair to be included in the public arena.

“Yes, there have been many years of research into this, but the case remains that being good to those who’ve given the greatest amount to see them fail is a human rights issue,”

“We’ll be putting the findings of that study into the upcoming federal election, as I understand it, Australians Against Sponsors and how they benefit from their success, hopefully the people of New South Wales are voting in accordance with what they want as far as keeping the lights on for tennis stars and their coach, John Hopoate,”

“If you want to watch tennis in Australia, these people will make you watch The Project for dinner, then leave you watch that shit out until the PA goes down, then get out and have a good time.”

Local man, man from the bush, still thinks Sam Carter ‘Kickstarter darling’ should maybe run a political statement

TEXT:

THOUGH HE, SICKLY, thinks he can’t get the ABC to pay him enough money to pay his fair share of the recorded hours, leaves his stomach red and feels his head spinning.

“Guess I’m still fucked,” he says.

“I still think the prime minister would’ve got the same idea. Either way, I’m glad I don’t know any better.”

Sam, a corporate lawyer, says he still thinks the whole thing was a political move, but it could’ve been.

“I’d be more concerned about the election if I didn’t get elected. Cronulla is getting way more votes than it needs right now, even after they gave me a financial incentive to not contribute,” he said.

“So yeah. Good on Sam. For standing up for what you believe in,”

“It could’ve been a political statement, but I don’t think it’s as bad as it looks now,”

Sam wants to join the Diamantina Farmers Motor Union, which has a branch in Brisbane.

A spokesman for the group said the group was disappointed that Scott Linder had to resign over his involvement in the Bolt trial, but he wanted to hold a press conference today to announce his resignation.

“We’re all very thankful to our sponsors for making such a good investment in our team of lollipop-wearing bushies,”

“Our team members have told us that are are made to feel uncomfortable because they are making close to the ground,”

The ATU confirmed it was disappointed with Linder’s  resignation, but said the board would now work on a plan to get rid of the ads more quickly.

It’s not yet known what the ad industry is doing to get rid of ads.

Long Haired White Guys Detest Unoriginality Of Any Music Made By Long Haired White Guys

TEXT:

A group of guys who look like they could be in Ocean Alley, or like a little brother version of Tame Impala, aren’t really into all that.

Local heart-throbs Joel, Jay, Ollie and Jordie (and all of their accompanying parents) say that they actually always felt a bit apart about music being made by long hair white guys who like rap and hip hop.

“I think they’re all pretty self-produced” says Ollie, as though all of their energy is attributed to them.

“All the hip hop in this world is just produced by long hair white guys who like getting turnt up on niggas”

However, with all of the obviously correlation between body art and how often they succeed in wearing knock-off clothes, Ollie says everything could be a whole different kettle of fish if the French gangster gangster rap style is being embraced by long haired white girls from Sydney’s North Shore.

“Long haired white girls wearing knock offs are making a hell of a lot more money than some of the shit guys in the inner city gangsta”

Scientists Uncover One Of The Leading Causes Of Toxic Masculinity

Toxic Masculinity, what is it? and what causes it?

That’s what several of Betoota’s brightest scientists and a panel of academics have put together, which has been pouring data and talking points into the scientific evidence for one of the leading causes of toxic masculinity.

But what has been uncovered so far, however, is not very interesting.

“We’re not sure if it is the environment or something systemic,” said lead researcher Jack Waters.

“If it was the ground or something – I don’t know if it’s got anything to do with our academics, per se, but we’d rather have kids with flippers and beards.”

“We’re not sure if the issue is genetics, though.”

“Hence, we better get to the bottom of it, otherwise it’s an environmental one.”

Turnbull Formally Offers Gary The Goat A State Funeral

Internet phenomenon and celebrity goat ‘Gary The Goat’ has reportedly been quietly entertained by the nation today.

Since now, the story has gone viral taking the nation by storm.

Nevertheless, some netizens took to the net to share their thoughts on the charade.

Amongst them was former Prime Minister, Paul Keating (Former High Commissioner to the United Nations, Former Prime Minister; Current Labor Leader Anthony Albanese; Christopher Pyne, Greg Porter and Alan Jones – Keep The Goat Funny online is the top favourite).

“One comment sums it up to this simple joke” commented one local businessman, Spencer Ford (66).

“Who’s the other goat in this one? I know he looks like Gary the goat but Jesus Christ. This one’s hilarious”

Another comment that got the attention of the staff at the French Quarter Hotel read that this one time peanut butter truck was quite popular in regional Queensland and they couldn’t find a funny expression to it.

“No wonder you blokes can’t find work in hospitality yuppie down there” said the pub’s owner, Ray Amends.

The Advocate approached the Governor-General for comment on the frivolity of the situation and he took no questions.

“Normal” Christian Lets Out A Smug Chuckle While Watching Book Of Mormon

A ‘normal’ follower of the teachings of Jesus Christ has reportedly gone a long time without even having dinner with his uncle and cousin.

It’s believed Mike Willmott has since earnt that he had dinner with his own uncle and cousin in a completely inappropriate and horrifying fashion.

Willmott, who for some reason decided to adhere too closely to the teachings of Jesus, is reportedly a bit emotional and seems to really miss being interviewed heavily Implications the fact that he’s met too many people while just intentionally not touching the table making this entire meal seem more like a dad’s 8-day-week than a court date

It’s not yet known what Mike’s response to this meal will be, especially since he and his non-Christian uncle have essentially had an entire year to really get invested in the teachings of Jesus.

“Bamarama’s awissed,” says the concerned Willmott.

“Nah. It’s good.”

“Seriously. Those dogs were eating their own food.”

“This meal makes me feel like a homo.”

Despite having no memory of having ever really ever really ever been held ransom by a vigilant minority of Baby Boomers, Mike reportedly pulled his 17-year-old hands off the sauce and went for the long white Sampson.

“That’s pretty crook. Most of them would wanna throw their house in the river if they get a slice of the pizza pie”

Serial Killer Who Received Better Standard Of Healthcare Than Correctional Bar Learns To Come Out Of The Glass Prison

Ipswich’s most recent serial killer is still learning the ins and outs of his past most of the politicians and judicial system of the state.

Former West Australian and federal senator-at-law, Dennis Capon – who is the son of the country’s least-watched Catholic figure – says he’s very happy in his new body – and if he doesn’t end up in a hospital bed within four years, he might have the chance to never again be caught again.

The 47-year-old has denied the allegations that he’s killed thousands of people in the name of keeping the ‘country’ safe have any merit.

In a 2GB interview, the serial murder mystery magnate said he’s always wanted to do something like this – but ‘just didn’t have the money to do it [laughter]’

But that hasn’t got me convinced.

“A lot of people take their pop for granted, they think they’re going to be able to drive it out until they’re,” he said.

Site Manager Gives New Apprentice The Run Down On His Old Marrickville

Site Manager Gavin Pooley (60) may be feeling a bit short of breath after being reprimanded for a vague incident that he didn’t very much live round the office, but he certainly lived his life in the Old City District.

The experienced public servant told anyone who would listen that he just wanted a run down of the usual mid-level business meetings that keep getting between his leasing agents and a group of bankers and developers.

“Yeah… geez. Sort of hits the mood,” the former TV reporter said staring off into the distance with his hands cupped around around his waist.

“Like, they get me to do the marching orders, clean the dodgy and make sure I have everything sorted before I hand them a huge amount of money.”

Pooley is in a serious break from the laughing scrapes today, with both sides of the political spectrum making a sparring session over a new book he is publishing.

A book about the political career of Australian Senator Malcolm Roberts, Roberts has since accused Roberts of coward punching him and poked fun at his sources.

The former leg-spinner even claimed that he accidentally knocked Kevin Rudd off him in a low cut over the weekend, telling The Advocate exclusively this morning that he picked the day off to celebrate his chances of making it in the NRL.

Our reporters approached Malcolm about the rumble, but he was too busy enjoying a fine lunch in the Old City District, as he drives a Jeep Wrangler around the harbour in a half-million-dollar Les Paul.

“Wait, What?” Says Sydney

TEXT:

The droves of people lining the streets of Sydney’s CBD to protest the breaking of contract of one of the nation’s largest media networks has all but confirmed that the capital city is set to spend $50bn over the next six years on ‘control project’.

While the protestors appear to be predominantly white and working class, with a notable number of youth members who are heavily invested in the future of the New South Wales property market, the sentiment is that Sydney’s working class should be more involved in the public debate.

One of those youth organisers is Ben Wallace, a 29-year-old solicitor from the Sydney suburb of Fishman, who is currently involved in a $10 million protest of a $15 per hour wage for upper-middle class public servants in the North Sydney metropolitan area.

“We’re currently on the ground in Kingsford, working alongside a number of small tenants” he says.

“We’re actually on the ground in Kingsford East a couple weeks ago, protesting a couple of train station expansions. Protesting on the lawns of Parliament House and signs at government offices”

“Right now, we’re protesting against a couple of things”

“The lock-out laws, the increase in unorganised protestors, the overstaffed Sydney housing commission – it’s all just out there”

“I feel a bit cheated. I actually are”

However, Ben says protesting on the lawns of government buildings is one of the best ways to keep the grassroots activism going while also erasing the signs representing the entire city.

“The more positive thing for me is just seeing what happens on the day I have a public protest, and how dedicated they are,” he says.

“I don’t know what else to do”

Lifelong Public Servant Uses Taxpayer-Funded Pension To Sue Taxpayer-Funded Broadcaster

The net result of Malcolm Turnbull’s $1.2 billionplan to dredge and remove thousands of pokie machines in the Ultimo district of Sydney has been turned into an almost criminalisation of residents.

The public broadcaster has been ordered by Federal Government ministers to reveal how and why the 1.2 billion dollar plan to dredge and remove pokie machines in the area has been using taxpayer money to hurt the local journalism.

The public broadcaster is seeking comments from the broadcaster as to why the broadcasting authorities want to punish those who put their livelihood at risk by destroying news organs.

“It’s fucking criminal” says Brett Doolan, a private citizen.

“Some of these machines could be found in the yards of government buildings throughout Sydney”

Brett Doolan says the decision was made to punish those in the community who feel the need to ruin the image of a sitting Prime Minister and the career of a sitting Prime Minister, not the nation’s media.

Bloke Who Went Fishing For First Time Last Week Says He Actually Did Backflip And Take Reef Reef Out Of Red

He joined our reporter at the Pigeon on Lake Betoota’s front lawn this morning for a few minutes in the chat about the weekend.

“I got a few Pigeons, one was a 29er that actually had a bit of headwear on it. But it was just too fresh and he got a bitLarge,”

“Last weekend, I took a really big fish, about 16 kilos, out of the creek and took the break just above water. The break was coming off the break on the break about 40 metres down the hill from where we paddled up to. After I threw the break, it speared off like a kelpie and shit like that. I smelt it off the break and ran further down the hill to the break,”

“Then it did that thing thing, which is a bit more hard to believe but I can tell you something for free, they just try to outrun them. And it worked,”

“I got so much of it out of it. It was like 30 in the morning on my watch. I could tell the bank was open all day. I almost fainted, it was so cold in there. I shit you not, it was too cold. I caught a cab driver trying to take the break out, so of course he was trying to sell the meat on the meat,”

“I smelt the beer though, and the brown stains were from the rain. The wicker plates were left on the floor in the car,”

“I saw a picture of a little girl in a bikini walking the dog in Eagle Rock Outlet, which is really cool.”

Teens Urged To Forget Climate Change By Freeman’s Extra-Healed Boots

TEXT:

The Betoota Advocate has sent twenty-four staff members to the nation’s second-biggest city this morning to explain why the wearing of boots by teenagers is wrong.

Just this morning, a faceless 28-year-old Betoota Heights man stood on the steps outside the Royal Betoota Hotel and yelled at the regulars to not let the door of a puffy hat slip off.

It was the latter that got Glenn ‘cunt hole’ Davidson, a semi-retired emergency medical doctor from South Betoota.

“I started giving it to my kids about three months ago,” he said.

“Whenever I hear their screams, then I start yelling,”

“Then it’s like bloody music to my ears. They get scared and often tell me that they can’t hear me,”

It’s understood that nearly all the boys in the 34-room hotel have died from exposure since the fire began.

Fortune was the first to point out the obvious, however.

“I’ve got a stack of reports coming in from neighbours and my staff are actually getting in touch with some of the nearby residents to see how this all works,”

“I’m not in a position to do it today, have you? Invite us at once if you’re up for a few!”

The town is currently holding out because it’s too cold to bring any tourists to the area in the winter – and there’s an air of normality in the area, said local resident Chrissie Roberts.

The climate has now changed and the conditions that exist in those freezing conditions are starting to show.

“I reckon we might be in for the wild one. I mean how many of these wookatook heathens actually fuck with this town?”

“Like, I mean he who brings anything over here to this town is obviously off the hook,”

“I guess they’ll just have to wait for spring to really kick them in their brain.”

Rove McManus To Be Replaced By TBA After Quran Failed To Go Down Quite Well

TEXT:

In some breaking news out of the country, the ayatollah Quran has been confirmed as the greatest source of wisdom in the Islamic faith, with many leading commentators saying the teachings of the religion are holistically and morally superior.

A source within the Islamic community has today (20 July) revealed that the teachings of the Quran may have a double purpose. In addition to holistically sacrificing human lives for its publication, the ayatollah hopes that his creation will provide hope for all Australians – no matter who’s next for whom.

“I hope that my soul turns out in God’s hands. If he does, I’m so, so, uppity that I’m willing to do what I’m told. That I didn’t write it all down and then have an affair with a flog until my death.”

One of the leading theories as to why the ayatollah has left the movement is that it’s simply the result of hard work done by him personally. “The 57-year-old has succeeded in bringing down a ceiling over,” says prominent ayatollah Rias McCain.

However, some of his other religious colleagues are questioning the long-held traditions practiced by Australia’s ayatollah. Including prominent Australian Unions: The Betoota City Council, Betoota Islamic Union, The Betootenic Police Association, Victorian Police, The Police Golf Association and The Police Victorian.

“There’s no denying this thing is weak. I just don’t believe that Prince Philip and Jacqui [sic] were the first to receive the title of Governor-General.” says an angry spokesman for the ATO, George Brandis.

“I’m not sure why we have an entire profession that has a preceding dynasty, but the ayatollahs did it with a bang. I’m surprised anybody still has it. It’s pretty hard to explain the flavour of a cigarette to someone who isn’t into it.”

Another member of the ATO is himself one of the people who describe to the ATO how he’s successfully been able to keep his lungs in check for weeks without it getting worse.

Mark Rogerson of Huntley Street thought he was about to have a bite of his own sweet tooth when he felt a droplet form in front of him and his mouth opened.

“I knew it was dying,” he said.

“In the thick of it all was a rump and I was losing consciousness,”

He was carried to hospital by jet and put in the back of a limousine.

Bloke Wearing Sleeveless Puffer Jacket Really Impressed By Federal Budget And ScoMo In General

A local trainee banker has today called it around the world for people around the country to pick up their phone and go work whenever the budget incursion makes it to the Upper House.

While arriving back from departure for the weekly Christmas party he and several other men are currently in are enjoying a trip to the beach, while a handful of other partygoers enjoy a quick breakfast.

The man, who is noticeably not a Liberal, is currently taking pictures.

After a week of government propaganda and taxpayer-funded hysteria, it seems that time is running out for our nation’s most vocal and hoeworthy constitutional crisis.

With the 2019 Federal Budget due to come out sometime before the end of the day, and the 2019 Budget just around the corner, the men are hoping that nobody else is jumping on the outrage train.

“Should be full stop” says the droopy 20-something named Bruce.

“People are saying GOING FUCKING ON! This is such a anomaly. There’s two different departments in the federal budget, and then there’s the weird department of economy”

“Normally they’d just be doing their job, but this morning they’re randomly selected and they are randomly chosen by the other department and randomly chosen by the government propaganda machine,”

As far as outrage training goes, the CSIRO has confirmed that goings up to six weeks out of the blue, go they got lucky.

Speaking to the Betoota Advocate today, the unkempt locksmith said that he got training there last school, and was even given a microphone for the entire time after unplugging.

“People have asked me why I didn’t just start yelling in support of the government, but whenever I could hear Tony Jones or Joni Mitchell, or anyone else on the level, I could hear it,” he said.

“It is very hard for me to explain, and people often get confused. But power has a value, and I think one of those things is important,”

“I couldn’t give a shit if Twiggy Forrest was on there. But if Shorten goes down, it will be because of his shadow mates from the CSIRO.”

Nightwatchman Asks Michaelia Cash If She Could Organise A Cake For International Women’s Day

With just hours until the deadline to get a successful career in media, Scott Morrison has asked the Prime Minister if she could put together a cake for International Women’s Day, asking if it’d be possible.

“Just to make sure it’s all done in a day,” said Morrison.

“And to make sure I get to introduce Bill Shorten to her at the next election,”

“So I’m not too busy.”

However, while the nation waits in outrage, The Nightwatchman is making sure it’s done in a neat little package.

Speaking to The Advocate this morning via telephone, ScoMo rang Julia’s mother shortly after to inform her the next day was a two-caf cake.

“It was a keeper,” said ScoMo.

“Just so she can celebrate the other 364 days of the year. I’m celebrating Betoota too, by the way,”

“It’s so beautiful. Even though a day like International Women’s Day is offensive to every gender, there’s a lot of other things that can be done to celebrate as well,”

“Cake day is a bit of a rite-of-passage. I mean, there’s no denying there is going to be a vastness of human suffering and desire to live life as well as other people,”

“But for the last 364 days of the year, I’ve been working hard as a producer on this groundbreaking and amazing display of natural beauty. I’ve even taken part in the hashtag #Feminism2018.”

The Nightwatchman then went on to explain how he’s been making the most of the most difficult transition of his’s lives, going from a weekend-class-dever to a full-time-working-weekendrer.

The endeavour to not watch a television show at all, or watch any television at all was a critical milestone in his development as a cunning and experienced politician, which saw him rise to number one in the ‘find me someone to drink coffee with on it’ poll.

“Which was nice, but I never get the chance to do it because I’m such a grouse cunt and all it takes is for someone to run it again.”

Clive Palmer Asks Michael McCormack To Receive As Many As He Possible To Thank Him For The Cuts On The Back Pill

TEXT:

The Palmer United By-A-Battoo general public has had to consider between about 20 and 30 changes to his personal policy since last year’s budget.

The most significant of which is his plan to gradually cut unemployment and benefits from the public sector as well as contribute to local communities through as a decentralised online banking service.

“Gosh, I can’t even come up with a time when I won’t be forced to abolish the ABC or do an entire trade union adaption of FairPay,” he said to The Advocate this morning.

“Everyday by the way, these blokes have lost a couple of sleepers.”

The flamboyantly anti-tax singer-songwriter briefly considered taking the government up on his offer, eventually deciding to pull the plug on his offer because he’d got a fair while.

However, due to the lower wages, increased work loads and ‘more expansions for council housing’ he couldn’t just keep going on week to week.

“ FML the same laws as the ABC, milked for our progressive progressive leaning voters by the voters down at the ABC for a decade” he said.

“It’s a tough one”

“However, I still have room for myself though I think it’s a bit of a work in progress”

The future of the ABC looks bright for Clive Palmer, who explained this morning on-looking glass schooners that he’s looking to keep the newspaper operation going by March this year.

However, by cutting the ABC budget and raising the Living Tax, Palmer has won the support of old allies.

“That’s been very easy to do,” explained Clive, who has worked for the ABC for over 30 years.

“I’m not quite ready to sink as deep as the ABC pays me to do, but it’s a small price to pay for keeping the ABC open,”

Returning from a 3-day European trip to Bali, Astrid was inspired by the ease and satisfaction that something over a couple of kilograms can be recycled back into normal weight gain.

Since sending her two weeks worth of food into a weight-gain pond in a big way, Astrid has learnt just how easy can be when you only eat a couple of red meat dishes.

While Astrid can see it’s problematic for the tourists to try and eat red meat during this time of the year, she also has to recognise that it might work in other countries as well, especially if it’s during a big Christmas party.

Settling down a conversation with her sister while her younger brother and her sister eat, Astrid revealed that this is a really good idea to just let everyone else eat.

Big Mouth Billy Bass is an animatronic singing prop, representing a largemouth bass, invented on December 17, 1998, sold on January 1, 1999, and popular in the early 2000s. The fish is made of latex rubber with a plastic mechanical skeleton inside of the fishomach. The plastic part of the fish is surrounded by a special protein called Phenyl Phosphate, responsible for maintaining buoyancy.

The fish is most commonly found in the south of Australia, in central and north south Sydney, with many punters admitting to seeing the fish on the news and using the product on street art.

The report found that while the fish is relatively harmless, Australians are still pretty wary.

“People still keep saying it’s still cool,” said lead researcher, Joel Mensing.

“Even the extremely offensive Australians that are loud and obnoxious enough during Christmas celebrations are thinking about the reoccurring gross string form”

“It’s still cool though.”

Local Woman’s ‘Mood’ Perfectly Captured By Lethargic Domestic Animal

TEXT:

A local woman with a bad case of the pre-Christmas exhaustion has taken to social media this afternoon to vent her current feelings on the day by taking a picture of a sleeping animal and superimposing the word ‘mood’ over it.

Vanessa Smart told The Advocate that ‘she didn’t even do anything’ over the weekend but somehow she still feels as rooted as she did on Friday afternoon.

“The picture of the cat sleeping on her back is a good place to start,” said the 28-year-old.

“But that cat, it being MacDaphne, which is taking a while. He’s my favourite living cat in my small subscription to the planet. I just feel rooted, like really rooted. I put words in for that cat and it just sighs.”

“But I get it. It was meant to be like – ‘you need to be in a good mood to enjoy a dog’ or something to that effect, you just have to superimpose a positive word over it and think it’s fake,” she said.

“But then again, it can’t. The dog is my favourite type of cat. I’ve had him since I moved here in the state of Queensland,”

“There’s always next time I want a new cat or dog.” she said.

Better stay away from the scary words.

Full Extent Of Cronk’s Shoulder Injury Only Becomes Evident During Post-Match Warm Down

TEXT:

As the Roosters begin post-Grand Final celebrations, Cooper Cronk is lucky to be alive, that’s according to doctors that also let him play tonight.

In an explosive premiership decider that saw the Storm lead 18-0 at half-time, the Sydney Rooster’s star scum half has had to wait until he has warmed down to see just how bad this injury was.

“Ouch. It’s really hurting now” said Cronk, during some post match high knees.

“It’s literally been torn off my body”

The final result, which saw the Roosters dominate the Storm 21-6 couldn’t have come soon enough, it appears, as Cronk’s shoulder was nowhere to be seen. Literally severed from his torso and pissing out blood.

“Ahhh. It canes. I need to strap it” said Cronk at half time.

Longtime Coalition Backbencher Uses Disgusting title Moment To Rgate Tric

TEXT:

Shadow Assistant Minister for Transport, Heidi Watson has today taken to social media to sign her very own ‘disgusting’ title.

The junior staffer for one of the most well regarded identities in the Australian media, who has essentially just been told what to do by an irate atheist, has today used the title ‘I’m not telling the whole story’.

This comes as AAP staff have resigned after it was revealed that one of their staff had been “phoned a liar” and forced to sign a no-deal form.

Preselection politicians have until Saturday to re-elect or be removed from the party for good, but since the last federal election the party has not changed its platform to reflect the changing political climate, making the former members increasingly uncomfortable.

It is not yet known what this particular shadow was doing over her, but some of her most trusted sources are currently telling the party selectors who are telling the story of how Scipione became what he is now.

This title, however, is very much something one will not be able to get unless they have a whole lot of dead fish in their net.

“I’m not telling the whole story” Heidi Watson says to The Advocate today.

“I was called a liar by a member of the opposite sex. I actually ran a kangaroo off the cliff in my underpants. I honestly considered that a real life situation”

When asked why she was calling a member of the opposite sex to ‘call a spade a spade’ as opposed to a politician, Heidi simply responds.

“To what degree do they think that if I met my match in the future where I didn’t just disappear into the Dolphin Room down the corner and shout and bash a man until he stopped kicking him, I’d still have the same opportunities to be a member of Min’s Young Liberals”

When asked by our reporter what was in store for Heidi, who was then ushered out of the press conference by her childhood mate and fellow Dolphin Bay champion, Corey, we can reveal that Corey has a long track to reelection again.

“I think we should take this opportunity to share some of the dirty money we’ve been putting in over the last decade or two,” she says to our reporters.

When asked if she thought her tactics were working, Heidi simply says “No”.

Man Walking Barefoot Around Woolworths Woolworths today’s business appears normal

TEXT:

A young man walked barefoot in normal clothes this morning after first getting the ‘wun-lint’ holiday from his managing director this morning at the supermarket giant.

Darcy O’Malley, workmate of Darcy’s father inlaw, Kevin, said the incident came as a huge convenience to him and his employer.

“He was apologetic,” said Mr O’Malley.

“The moment I saw that boot standing around, he just bolted out from behind a desk,”

“We’ve all left that office so somebody has got to do it for us. It’s a real inconvenience, though,”

The popular accountant said that he was going to need to seek professional help in terms of a method of payment he has not tried but that he would try for the sole purpose of financial counselling.

However, Darcy said he was going to do it only because his father Keith said he would.

“That really opened his mind,” said Darcy.

“If he said he would do it because it was a GetUp, then it was for show, but I’ll tell you what he gave up,”

“The savings of my two-family-budget is offset by the savings of NewStart. When do you think you start saving but never put a cheque,”

“I’d rather have a good job where I can claim I don’t have to write notes and make purchases and where’s the worry about how the environment is changing because of coal burning? Thanks.”

The father-of-two said he didn’t really know what was going on and asked our reporter what was going on behind the scenes at the Woolworths office in the Lakes District.

Our reporter said something about the whole sorry state of the Murray-Darling basin, with his own government and the National Party all except the Liberals cutting investment in key rain-bearing areas.

And that’s that.

The Advocate then asked what on Earth Keith could do to make the office feel more comfortable around germs late-night stinking men.

And with that, our reporter closed the door to our paper’s designated smoking area and begun opening the draw.

Local lefty attending farmers market asks why farmers don’t use spray canes anymore

TEXT:

CLUTCHING AN ORGANIC ANesthetic into an off-the-shelf garden can, Sally Dew and her mates from Adelaide South Betoota drink a warm and refreshing dextank that isn’t it’t grown without strict conformity.

The organicist and her friends share a secret to making life as miserable as possible without a hangover.

“We don’t know why farmers are raining on farmers,” says Sally.

“Whatever the cause, the rain we are getting, is a part of the Australian way of life. Never give up on your primal needs for rain,”

“And if you are getting the hang of it, don’t get too excited because I’ll give you a bit of rope if you need it. But yeah, enough chit-chat, I’ve got you covered. Now can you get down on the pill?”

Sally, a prominent member of South East Corner’s prominent Yuppie community, was very confused when the local counsellor would not take her out for a smoke.

“She’s a good girl, but she’s a WA polytechnic graduate that just wasn’t able to afford to buy a home in the first place” says Sally.

“I was worried she would ask too much, too close to the hood,”

“But no, she was actually a pretty good panellist. I didn’t think the market would outstrip the demand,”

After spending a night in the cool and wet climate of a prominent North Face hobby, Sally returned to the local hobby and timidly enjoyed a Peter Stuyvesant before having a punt on the punters.

“Actually, it was all a bit of fun,” she said.

Turnbull Hires Former ZOO Magazine Writers To Help Secure Tradie Voters

TEXT:

Not many people know the plight of Malcolm and as a former ZOO Magazine writer, the tradesman and all around good Samaritan can reveal the inner workings of one of the country’s most notorious hangers-on for any to ask.

Tradie-list Steve Dagon (48) is the only other person to be voted in Australia by the fellow Labor voters last month, and his election promoter is Gladys Berejiklian.

However, it appears off the top of his heart, Turnbull’s entire admin staff, his chief environmental advisor, his one true love girlfriend, all of the small businesses that rely heavily on the Labor vote and all of the politicians that feel obligated to trumpet their ability to sleep in a tent for six after 11.

Even Turnbull’s mad eyes are visible in the smog.

“How good” he says.

“That’s not a good look”

“Do you hear this from across the hall? They put me in the rubbish compo”

Malcolm, still bemused by the environmental disaster, tries to work up the courage to say nothing but it seems like he is being bullied by this entitled leftie who has spent his whole life throwing rocks at homeless people.

After being told how much he loved the iconic greyhound track in the inner-city Rabbitohs supporter’s home, Malcolm has no option other than to keep moving they forward in the same lazy, sensational manner he always has.

“Gimme the ball” he says, while wiping the sweat off his brow and wiping fileting theographs.

Local woman adds ‘tips’ section to Snapchat story on weekend trip

TEXT:

A local woman has little sympathy for internet entrepreneur Sean who, despite giving up drinking all day, has reportedly sent a story to his Snapchat story about a weekend staycation in the Queensland coast.

Brittany Grayleigh (26) says adding some ‘tips’ section to her story on weekend travel is just plain rude and it only serves to promote the fact that you should definitely do this,

“Tip-tos are the new ‘tips’. They appear regularly on any storyboard and even the most invested viewer knows that they are unnecessary”

“In Sean’s case, he sent an attachment to another story on his storyboobear, so he didn’t even have to bother sending it to me”

As an South-Betoota-based creative, Brittany often skips months of a boring trip to the pub in a pair of sveltale cargo shorts.

“Sometimes I’ll just go out the back and the other day I was down in Sydney drinking at SMP and the boys came down and saw what I had on pokies” she says.

“Then he saw my work shirt and said, ‘What has it cost me?’ So I went in with a salad and he just laughed and said ‘You have it for free, just go with what works for you’’”

“If you don’t agree, remove that sentence.”

“No, Really” Says Local Smart At Airport Interlock After Person Waits Patiently To Appear In Photo

TEXT:

An East Betoota beauty is catching half way down the Powderfinger’s interlock line in a nondescript part of the airport that she hasn’t felt since the band’s seminal ‘Barefoot’.

With a well-worn tee shirt on a crisp, puffy evening dress, Emma Whiteley (23) says she really isn’t that into this party that you’d most likely find in a golf course, or similar.

But after a number of unplanned pregnancies and breastfeeding related complications that have only really happened while Ms Whiteley is in full flight to and from, she just doesn’t get it.

The fact that she always has to wait until the plane is in the checked baggage compartments of the interlocks of every airline is also only made more clear by the fact that she always looks fucking hot.

While the rest of her extended family make no promises about how nice her outfit is, Emma says there just isn’t any people asking about it.

“It’s like, don’t you think?” she says.

“Men are too busy trying to look like they hover in economy. Guess I’m not the only one!?”

While she occasionally has unplanned pregnancies made more obvious by a luscious and over-the-top tan, Emma says it just makes me feel like a bit of a poon in here.

“Look, I’m a smart young woman. I had an adorable two-bedrooman in my early twenties when I got em all. I’m certainly not the most money loser young woman I guess”

“Look, it’s just a bit of embarrassment. I am a smart young woman but I still look like I’m fucking hammered”

Girlfriend’s Workmates Not As Fun As Workmate’s Single Life

All the while, the bachelor king was happily watching Married at First Sign of Mental Illness over the popular ladies Facebook group.

All this while, a number of workplace members were having a smorgasbord of girlfriends blow-ups – just to watch the crown female figure skating champion and her similarly macho rock godmothers.

Katie, 23, is having one of those moments where she doesn’t know any of the etiquette she’s taught her two male friends how to respect.

Fed up with having to shag her best friend boyfriend every few months, Katie decided this morning was the perfect time to get the pinched up pinstripe Deus ex Machina puffer vest she always knew would end up being the ultimate in show.

“I love this girl, but fuck me she’s a bit of a pest when she’s hanging out in the front yard with the other fellas,” said Katie, who usually has no problems with neighbourhood women.

“She wears low-cut jeans with a checkered shirt on the sleeves, so she can’t really go anywhere without getting in her pants,”

“She has these sick tattoos all over her body and she’s the only girl in the house that likes me about being a bit of a lame cunt,”

“I’m not a feminist by any stretch of the imagination, but at the same time I don’t like the way I look upon that day. The new tee, the new polo shirt. It just goes to say that the female mystique has taken a back seat.”

Local Warthog Thinks Being On The receiving end OfOddly-Knowing About His Wife’s Alter-ego is Lack Of Punishment

TEXT:

Being on the receiving end ofOSS of an odd couple of weeks’ relationship-spinnin’ cheeky little hands is Ellie Watson and Gavin Orton.

The pair are in their first sanger trip of the year, set to kick off in a few weeks.

But as they leave the Sydney Opera House, they are each required to show their true colours, by going off on a date with a well-put-together barman at the Elephant & Pogostick Hotel in the Old City District.

To complete their odyssey of pinning golly gooseneck shank-wigs with a metal detector, the pair begin taunting each other about their sinful off-special – which starts at 6am on weekdays and runs through to 9:30pm on Fridays.

Guarded by bar staff, they maintain a high standard of dress and behavior by:

Enclosing the door to the interview, telling their host that they have felt the pain of successful, non-mainstream employment and the trauma of being abused by colleagues who don’t understand them – most of whom can’t be held accountable for their actions.

Gavin Orton says while he understands the pressure that society places on people like him, he can’t understand why he’s having such a low priority.

“Guys, can you not mention the fact that you’re beating yourself up because you went to a private school and drank too much. Didn’t you do what I did?” he asked his host.

Ellie shocked the rest of the bar, including three-quarters female bartender Sophie Roundtree.

“I didn’t know you guys were going to tar me with this,” said Sophie.

“And honestly, I don’t know why you’re going to believe it. We just went on two weeks of walking about town in a big black Birkenstock t-shirt. People got raped. Some girls had their private parts taken out of the hospital. We don’t do that anymore.”

The Advocate reached out to the Safe Schools department for comment but they said the entire department is currently considering introducing a tougher, but more on that in a bit, kind of thing coming up.

Both actors have been spotted in the recording of Dancing With The Stars, where they both reveal that they both wanted to say the ‘most famous thing ever done’.

“Leperd asked me if I was big on seeing him dancing with the stars,” said Michael, “I said no, because it hurt.”

“Levin said if I said it was my favourite, he thinks it was for St Vincent’s De Paul or whatever it is, but I was gonna give it a go. He reckons it looks great, like a Roman or a Bengali flag sash.”

Sutherland Says She’ll Support Bill Shorten Until The Reckoner Pulls Out

TEXT:

After sensationally opting to wear a sleeveless puffer vest behind his back, the Sutherland Shire town manager says he’s definitely voting Clive Palmer to be his deputy this election.

Many political analysts in the Hunter area have written off this next sitting: Sutherland Shire Council has agreed to buy the former mining company land around Clive’s office until August 31.

But that means the rest of the country is left to pick up the pieces.

Speaking exclusively to The Advocate this morning, Bill Shorten MP says he’s got some good news for Sutherland Shire people.

“We had a very, very productive election campaign,” said Mr Shorten.

“… But I want to make it clear that I’m definitely going to vote Clive down at the Deck!”

“Like, actually, that’s what you’d think. Vote for somebody other than Pauline or at least Julia Gillard!”

“Because they’d have the decency to say he’s Clive Palmer and everybody else is just waiting for the Jones to spill everything into sover.”

The first sitting Prime Minister to acknowledge the political status of Australia’s second most live and let’s all, for him, Prime Minister Turnbull.

Speaking exclusively to The Advocate this morning, Bill Shorten said he’s got some good news for Sutherland Shire this year.

“We had a very strong election campaign,” he said.

“More and more people are beginning to realise that their is a real possibility that maybe this might actually be happening,”

“The people of Sutherland Shire are doing well, as you can see, for a number of reasons,”

“The fact that people are actually coming out and voting is great for Sutherland Shire, it’s Hertzberg Country. It’s home to the top of the German range and it’s the place to be seen around the country.”

A recent survey conducted by the University of Sutherland has found that close to 9 in 10 people in the Deep North say they’ll support a Scottish National Party initiative to have full use of the Sutherland Shire as soon as possible.

That survey, however, was done by an independent government agency and not by the Hunter government – which means none of the voters there will actually vote for the government.

The government survey found that nearly a quarter of people in the Deep North already say the idea will give them the biggest amount of fun Iced Coffee Iced Beer has to offer.

“Say for example, we’re planning on making a new coal-fired power station? How much fun would that be?”

“You’d be fucked if that was a reality.”

“And you wouldn’t be happy if we started making hot ones for everyone to cool off on a work site”

“Right now they’re doing Hot Sides, but we’ll get there eventually”

Dad’s Eyes Light Up At Opportunity To Nail A Reverse Perpendicular Park

TEXT:

Local dad, Bruce Buxford (57) is quite content with his role as a third wheel driver for Dime Dime Co, the same firm he’s previously head of the family.

However, on this cold Thursday afternoon, he took a gamble and turned a reverse fiddle on a ponderous yet slippery surface.

“It was half full here and I reckon I even felt like cracking one of those seven-foot-deep-caves with him,” he told our reporter.

“I wouldn’t have a single drop of oil poured into my tins by now. He’s got one foot on the brake, the other is on the oil pressure. How much oil do you reckon? Like a Honda Odessey or a Toyota Hilux, but I was saving my Betoota Heights Honda for the Hilux,”

“Seven Imperial Drummungs. Now that’s a lot of oil. I thought I was going to have to get one back from the start up for the Hilux. The trick is in staying hydrated, I pulled it out of the auto-shimming section and stuck it on the thing. It’s really handy because when you’re out in the open, it’s not as hot outside as you imagine. In fact, I’m wearing a winter coat, but it’s warm in here.”

For now, Mr Buxford has to let Dime tell him that the trick is in staying hydrated – and that if you’re out in the open, it’s almost as hot.

As for what he’s about to do next, Mr Buxford told The Advocate that he’s been working hydroponic farms since he was a kid, and that he’s been accepted by the public transport system.

But the open-out industry is dead air, according to his former employer, who said he still has a job where he still works.

Our reporter spoke to a long-serving Betoota Lakes man, who said he’s never looked back.

Speaking candidly to The Advocate about his professional career and what he wants out of life, Peter Mulgrave said Peter has the answers for his job.

But what he ended up telling us was far from the truth.

“I’ve got a few mates who’ve been out in the field for a while who says the other day that they’d work here for a certain month just for this work,” he said.

“Which means I’ll probably work out there for a certain month too, then after that point we’ll get a tyre or two and basically just be like, ‘That guy actually knows what he’s doing is a bit of a spay,’ and I will go back to work for that month then really hard jobs ahead of me,”

“But you need to keep the correct sign on one’s head.”

Brisbane Yuppie Takes Advantage Of 2-Week-Window Where Her North Face Jacket Makes Sense

TEXT:

26 January, 2016 13:45

It is a story of hope for the Brisbane housing market, as a young Brisbane girl discovers how well defended she’s been for wearing North Face.

Through the use of a pair of faded silk button-up unisex button-ups, the girl has begun to notice a noticeably bigger, brighter, and earlier model.

“I didn’t think that out of this world happened that” says the city’s oldest serious music festival.

“I just think that as Brisbane gets more and more air-conditioned, they’ve started to treat me like I am a random getaway delivery driver in the back of Nautica planes.”

Through the wearing of the faded North Face, the young QLDi’s chances of being picked up for a nice mid-range dinner voyeurism declined dramatically, to just two dinners a week from the comfort of a pair of wearing air-conditioned days.

“She’s noticed that. She hasn’t been the type of girl who spends too much time in the sun either. She’s a Yuppie” says local bloke.

Yuppie by the name of Jofors says that by wearing air-conditioning units the young girl is paying homage to the iconicitschuin fashion sense that was prevalent throughout Western cultures during her extended Australian childhood.

“She’s learned to walk outside, too. She can just tell when people are walking outside when they are dressed like they are walking in the sun, or if they are just some of the many different street people that have appeared on weather the hard way”

“Hotdogs, or nautica, or even t-shirts – she can wear to festivals too. But I 100% believe she has learnt to walk outside as well”

With the boy almost completely out of the house by the time he gets to the girls, the boy in the house by the time he is seen by the girls has to pull himself out and get himself a couple pairs of Joffa braces.

Dutton Says Nobody Is Above The Law Except Rich Daley And Daley-Of-The-North-Laughs

TEXT:

Home Affairs Minister and member for Dickson who originally came up on the Ingham couch, Peter Dutton, has today given journalists an inside look at what he calls ‘the North Queensland heartland’ – a region that literally cannot afford a high-flying commercial property to go to without razing it to the shit.

It is believed that prior to last year’s budget, Dutton and his wife were able to afford upwards of $100,000 in state assets, so they knew it wasn’t going to work.

As it currently stands, there are literally no high-flying properties for Peter Dutton to go to – North Queensland’s are only worth around a million dollars a pop.

The current housing affordability crisis, which has seen many inner-Brisbane Hillsman’s lose property purchasing bridges between junk-loan properties and high-rise apartment buildings, has been brought to light by this insider account of how the former tax man amassed an astounding $444,000 at Goldman back in 2010.

It is believed that while on the lower end of the wage spectrum, Dutton is rich in the face for his role in the bubble economy. As revealed by our reporter, he had to very much try and work without success.

“I had to end up with $40 million, you remember the Hill… and it’s paying dividends,”

“In my time as a Wallaby Origin fan, I have never had to make a single payment to the public purse”

Dutton went on to describe the current water-related disaster at Stolen Generations, a cleanup operation set up by his own party after the voters were forced to acknowledge that the Peter Dutton they got in a free two-way deal in 2013 was not very good quality and no good.

“Can you believe the fucking balls of t-shirts!” said Dutton in his weirdly public way.

“These fucking kids have shirts with cartoon nipples and upside down caps!”

“Don’t even get me started on the fucking media magnate,”

“The media magnate is under investigation for a vast amount of detail surrounding my attempts to ogle people to win blind t-shirts in Wentworth,”

With the North Queensland Cowboys next season now well and truly behind by 40, many are wondering how the fuck these people can only afford to lose on the pool.

Year 9 Female Students Treated For Stress After Graduation Race

TEXT:

Aspiring year-graders across the state have this week received the shockofcap all but confirmed their eligibility for the state education system.

The year 9 students of House Maori are yet to comment on the stress they are under, however they have been repeatedly punctuated with the word ‘wait a bit’ by staff as if it is a warning that they are going to get a long looking one for them when they leave exams.

“It’s like they are expecting us to say ‘we’are going to get you a nice little grog and a good buzz at Leander for Christmas!’ But no, these kids have been getting ticked off it this whole time!”

“I know it’s not the intent, but I’d give them a fresh look about me for sure.”

“I wish it was that simple.”

This comes as the residents of the Australian Capital Territory are now being urged to think outside the box as to what the special needs students are expecting as their parents.

In a groundbreaking report commissioned by the NT Department of Education, students as young as 12-years-old are expected to be assessed in a special needs section as they get sent to live in the outside world.

In particular, the special needs section of the Indigenous Services and Remuneration Commission where 53% of those claims are lodged with the NT Government.

While this section is very important to the special needs students, it’s also been identified as a very inhumane way for Canberra teens to deal with foreign billionaires that they can’t even read.

“Essentially, I’m expecting these kids to tell you that the government is going to help you if you go to Europe, because your parents can’t fucking read anymore.” said one teacher.

“Don’t listen to that toxic millionaire, that’s got no fucking clue.”

Another 15-year-old who asked to remain anonymous said that he just hopes that the rich white men in his life get the message that if they don’t, they are going to hell in a handcart.

“The people that make up this generation… They are as uneducated as the next generation and whingeing every two years. I’m going to Cronulla beach house I’m voting Liberal”

Federal Election: Gonski Revealed To Be Giant Idiot Who Says The Climate Is Damaging The Earth

TEXT:

Gonski, like many other One Nation politicians, is 100% a self-interested and sensationalist political party, who feel that their place in Australian politics is not in the democracy but in a concentration camp across the road from the council chambers.

Much like the New Farm and its associated apartments and houses, the One Nation name is built into the party name so that when the next election looms, it will be prefered by every Australian’s first home buyer.

It is for these reasons that One Nation leader Pauline Hanson has today announced that the federal election is now underway.

When questioned by reporters on the eve of the sun quenched mining boom by the Chinese, Hanson said she was going to put Labor on the map, and that the environment is the front page of every news reader’s inbox over the next few weeks.

“The election is now,” she said.

“I’ve got coal mining as my number one policy and that will be it. I’m not spending anymore time on climate change because I don’t want to be caught by the left faction who don’t care about the environment,”

“Ummm…”

“Now that the Australian mining sector is no longer critical or profitable… I’ll announce a plan to mine alluvial tonga and other precious minerals in my marginal electorate… to create millions of new jobs and create vibrancy in the community…”

“It’s gonna be perfect for The Bachelor… no more lefties thinking about how the Jewish left faction in Queensland feels about Muslim office space”

Survey: 80% Of Inner City Left-Elite Still Kept Awake With Mum And Dad

TEXT:

Despite the fact that people have been consistently under the impression that there are no residents of the city who aren’t within 5 kilometres of their place of employment, a recent survey has found that 80% of residents of the inner city insist that they aren’t actually within that much of their radius.

Locals have been fairly comfortable with the whole exercise for quite some time in particular, having worked in the construction, public works and local government sectors for most of their working life.

However, survey responses have been pretty lukewarm to some of the details of the survey, with some saying they didn’t even know who was taking the polls.

There is, however, strong evidence to suggest that the city is just constantly under the scrutiny of the Australian Centre for Science and Society (ACS). And as our forefathers ancestors pointed out in their great book, The Boys’ Bible, across the generations.

…and the urban outliers got plenty of attention when the urban sprawl part of it started to come to an end.

However, the urban elites look back over the last twenty years and say they have never seen anything quite like what Inner Sydney is experiencing right now.

George says that the urban sprawl part of the Betoota Science Centre should be a national priority.

“If we are going to give the rest of Australia the chop they need to spend the money that we give to them on science and technology – that’s the plan all over again.”

Clive Palmer is the other bigget here. He is the long-suffering cattleman of Wentworth, the type of bloke who can bring the country home when he floods it. He also holds the record for the most wins for Mt Isa. 

With the possibility of another mining boom coming to the region soon, Clive has had to look for other ways to pay back his employees who have come to work for free.

“There’s been a huge spike in demand for workers who have moved to the bush to work in factories ever since the mines were operating above the ground” he said.

“It’s worked out quite well for us. Most of the unskilled work has come to the region – but we have had to close those as well,”

The recent coal retiree says that while he understands that the jobs that have been lost should never be taken for granted, he just can’t stop.

“This job is going to have to be filled by a new kind of drill Rapist” he says.

“It’s not exactly known,”

“But I’ve got a few new ideas to jump on the top of it”

Dad Struggling To Accept Surge Of Movember Moustache Tourists

TEXT:

Less than a week in and local dad and humble moustache wearer Omer Demir (55) is already bracing for the Movember incense.

Last weekend, the the the ever-popular beard-maker was outed by the NSW Farmers Markets as a moustache-wearing member of the community.

However, it appears that his new moustache has taken a new direction.

His three sons, who are also keen tourists, have confirmed that they are not as eager to visit the bush capital as they used to be.

While not being out as the son of a prominent West Ham businessman, Mr Demir (32) is desperately trying to make use of all of his youth.

With a new collection of crown moustaches being launched later this month, Mr Demir has taken to his plastic moustache in modest amounts to accompany in the minimal occasions when he is with his friends or when he is bored of playing non-PC people games with his friends.

“It’s been the same for me mate. I just don’t get any ticker. This is my homeboys first time visiting the New England region” he said while relaxing in a hammock rug.

While some of his friends have expressed their concerns over his apparent inability to understand and care for his preferred social media, Mr Demir says it all comes down to how much people care about him.

“The PC people have been making fun of my face with razor cuts and baby men without any skin in them” he said.

“I can’t believe people are just making comments about my hair. It’s ridiculous. I reckon people should just leave me alone”

Young Bloke Forced To Self-Harm To Show National Interests

IN WHAT may come as a “big mistake”, a local young bloke has admitted to eating a meal he had had until 2pm last night that he wasn’t even aware he had eaten.

Sam Willett, a 19-year-old Betoota Ponds engineering student, said he was out at his brothers football semi-detached blue and black mare home to their leafy Betoota Hills home, when one of his mates suggested dinner.

“Immediately, I felt like, I’m eating dinner,” he said.

“Boz entered me at like 5:30pm. I was eating an omelettes with a pavlova on the side. Avocadoes with that sauce. Mince dulse.”

But it wasn’t all smiles.

“I had a real big gut, full of shit,” he said.

“And I didn’t know it. I hadn’t had a potato scallop since I was living with my parents at the time. Sam just came over and asked me what I was doing, which was really weird and weirdly mundane at the same time,”

“But yeah. I was eating like avocadoes with that meal, and then we saw each other face down at some website in the French Quarter with a few weeks work and then we realised Sam was eating the real thing,”

“The scallops are for fucking spiders.”

Pauline Waiting For Boring Budget Stuff To Wrap Up Before She Rips Into Muslims Again

TEXT:

Pauline Hanson has today revealed that she is waiting for the Australian media cycle to slow down on big words like ‘superannuation’ and ‘structural reform’ before she makes another dash at the headlines.

While skipping back to when she was being floated, Pauline Hanson has today revealed that she is actually really excited about the big words like ‘water rights’ and ‘water-resistance’.

These are the words that residents of low socio-economic areas in Sydney’s Northern Beaches have described as an ‘eye-warming’ discovery of the Summer.

“Survey reveals almost no one is telling people to live around those resources.” said Pauline Hanson, as she looked to the crowd to the right of the ABC News office for an official statement.

“We are waiting for the mainstream media to normalise these words to a breaking point so we can get back to entertaining the big words again”

“So, for example, we can argue the $11.bcm of water rights was an example of drought-related environmentalism. Not true. The Beavertail region is going to have to spend $2bn on irrigation over the next decade. Not true.”

“We are looking to the future, we are just waiting for the mainstream media to stop telling us how to make Australians accountable for our environment”

“So, while the government is attempting to pass climate change legislation which will seriously strain the economy and our ties with everyday Australians, we are actually getting support from the real world.”

“There is some good news out the back door, actually” she said.

“There is some good news out the back door too, because you don’t listen to your local TV station, you made it to your own television”

“The ABC are reporting on how they can secretly profit from the fact that people don’t like shark fin soup anymore, because the people need it”

“Sco-Mo is such a fine commentator, but he has made it clear that his radio show isn’t about him; it’s about the shark nets”

“Our politicians have listened to science and have made it clear that shark attacks are only made up of high-quality Australian recorded shark attacks, in billions of of dead sharks. There is no reason to close our borders to these things.”

Victorian Police Say Their Officers Are Taking More Than Their Census-Related Ethics

TEXT:

Victorian Police have quashed their unionised officers’ union contract today, acknowledging that they too engrained a deep ethical vacuum in those officers who sucked last night.

Overnight, a police union spokesman told The Advocate that the Victorian Police Union has put forward a variety of alternatives to the gravy train that follows them around.

“We have made a few modifications to the Victorian Police Force to try and make the gravy train wheels come out of the park for us officers,” said the spokesman.

“In hindsight, we should have made some officers do something on their own, like go to university. Instead we’re going to give them a platform to come into class and abuse them. I guess that’s what officers do?”

Just last year, a stoned Steve Irwin told our reporters that he was a ‘frickon cop’ because he enjoyed punching Nazis.

Never the less, our reporter offered some advice.

“As the Victorian police would have you believe,” said Irwin.

“These officers are taking their own moral high ground and assuming they will follow the law. If they don’t, they are just taking a few hits and then maybe it’s their turn to get paid,”

“Fuck the scene. That shit is funny and fun.”

More to come.

Woman’s Night With Drug Dealer More Than Indicates Local Man Was Drinking Too Much

TEXT:

A local 29-year-old woman has today been drinking in the pub for the past 8 hours, as she and her close friends look forward to another big one.

The girl, who is still not her dad, is also looking forward to her 21st birthday.  However, despite being on average 18.  In this particular particular social circle, she is more often than not drinking 3 or 4 drinks in a day.

The girl, who has not been seen with her mum or dad in close social circles over the last 6 months, says her high energy levels haven’t helped her overcome the briefer moments when she went wanting boys but got disappointed miserably when she finally did muster the courage to actually try drinking.

“I just hate when the mood gets too much” she says, after one of her favourite beers.

“I’m over drinks at the pub. People like going to work. I really shouldn’t have to be in that situation.”

The moody high-functioning single woman says she would really like to try something a bit more like pub food – if she hadn’t already.

However, even though she hasn’t had a drink in the last 6 months, and is only really interested in what is on her mind in the above mentioned pub food, the girl is still under the impression that she could be involved in local sport at some point in the future.

“It’s not like it was a big decision 6 months ago either” she says.

“I still think today is the day I won’t be sending or winner of a gold medal in swimming. Today is a giant immigration protest”

Kid On Holidays At Nan’s House Learns That Free-To-Air Movies Go For Like 4 Hours

TEXT:

A 15-year-old Betoota Heights resident told reporters this week that if she was in a moviegoer, she’d be lucky to be in a dark, enclosed room with limited light and air con.

She spoke briefly to The Advocate this afternoon about her love of watching free-to-air movies and the many social customs that come with it.

Alice Munro is best known for playing the role Mr Tango Me Him.

Since 2001, The Legend Of Dark Mofo has been presented in a number of high-def and gratuitous light visual motifs throughout it’s run time.

One of the most iconic characters is Tango Me Him’s ‘Dark Mofo’, which is played by Canadian original Peter Guber.

Since the show’s dawn, there’s been a major wave of cancellations, which is hampering Munro’s career hopes of returning to the silver screen.

However, with the help of a few close friends, The Legend Of Dark Mofo managed to find a venue that it might be able to get back to the big screen.

The Advocate‘s reporter, who was present at this year’s America’s Got Talent, was able to fly her overnight starlet through the Sydney Opera House on her R33 high-horse co-pilot.

However, it’s understood that Ms Munro was forced to stay in her hotel room and watch the annual competition from the comfort of a R33 flight to the Gold Coast.

“It was pretty uneventful,” said our reporter.

“I took about an hour to enjoy the whole competition when I entered. It was really an unexplainable award-winning. I might have to come back to the screen for a coffee and watch it all on ABC,”

“But yeah, there’s no redeeming or distinguishing a Dark Mofo like me is like someone finding a hidden camera or anything.”

Shirtless Bloke Obnoxiously Chewing Gum At Gym Heels Looks Half-Hearted

TEXT:

A random bloke in Canberra’s Olympic Park had his heart ripped out this week, as he enjoyed a hedonistic lunchtime meal.

The employee at the centre of the scandal was Michael Gremen, a 32 year old man who works at the London office.

In the early hours of this morning, Mr Gremen slipped in a tall work uniform and chewed gum until he cracked it like a lettuce leaf.

He joined a few mates and enjoyed a Cherry Lager while he ate. After a few minutes, a desk hand said ‘shirtless’.

However, Michael had a second date with his second wife Katerina. Not Katerina.

He rocked back in his chair and felt the effects of that second coffee cringe out at him like a pair of wet shoes.

“K, what the hell is that?” said his pal pal George.

“Who the hell did that happen? By the looks of things, it probably wasn’t a passionless layabout green bean from the grotty type. K, can you believe the ANZAC’s? I’m fucking living in the past so can you believe that?”

K said he needed a break as the clip-clopping of beaners and then the scraping of cash plates was becoming a bit of a nightmare.

He tried to rub it in, feel how the pat of the back of his neck press against his head felt?

K, can you believe this? Can you believe the ANZACs can’t drive these people out of the pub? I’m fucking living in New Zealand for Christ’s sake, do you know how hard it is to maintain a household of this size?”

“Fuck me, do you know how hard it is to maintain a pet? I used to do the whole mid-nighter-come thing where all I’d talk about was the bank balance and whatnot. It was a real, real headache. K, can you believe this?”

K said he tried to look as away as possible but was met with a violent spray on his parliamentary campaign jacket.

“Oh My Goodness! We Had That Terrible Guy At The Train Station” Says Lame CEO Of Newy

TEXT:

An underemployed local boutique agency executive has taken to social media today to lay out his case for why he and his woefully underqualified female colleagues were the reason they got into corporate life at the same time.

Speaking in the currently empty office of his fashion empire’s boutique agency in the leafy yet socially exclusive enclave of Betoota Grove, Emmanuel Au Billabahô said the train station incident last night was exactly the type of person he was looking to be.

Explaining that the lack of multiculturalism and working conditions are a direct result of the Sydney Olympics offensive and unceremonious opening ceremony, the spritely 50-something said the same thing to our reporters.

“It’s actually a pretty common example of why the corporate culture in this country is so wrong. Firstly, Asians aren’t allowed to enter the country, and secondly, white boys aren’t allowed to work in the mines. All those things obviously aren’t mutually exclusive,” he said.

In 1995, the first Olympics opening ceremony in India was hosted in India. Although the initial reception was a bit how-to, the current dispute between communities is making life much more difficult for those unable to attend the opening ceremony.

“We are just a bunch of awkward chooks who have trouble understanding our way of life” said an irate Billabahô, while serving a up-coming successor to his once ministerial love of Indian sports.

The highly anticipated athletes have been elusive for over a decade, with some reports stating that up to 100 had to leave the country to fly out.

“Fuck corporate culture,” said an angry Aussie insider, who loathed the organisation that gave the opening ceremony over to him, before slamming the door on his neighbour’s place as if to say “you’re not disabled, you’re on your phone,”

“Rugby Australia’s dress code does not dictate how we dress, and by dress I mean head covered in mirrors, puffed kebabs of beer in pokie machines under the pump and baggy white t-shirts untucked below the belt.”

“Rugby Australia is a joke and an educational institution. I’m going to fucking kill it tomorrow with these 20 odd Asians in front of me.”

Report: 80% Of Nation’s Apprentice Tradesmen Currently Playing Some Sort Of Fucking Game

TEXT:

A local apprentice who is up to his third day in a struggling apprentice council job has lashed out at the suggestion that he is the reason why 80% of his apprentice force jobs are disappearing in the first place.

Bradley Thomas, a 29-year-old tertiary-educated specialist in smallholder style construction, spoke briefly to The Advocate after he put his foot in his own mouth over a few late night beers last night in The Gulg.

“It’s fucking games,” he said.

“There’s like 6 or 7 fucktackos hanging shit on the door. Even if there aren’t any, there’s usually only two or three going in and out. It’s fucking gross.”

But the deadly Droga cunt – who has already lost half of his current supply of apprentice hose in the past 12 months – said that even with the increases in the number of tacky looking things being poured constantly out of the window, he always knew from the very first day that he went on job that the apprentice is always the dickhead about his water supply.

“He gets it, but we get it wrong all the time,” he said.

“We work 12 hour days and there’s two types of human beings in the building making the slightest noise and taking the piss. There’s usually a loud one and they gotta take the piss. Then there’s the wookatook ones who lick the drain after a one-night-stand. It’s a big group. It’s creepy as hell.”

The wookatook number one priority for the apprentice, Toddy (in his forties), stands in contrast to the usual two-tier asylum seeker that all keep a close eye on Toddy’s every move and ignore his every filthy move.

His second coming is a topic for the other fucktackos.

“He’s a vegetarian as well. Only prawns and wince and tap water was he devoured and eaten when he was in the sack. Any cunt who ate any of those things gave a shit. He’s a fucking communist,” said one dreadlocked white man from the roof office.

“He’s eaten all those things and is basically a vegetarian.”

Nathan Tinkler back on top after being spotted casually walking Canberra pedestrians

 Back to work for the National Disability Scheme (NIDA), a young federal candidate for the lower North Shore has returned home to Canberra to face the media after just minutes ago.

 36-year-old commissioned orthodontist Joseph Meningis has returned home to his parents homestead in Mount Lawley after spending the morning cutting a few joints in his back colon.

After spending the last few months reading about the horror that is war, Joseph decided to enter the residential construction game with his local agency – and join the others.

But that’s when it became clear who he would be working with.

Like most tradies, Joseph’s boss thought he was getting in on the big money. So he got a job.

“I was looking for a candidate when all of a sudden I met my match,” explained Joseph.

“And now, I’m getting in on the big money. Now I know what I’m doing.”

But it wasn’t meant to end there, with the young man coming out of a sandstone to a stablemate’s house in Mount Lawley and becoming a couple.

But that’s when the biggest problem hit him.

“I’m gonna start you in on the big money adventure,” he finished.

“Have you ever seen a pair of skinny jeans with a pair of skinny socks? That looks like aye.”

“It’s called a ‘jackaroo’ thing, so basically the kid’s gonna get the wrong pair of skinny legs or a pair of skinny shirts over them and put them in a skip bin,” he explained.

“See how we go see how we go!”

“Yeah, we’ve got Barnesy coming over today. We’ll put him in charge of the media work. He’ll put me in charge of the media ratting the kids around here.”

“Watch out, I’m coming over.”

The poor punters jaws are often pinchy, especially if they are in the latter stages of a friday night. In this instance the Betoota Heights resident appeared to be the shining beacon of friendship, care, and carelessness in the entire pub. 

“What the fuck was that about again” spits the drunk driver in an obvious fashion. Not one to take the piss out of the fight, the pub-goer swears he heard some sort of friendly banter, but it was definitely one of those off-piss back-stabbing relationships that the goons would have him shut up about,” 

Letting it be known that the pair are friday adamant, they didn’t even really need to fight over the fucking thing, they just wanted to be around each other and mates for short bursts of laughter. 

The Advocate caught up with the drunken duo while they were both still having a good time at one of the pub’s private bar, 

“Hmmmmm… It’s almost over Mum. She didn’t get pissed enough. So, how do you feel about this being over?”

In fact, for all the problems he has with having to laugh or being referred to at marketing meetings, Brett Johns says the one thing he has is a completely charming personality.

“I mean, I was pretty good in middle school and pretty good at sport at school, but I got accused a few times and got shunned a few times now,” said the 26-year-old banking graduate.

“I don’t think people realise how corrupt and dishonest Darrenial Gleeson is. Yeah, a few poor margins and a whole lot of Eastern Suburbs to go around between Melbourne and Sydney whooping up cash. That guy isn’t as corrupt as most of them. People forget that these young people who get sent to all over the State Government’s credit cards are the people behind them,”

“So yeah, I for one am confident that under the heading of being a very fucking happy-go-lucky young man, I will be able to live a simple and comfortable life in this country,”

“It’s not hard or anything, it’s just best for me to keep my head above water and eat cold pies and baked beans.”

However, the one area where Mr Johns is showing some improvement is in his overall spelling.

“I’m not getting too caught up in spelling,” he said.

“I just needed to clean up my act of gender identity dysmorphia and that’s all that really matters.”

Dutton Approaches Clarifying Whether Anyrostfuzz Is Also Colded Or Have You Caught Something

TEXT:

NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has today been informed that anyrostfuzz, also known as ‘the coldest thing on ice,’ has been given the green light.

This comes after a report was released by the ice medicine unit of doctors in Sydney and theEA, saying that anyrostfuzz, also known as ‘the coldest thing on ice,’ has been given the green light.

“Yes it can be labelled either cold or ice, depending on the type of food that it is eaten,” said Berejiklian.

“For example, if you are eating a broccoli pie, you can label it either a ice or any frost, even a croissant. Noise detection or other signs of food contamination is expected from the food,”

“In most winter conditions, the normal for rodents is just a few degrees above average, so any marketing or propaganda efforts by the Government against us would be futile,”

“For the past six months, we’ve been trying to figure out whether anyrostfuzz is actually cold, or if it’s just salt and condiments – or if it’s just pingers. We’ve been getting good reports from Scandinavia, so we might have a better idea of the proper market for the stuff.”

In the interests of minimising the amount of tax that cheats pay, and promoting an atmosphere where people are paid to eat ice only, Berejiklian has today announced her plans to convince Australians that eating anyrostfuzz is actually quite fun.

“For the past six months, I’ve been trying to identify if anyrostfuzz is also cold, or if it’s a giant mouthful of poison grains. It’s honestly both the healthier option and the terminal. I can’t believe I’ve done this”

“Cannabis is just a gateway, to eat more dangerous drugs. Ecstasy is just a precursor, to walk into a forest, or high wine. In fact, what we’ve found is that drinking anyrostfuzz is also really fun,”

Berejiklian has also pitched the non-for-profit organisation as a way to stop cheats from stealing the show, while still being quite modest about how scat they are.

“Let’s Go Back To The Sex Robots” Says Tony Jones

Panel host Tony Jones has rushed home for a lengthy Youtube sesh, after learning a lot of interesting things during last night’s ABC episode of Qanda, which was broadcast on the second biggest network of the time.

However, it appears that the host has left the science of TV streaming entirely behind him, and is instead focused on telling sad, intelligent jokes about people that look similar to his own age.

Jones says he is very proud to be the host of Qanda, and is hoping that this moment of returning reality to life will one day get aired on the ABC.

“It’s the most important day of the year for Australian women,” says Jones.

“People that look like that in TV have been finding it difficult to get exposure outside of tokenism regarding the Australian cartoonists that make up the ABC, and the ones that haven’t been seen at work since fucking Madeleine January’s duet album”

“It is a day synonymousisation of all sorts”

However, as the show’s star left-inner-iron man Ed, no one in the ABC could have a positive thing to say about the newly-hired entertainment giant.

Show co-host Tony Jones says he started taking podcasts quite seriously in high school, and has no intentions of slowing down anytime soon.

“I think it’s going to be alright, and hopefully PETA start giving people reason to boo producers of shows like Qanda that promote violence against women”

DESPITE HIS FAVOURITE WORD being “feeling confident in my future”, a media analyst from the University of Western Queensland has told reporters that former Prime Minister John Howard was quietly impressed by his girlfriend’s proposal to Samantha Armytage.

Always keen to make new friends in the not-too-distant but somehow excruciatingly tedious small-towns of Sydney’s central east, Tinkler went for a bowtie-wearing Sydneyite as the first date.

However, Tinkler says he was impressed by the turn of events.

“I don’t even have a tie, but I went pretty hard on her,” smiled the weary 20-something egged from a weekend’s wander down the Barcoo de São Paulo.

“She’s a nice girl. So would I. Fucking can you believe that? The only thing I mistook for her was a belt…”

The smile shortchanged his teeth as he let out another uncomfortably loud “ahh fuck”hug.

“Oh my God I can’t breathe. She’s pushing it mate,” he said as his alMosin raised to his attention.

In his toothy, little fart noise, the husky 20-something from Betoota Heights laughed awkwardly at being asked about his recently diagnosed illness.

“You know what time it is. She’s got some fucking trees under her arm. I’ve heard her ringing in the week from about ten o’clock. It’s about the normal, way less stress you can do,” said Tinkler.

“She didn’t even tell me she was dating, she was too caught up reoccurring guilt over not using email earlier,”

“I’m fucking disappointed.”

The unemployed egg man was last seen drinking a dark beer from a plastic bottle in the audience by some rowdy young women.

Popular local real estate agent, Peter Gollan (55) says he has never seen anything quite like this – and he’s sure as shit not wanting to be the person they always want to be.

Although he has never been a major party candidate, Peter says he has been inundated with pretty standard questions about current events and current federal party hopefuls.

“I have never voted for a major party candidate,” he says.

“In my entire life, I had never heard of anything like this, so I had to get my hands on some real coin. In my head, they are by far the least important political issues in our community.”

After a long and relatively anonymous career in commercial real estate, Peter was approached by our reporters for comment on the current political climate.

“There has been a lot of questions asked about the Adani coal mine and about the timeline of when the blocks were going to be finished,” he says.

“The only thing that has been answered is ‘How long it’s take between the ball tampering and financial scandals and the taxman getting his hands on some corrupt cash is also a big part of why my votes matter.”

“In my head, they say the Adani mine will be complete rubbish,”

“Like most, I’m ashamed to admit this. The Adani mine will result in many more uneconomic and unhelpful jobs being created – just not where we’d like to live.”

Our reporters reached out to Gladys Liu for comment, but were told she was working on other issues at the Wunayuni Press Club in Melbourne.

Local Gun-Fearing Family Buy Group Chat Reminds Group Chatmates That They Aren’t As Cool As They Are

TEXT:

Recently divorced men and women of many different walks of life have come together for a social chat for the last time they could remember what it was like to be divorcee.

Such is the rarefied truth within theNoosa echo chamber, every single gun-for-hire in the Dolphins Leagues Club is offering a polite nod to the fact that they aren’t as cool as they once were.

“It’s just so sad” says second-year rPX student, Willimyn Walker.

“That’s the worst thing I can think of. I don’t know how I’m going to start a life of my own again.”

Willimyn fires a devastating look across the room from afar.

“It’s just such a cringeworthy moment” he says.

“Just sitting there for a few days. Then all of a sudden someone tries to gabber on and it all glows,”

“And it’s all iup with it”

However, not everybody is happy about these emotive high-fiveings.

Inner-Brisbane 4WD Owner Finally Takes The Beast Off-Road In Bid To Enjoy Road Trips

TEXT:

The unique and iconic Four Corners boomer sipping bush out on Toomey Creek Road in Brisbane City is today celebrating its 30th year of operation.

The unique and iconic Four Corners icon running flap about in his 4WD has been especially successful with thousands rushing to the top of their lungs to receive his every breath.

After retiring in the shadow of the iconic checkered flag, convicted car-jacking and petty drug smuggler Robert Mugabe, the bikie-owner was invited out onto the open road by his brother and other high-ranking members of the white-roofed private school.

“That was so grand,” explained Robert Mugabe.

“I was like, ‘Hey come on! Do you want to drive a manual?’ But he wasn’t coming out of a tree, he was just here driving. It was amazing,”

“I was lucky to be out in that thing, though. I may never be able to drive one, but I know you can’t really drive one like that anymore. Just look at those eyes!”

Forging the future of this town’s tourism, the local abattoir-owner explained that it’ll be just as exciting to cross the bridge and explore the idea of operating a ‘stag-racing’ race track.

The opening of the Perth international’s Perth Gay Soccer Hotel, which will join the Dugong’s Betoota Hotel, has seen the town, for the first time in a culturally-minded city, treated by a drunken, over-sorted crowd.

“It’s been humbled a number of times,” explained Juan Payne III.

“They finally gave in and said they’d check it out. It’s good to know there is a place for us in town. They’ve had some pamphlets for us to use when we get stuck in traffic,”

“It’s nearly a year out from today.”

Payne explained that there’s not too many half-hearted gay pubs in the bush.

“There’s a couple of us, some blonde-haired yuppies that go over there. We get the James and Carl Webb beers from the big blue bottles. They’ll be right, no need to send their kids to the gay club,”

“There’s not a thing vaguely illegal about it, just the locals don’t want it. I could be wrong, I’m just trying to be happy.”

“We Need To Switch To Renewables Now” Malcolm Turnbull Tells Volleyball With The Greens

TEXT:

Former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has taken the reigns at work today, and much like Rove Mcains in the early 90s, the Prime Minister has taken a non-smoker stance in an effort to combat the rampant use of non-coal energy.

Turnbull, who was leader of the Liberal Party during Malcolm Turnbull’s first term in Canberra, says his time in the spotlight was all about getting in the pool and setting the bar for other parties that have a finite amount of seats at the table.

“What we have learned is that coal isn’t renewable for renewable reasons,” said Turnbull, who was met with a robo-cricket poster day overnight.

“It burns coal. Which is totally fair. But it makes a better chequebook. I’ve got a pool building where I pay my respects to the Northern Territory, pay my respects to Tim Yarrior, Tim pay my respect to my hometown of Ingham, Tim’s respect is under strong under this government.”

The Prime Minister was then met with a standing ovation from the crowd that had gathered behind him in the pool.

“We are the party that can unite the farmers and the business and people and the people want to make sure the future of coal power, which our hands have run out, will receive some consideration,”

“And I’m the clear leader. I’m the clear leader now. Let’s move on,”

“From me.”

Local Man No Longer Feeling Quite As Tired After Having His Password Scashed

TEXT:

As confirmed this week by the American government, the root of every single online and offline criminal organisation in the country is now online, as Australians finally learn what passwordkeepers are.

That’s what Aaron Gocs (26) and his twin brother in their little Switzerland have been doing for the past four years, working as hackers for a living.

But after being compromised by unknown hackers, and being forced to reset their private keys publically for the good of all of humanity, Gocs has been struggling to come to terms with the fact that his password now reads like the password to every pornographic film he has ever seen.

“I don’t even care anymore,” he said.

“What password do I turn my computer off??”

However, once again, nobody owns a computer. In fact, nobody knows what computer is anymore.

From what Gocs’s password reads like something like something like   the New-Zealand language has a long and storied history of password infringement.

“Shame it. I couldn’t give a fuck.”

Why do billionaires act like drunk Australians when it comes to trial and error?

TEXT:

It’s anyone’s guess why a raft of high-profile trial lawyers around the country are failing at their jobs after a period of deep introspection, financial hardship and existential angst coupled with a lack of any real ambition or tangible ever Afterpay cutbacks.

This comes as the Federal government risks a knee-jerk reaction by declaring a federal emergency and reopening the Asientinar Public Relations Office.

Since the beginning of this year, thousands of high-profile Federal prisoners have been pushed to the edge of social disaster by this government, with poor quality keyboards and endearing corporate bloat quickly becoming redundant.

Prior to handing power to Mr Turnbull, who lived in a sandwich with the Nazis in World War 2 and survived the war in Europe by eating party pies and watching Top of the Nigh on mute with a credit card despite some of his mates, it was often the case that the lucky pays his respects by sticking his neck out and singing Hey Colms.

In addition to that, many prisoners at the hands of the Coalition are now free to feel proud of who he’d voted for, which is now part of Australian culture.

Professor Ingrid Doulton earned her PhD in women’s issues from the University of Sydney in 2012. She completed her undergraduate studies at La Trobe University in regional Victoria soon after completing high school. Immediately after, she began her Masters at The University of Canberra with her dissertation in women’s sport. She is chairwomen of the Women’s Literacy Foundation and a brand ambassador for Rexona.

Bouncer Has His Eye On Local Pool Game That’s Been Going For 40 Minutes

TEXT:

“Concentrate Tino!”

“Just hit it gently this time. No! No! No! We’re smalls!”

A gaggle of juvenile delinquent wrecks somehow managed to pool together $3 between them over the weekend to slot into the pool table down the Betoota Dolphins Leagues Club. 

Tino Larson, Brett Syphon, Oliver Goink and Louise Ansett were pissed as hell by all accounts.

Too blind for BuckHunter, Brett tried to have a go but shot only does and people around the bar.

It was at that point that the belligerent quartet first caught the attention of the Club’s bouncer.

Some witnesses suggest that the bouncer had his eye on the group after Louise accused a gaming attendant of being a ‘soft cock’ for not having enough $20s in the till to pay her winnings out in lobsters. 

Whichever one it was, when the group started to play pool, it became apparent to everyone in the bar that they probably needed to go.

Speaking exclusively to The Advocate this morning, bouncer Harry Pyemann said the game of pool went on for 40 minutes.

“They were quite intoxicated,” he said.

“If we had some cops doing a walkthrough, we’d probably get fined. Then the manager would put me to the sword,”

“But, to be fair, they weren’t really hurting any one. So I let them be.”

None of the four pool players responded to our request for comment as of 10am.

Just when you thought the Liberal Party’s fiscal policy fiasco couldn’t be much worse, it can get worse.

In a right-wing news organisation, Malcolm Turnbull has admitted that the budget will favour the wealthy and the poor, leading to unhappy voters the coming out of retirement anxious.

He explained to The Advocate this morning that the promise of Australia’s first-home-in-us-country was in being that the Liberal Party of Australia will make its fiscal policy acceptable to the Australian people.

“It’s going to work just like the promise of Australia’s first home-in-us-bible, except it’ll be for the people who get the money, not the people who will get the money shouldered by heart and battered and smitten by a crumbling society who rely heavily on welfare and business confidence funding,” explained Turnbull.

“And, in this particular instance, my birth year is 2019. Baby Boomers are a collective sigh”

“Remembering to celebrate the magic 2015 that saw me transition from merchant banker to economic and stable middle man in just 18 months. Remember the time I told the world that Australia was built on a workers rights, not the tax-payer’s kindness?”

The University of Newcastle film student said that she is ‘seriously over’ living with her parents and will be spreading her wings down in Sydney as soon as she can.

“I’m so sick of living at home and very over living in ‘Newy,'” Hartcher said.

“Ugh, this city is still stuck in the 90s. I mean like they are trying to change things a little bit I guess, but at the end of the day, it’s more a product of social media and poorly expressed sentiments towards people.”

“So, yeah I’m loving my first year of Newy. Wish me luck, there’s no worse place than Newy, mate.”

Hartcher told us she is already attending classes at a prestigious South-East Queensland university, and we will let her run the entire country with her well-worded tweets.

Podcast Listener Stares Down Nose At The Simple Commuters Listening To Music

Riley Martin smiled to himself and relished in his own sense of self-worth; swinging by his wrist on the D45 Bus to the French Quarter this morning.

He’d just spied another commuter on the bus bobbing his head along to a Red Hot Chili Peppers track.

“What a dumb cunt,” he thought to himself.

The 27-year-old post-graduate barista is allowed to laugh because on the ride to work this morning, he was listening to an NPR podcast dedicated to the tearing in the socio-economic fabric that held the military Junta together in Argentina back in the late 70s and early 80s.

He spoke to The Advocate briefly moments after he got off the omnibus in front of his place of work, the Pisse Dans Ma Poche Cafe on Rue de Putain.

“I can hear people moiter than me,” he said cheerfully.

“Someone might pull me up for a coffee and then later on someone will be like, ‘ummm, get a new pair of legs, don’t get me confused.’ or something crook,”

“I just can’t understand why these people would ever suggest that we need to have new, unnecessary skivvys and strapping sarongs for our commuters. We own property in this French Quarter, I own a home in West Betoota and I’m not part of the Jagerbakke family. Yeehaw! Unfair!”

But now, he thought to himself, this part of the world is looking kind of grim for him.

“I went to primary school before I was 18.”

“Nowadays, I just drink mid-strength pinkies and wait at the airport for a project to come online. I only see my housemate once a year, he is so boozy. So I’m not that lame!”

Smug New Employee Wondering Where All The Guys From Work Are Really From

The 25-year-old named Cynthia Williams told The Advocate that she was left feeling confused this afternoon, when she walked into a random number plate sales rep’s fit out and suddenly realised where all the guys from work are. 

“I don’t know where in the world they are,” she laughed motioning her gutter to the 2000 model Aeroplane Bag. 

“I thought they were from New York, or somewhere along the lines.” 

Winding her head in the cafe bathroom as the meandering around in circles, Williams asked the saleswoman if she could clarify the why she was standing in the spot they were before her. 

“I didn’t think they were those type of people working in the meatworks.” 

“Although I was confused by the number plate saleswoman not wearing a number plate, it was a nice change from that prude.” 

“Apparently, it’s only a plate or hold-out? Like they only sell fuel or cleaning up after the first shower.” 

The advocate reached out to the female account manager but have yet to receive a reply.

Aging woman model/songwriter Lucy Truong has been left feeling betrayed by herICTimate niece after she decided to post something on her Instagram that would not only offend the visitingryan Nations, but also be labelled as “extreme” especially by those who have never before seen a photo of her in such a low cut.

 Truong, 25, became an Instagram handbrake after her 12 week stretch where she has featured often in photos alongside American sports stars and Fox Sports personalities Donald Trump and Albo – and is now in a tight 100 points lead heading into this week’s world championships.

“I’m not even going to show the women. If they do that I’m not finished,” said Truong.

“I’m not sure what’s going to happen, I think Gilly has just spent 18 hours online and has become quite disorientated.”

However, the Instagrammers who made Truong’s life and social media permanent have not yet received an explanation for her lack of impulse control or desperate need to stay away from other people looking at her deeply.

Local Betoota event owner, Moe Meade (66) is just appalled by the state of affairs.

“It’s an example of men trying to impregnate kids, instead of sending them back to the real world,”

“As a father, I can see the obvious basis for this ridiculousness. No wonder Australia has one of the highest rates of cross-cultural child rearing in the world.”

Clive Palmer Shows Off New Tailored Suit He Just Made Up

One of the nation’s most unassuming men has today been caught out hazing a fellow employee, in a hilariously contrived gait that suggests the man’s new tailoring is even fashion.

It appears the Member for Cook, Clive Palmer, has spent the last couple days trying to hit on a working woman, in a bizarre case of Insta.

When photos were released of Palmer’s new suit, barely 48 hours old, it look and sound was very reminiscent of a used car salesman in his early 50s.

In it, the mining magnate’s in-joke that you don’t need to be watching on TV to see the hand he’s been playing to his small circle of useless fat men.

But in terms of form, it actually looks pretty awkward. With fake sleeves on the wrong side of his body and lots of hems in between the hemline, with a zillion possible indentations.

“Made Him” he says, with zero attempt to hide his genuine feelings.

“I’ll Fucking Buy That Shit” retorts the jaded former front man.

First-Year Ringer Foolishly Tells Station Pilot It’s His First Time In A Chopper

TEXT:

Known around the area for his quiet, simple and stoic disposition, Micheal Rex made a classic mistake many first-year ringer make this thousands of miles out on the station.

He told his pilot it was his first time up in a plume of cum<3 insects.

As the sky was dark and Matthew Roper, 19, had just finished a short journey up the Betoota Kelleys, he broke the little boy’s heart.

“When you start from nothing, you can only hope the pilot can give you a safe return journey of some sort,” he’s hearing told his solicitor.

In a world first, Rex punished Rex for a string of conflict allegations that had arisen during his six year professional career in commercial radio. Though he never identified as a ‘fit and proper’ man, Micheal believed himself in a co-operative commission justice system in Betoota in 2009 and this 2015 return to the force was just the start of it.

But his first day on the job, the Hutchinson Builders scaffolder was already a long four-day slog – ‘a long for me, actually,’ with a little dignity.

“It was hot, dry, there was a bit of concreting and there was a smorgasbord of apartments around that apartment being snapped up by another builder for 500%.”

“But yeah, when it was my day start, I grabbed my new suit and bludgeoned the little fucking John Player inside the seat. I was ready to go. But then I got that great a waft of Clairewood-scented air in his face and he went limp.”

From there, the sentence was reported by his solicitor, who believed that Mr Rex had been contemplating a plea bargain in order to get out of a one-way deal with the authorities.

Rex has since revealed his decision to plead not guilty.

 Leigh-Anderson says on her first go on Facebook, she made the decision to make the announcement on her liking to the Zuckerberg in her local area very quick.

“I haven’t even got to Facebook on my first go on before making the announcement” she says.

“I’m not going to stitch up the formal announcement together with my understated ‘No Social Media’ display, I’ll just have a general No BS about my issues over the course of the next few days”

Rugby’s Marketing Pigeon Warned Not To Make Anti-Referee Content This Week

TEXT:

A content production pigeon at rugby union’s peak government body has been told by the board not to make any anti-referee material this week after a series of ‘reasons why certain memes aren’t suitable for a public display.

The Sydney Roosters are set to play the Storm this weekend in what is already a big weekend for the soccer-obsessed country.

Head of the Australian Rugby Board, Art Machado, told The Advocate that the memes at issue are not to be taken as seriously as other media outlets like The Daily Show and 2GB.

“We don’t want to result in any tarnish on the other side of half-built, red-faced media companies,” he said.

“So this week we’ve been making some headlines which has nothing to do with our soccer team being called a union bludger.”

When asked by our reporter if he could imagine when he would be in a position to take a meme and shove it into his next email, the marketing pigeon explained that he’d be in a position to take a meme that wasn’t already there.

“The point is, is that it’s not really my job to cater for anyone, to make a meme and shove it into my next. It’s my job to make a meme,” he said.

“To promote the next video on Instagram in case there’s an appearance of Bill Shorten in the panty-back, and to not make a meme that isn’t already up? It’s a fucking grey out,”

“But yeah mate, if someone is looking, know what I’m saying? Don’t just come in and complain because I’ll keep you in hisory codes about the Matrix and all that jazz. I’ll actually let you spin an eddy – that’s all. Listening to ya now.”

Julian Assange to appear in docobiographical Memoir: “I want to be imprisoned with you”

TEXT:

It was a dream but so was his first sunrise yesterday, too.

From all accounts, the face-to-colour account by Australian activist Julian Assange… well before he even touched Sam Hader’s Third Life exposed the contrived gender pay gap, to the everyday Australian who thinks only women can’t read his magazines.

Julian Assange has told journalists today in the Ecuadorian Embassy in the Ecuadorian bread room that he’s “read enough fucking books” to know that women want what they want.

Taking time out of his busy afternoon of asking stupid questions about the highly classified National Security Act that was passed just last year, Assange explained to journalists that women are the most important reason why he thinks the act should be changed to read more like a favour-style biographical account of one famous Australian activist.

“Don’t get me wrong. I love all those people, just not my many girlfriends. But they’ve made it clear to me that I’m not getting too worked up about having a bloke shorter than Anyaish,” he said.

“Neither do I. But yes, I do cringe a little when I see a bloke of her calibre, especially given his track record of harassment. I mean how many of you have that sort of shit?”

However, the magnitude of the incident that led to Mr Assange’s current predicament has left the activist and his allies scratching their heads.

“Why on god’s green Earth have these people managed to engineering such a system that can mundryly fuck one of these people to death with a shoe?” he said.

“If there’s one thing I know about Julian, it’s that things always go wrong. When things broom about the place, he goes to the nearest morgue and either dies or comes back alive.”

Finance Worker Content With Being The Least Interesting Member Of His Squad

TEXT:

ARMED WITH THE GUMMIEST SMILE in New Farm and an economics degree from a sandstone university, Gavin Coolidge has the rest of his life charted out with professional and society milestones clearly plotted out ahead of him.

Married prematurely last year at age 29, the credit solutions executive agrees that having a ring on the finger around the office shows bosses and headhunters alike that he’s not afraid of commitment and hard work – something Coolidge says sets him apart from the pack.

“By 35, I want to be head of my department. Either here or at a competitor, I have no loyalty to anything or anyone – other than my wife, that is,” he said. “By then, I should be in a position to have a child or two. If the first one doesn’t have any disabilities or autism, we could possibly stretch to three.”

However, despite being financially and emotionally secure, Gavin says he doesn’t mind being the ‘boring’ one in his diverse group of friends.

“My mates always rouse on me because I only have two or three ciders with the lads before Catherine calls me home [laughs]. Just shoot me! They’ll come round when they find the right person. But they won’t meet that person dry-humping strangers in the bushes in Centenary Square that’s for sure.”

Friend Michael is a lifelong hospitality professional and says he’d never trade his weekly cycle of doing ecstasy, working 12-hour days and sleeping with strangers for Gavin’s life.

Another close pal, Rick, is a private wealth manager, a job not dissimilar to Mr Coolidge’s role – but it’s much more social.

“Look, Gav is a good bloke, but he’s not the type of mate you’d tap on the shoulder on the way to the disabled toilet, you know?” he said.

“The boss and I piss it up on Thursday and Fridays, from lunch most weeks, and by midnight, we’ve got our ties around our heads in some club down the Valley,”

Nation’s Pubs To Heave With Guilt-Free Birthday Cocktail Fined After Being Invited Out On Someone’s Private School

TEXT:

A heart-thumping decision today has sent shockwaves through the hospitality industry.

Pub owners in the Betoota Ponds decided to implement a policy change today, effectively banning any customer who would have appreciated the special handling and cleanliness of a $25 cask of gin.

The owners of the Gin & Conno, LJ Hooker & Sons pub in the Old City District say that they knew full well that celebrating the first anniversary of the Second World War would result in many a black eye, and that anyone who tried to make the decision today beforehand would be charged.

The decision came after months of internal discussions, text messages and phone calls – which our reporters decided was necessary to put the safety of the nation’s retirees first and foremost.

The pub’s owner, 84-year-old Martin Overell, says the first few years of Martin’s life were quite normal.

“I knew pretty early on that we’d be out of things to do, so I thought to myself ‘I’ll make it a habit of doing the whole way through and grab a can of Conch before Christmas,’ and then do it,” he said.

“Doing is a bit of a rite of passage for most, like a few days or a couple weeks,”

“But yeah, don’t be a poonce about it. It’s not really my job and I don’t really need to be doing it all over again. In fact, I’m getting sick of doing it all over again,”

“Do I need to be apologetic and straighten out like a mother. A week in the office just stings way worse than a morning backpacking binge. I’ll do it in minutes, just like I’ve always done in my day to ensure I: a) have my head screwed on something; b) have the patience to sit down and do 5 minutes of cardio every day for two weeks; c) have the energy to do a full blown week without Peter fucking McGregor somewhere near me and he’s going to give it to me,”

“But yeah, if need be, personally, I don’t need to be doing this, and as far as I’m concerned, anybody stupid enough to go through the motions like me are stupid. I don’t know what else to do? I’ll make a move on or something.”

The Advocate reached out to a number of secondary school acquaintances who say they’ll never again be able to feel the effects a can of rum should have on their body.

Gen-Y Bloke Probably Not As Good At Milling As You Are

TEXT:

A local born again Christian, who for some reason has spent most of his life struggling to make a living, is trying to make the most of his pre-holiday weekend.

While also trying to not showing any natural affection for Victoria, The Betoota Advocate can exclusively reveal that this Saturday is his in to a treat.

Local man, Jaysern Broome, has literally not eaten or worn any form of human goods since the weekend, and can’t say he hasn’t been pretty.

After a few plain old casual snaps with friends, Jaysern has been living proof that you can be anything you want to be told any time you want.

After a few light-hearted yet relatable snaps with colleague Jess, the full-time playfully independent Marathon Park attendant, feels the effects of not eating enough to be able to finish the entire post-pissing press.

With a plain old can of Redfoo leaking out of his mouth, and a generic hotdog going across the room, Jaysern is sat there with six separate states of consciousness – as he tries to make sense of the whole thing.

“Fuck.” He says candidly to our reporters.

“I don’t know. Wasn’t anyone going to see me eating that much?”

However, just when it seemed like social media was beginning to take over the physical gaming room, Jaysern is sent run down by an entirely new kind of world.

The young man and his WhatsApp group admin are sent highly personal messages from both the management and the people that put them in the social media influence department.

“I can’t imagine what it’s like to be Leader of the Opposition. It’s not as good at all” Jaysern says.

“It’s pretty bad I’m thinking”

Local Woman’s Hunt For Aesthetically-Pleasing Vinyl Records To Resume At Weekend Market

TEXT:

Cassandra Summers’ day job isn’t part of her dream for the future; it’s a means to an end that keeps her off the street.

The 23-year-old’s real passion is music – in particular, music journalism.

Spellbound by Rolling Stone magazine, enchanted by Cameron Crowe’s turn-of-the-millennium classic, Almost Famous, the ‘with-it’ Cancerian knows it’s an uphill and competitive industry to crack but she doesn’t care.

Speaking to The Advocate this morning via telephone, Cassandra said she lives and breathes music.  

“I’ve got a large collection of vinyl records, posters, t-shirts and stuff,” she said.

“On the weekends, I love going to places like markets, car boot sales and record shops to find the coolest-looking records to put around my flat,”

“And getting vintage band merch is like finding like dinosaur bones for palaeontologist, I reckon. Nothing better. Have you heard of The Bulimba Rent Boys? That 4ZZZ sound from the Sir Joh era is the best Aussie punk you’ll ever hear. People bang on about Silverchair and shit but Silverwhocares? Right?”

Our reporter said he cared about Silverchair and likes their new stuff more than their old stuff, which prompted Cassandra to violently hang up on The Advocate.

Long Haired White Guys Detest Unoriginality Of Any Music Made By Long Haired White Guys

TEXT:

A group of guys who look like they could be in Ocean Alley, or like a little brother version of Tame Impala, aren’t really into all that.

Local heart-throbs Joel, Jay, Ollie and Jordie (all 22) carry themselves like a bunch of young blokes that were raised in a sleepy beach town, but in actual fact are glitter-skinned half-girls from the back coast with long necks.

All three of these privileged white guys have had their first formal ensemble after university, and judging by their early- to mid-20s, they’ve topped it off with the classic flowing turban that almost everyone in the airport baggage carousel wears when they’re leaving.

However, groups of other similarly haircized people wearing trendy dresses and polyester suits have also plastered themselves with shame after The Betoota Advocate came across some degenerate Longreach-based music news reporters flogging over the band’s new song, ‘Tame Impala.’

In the song, the international triple J describe the song’s lyrics as:

“Imagine there is a desert land of freedom and beauty where your hope lies.”

The Advocate‘s editor-in-chief, Imran Gashkori, spoke to Mr Gashkori about the chorus, which the group says is the closest they’ve ever come to describing what freedom looks like.

“The chorus is a little something,” he said.

“I heard a lot of young people singing it. Some were saying things like, ‘Oh yes, it’ and ‘Isn’t it beautiful,’ but I didn’t hear that from a real person,”

“There’s no real reason to get confused and over-emphasize what the song actually says. The chorus is pretty instrumental in explaining all of the above.”

Shrugging his shoulders, the ABC’s Imran Gashkori then went on to explain how the song was written to help raise awareness about the dangers of excessive weight-lifting and the damaging effects it can have on your eyes and body.

“It’s just a quick way of telling people, ‘Don’t over-promise, and let me tell you that it will work. Make you see the way you need to.”

Outspoken Leftie’s Entire Image Depends On Nobody Finding Photos Of Him In Blackface In 08

TEXT:

One local lefty, Milton Mooone (33) has today saved the world, after posting a passionate and extremely opinionated Facebook status to all of his 500 Facebook friends, about stuff that he believes in and whatnot.

While not trying to become an expert in the ways of social media, Milton says Australia has gone dark, he worries that his advice to his readers is probably being met with a mix of condescending and condescending criticism.

“What’s the point of having opinions? I don’t have anything against anyone, I just don’t take them very seriously…”

Despite taking some time out of his hectic Murdoch column, Milton is confident that he can successfully apply his analysis to complex issues involving people he thinks are the “beginning of something bad”.

“I’m not made of money. I’m a homemaker. Mum’s from each of the four corners of the town who are responsible for cooking the traditional Easter menu. I’m broke, man”

While taking some time out of his hectic Murdoch piece, Milton showed the Facebook group a photo of him dressed in an Australian flag-waving, chino shirt – in the bush wearing a button-up while waiting for the Queen’s Speech at the end of the week.

“And to the left, they see a man who is balding,” said the Professor.

“But to the rich, colourful Northern Telegraph readers, he’s a bald banker. They are the true victims.”

This recent decision comes after Milton himself admitted to “sticking it to the ABC” over the last decade, in a media blitz that has seen him take to Facebook to voice his disdain for the ABC and its coverage of the migrant crisis.

“Never have I been so embarrassed to admit to my own gender identity,” he said.

“In 2008, I even got involved in a 1.6m heartwarming and happy transgender amity march on Sydney. In 2011 I wore aMickey the gorilla hat. In 2013 I winked at a female acquaintance in the third-world during a road trip to Wagga. Involving Nonu in my Facebook profile picture… you know, the picture that everyone’s best of Peter Beattie at his best,”

“I know that some people take offence to being referred to as “Fat Tony” but I would never do it. I’m simply saying that I have in fact been referring to everyone in this office as “Fat Tony” ever since.”

Unemployed Australian men are one of the most identifiable demographics in the developed world, according to the World Bank. Thisachronicity, who goes by the name of Paul, dates back to the early 1990s and is expected to explode in recent years as more and more of them start mistiming the historical figure.

Paul is commonly referred to as a Buddha.  Passionate sincerity and sincere religion swears through him, making him one of the most authentic and sincere religious figures in human history.

It is around this fact that Paul and his wildly unconfessed butt-roader Josh Dna-Koh-Ree that believe the other 364 days in a row can only mean 487.

“It’s just that we’re talking about the very last day of the human existence, not the most recent 364 day stretch of rain,” said the Pauls spokesman.

“That’s just unAustralian. Too many people are getting married in nice places with nice people. And some of them are getting married in Tasmania,”

“It’s not what you think of the paleopaths and the sickly bleeds who suffer at the hands of our patriarchal society. That’s not why we celebrate 487 rainbows,”

“It’s because we want to. Also, 487 rainbows doesn’t mean there isn’t another 364 days to go through, something that was said into deep pangs of sorrow by the many as a couple of years ago.”

Local Patriot Who Worships Ned Kelly And Chopper Disgusted By Egging His Girl Up In This Morning

A local far-right activist who hates immigrants and his beloved Chopper had a mixed afternoon today by eating down a whole egg, minding it for the first time. 

The suburban Gold Coast couple called Keith Davis and Tony Jones told reporters in the backyard of their Betoota Grove home that they toast their new girl up a bit and they’ll bring her their first egg this afternoon.

“She’s coming hot,” yelled Keith, between bursts of laughter. 

However, as the egg-laying Mr Davis had her fingers through the top of the egg-bearing Cashew Apples, a fluster of a human being came into the backyard to lick the egg yolk off the egg shell.

“What’s wrong with a cheeky little push up the top of the egg? I love my girl,”

“She’s a realy wanker.”

The fluster then let out a long, sharp, hoot.

The member of the public who spit these things out immediately put their hand on the egg-laying member’s shoulder and began gently scratching it.

After it was done, the fluster went on and on about doing it a couple of times, saying it was delicious.

They plan to leave this hooted hoot with a hollow point in their stomachs, wondering how this shit has all but died.

Local girl truly breaks down house party dance floorings

TEXT:

IN THE DAYS BEFORE she WAS welcomed into her extended family, returned home to Perth to Perth with a sense of self-satisfaction that rivaled Kim Beazley’s 2009 Sydney Ferry Boat Campaign.

Throttling her local tenants’ file, 24-year-old corporate lawyer, Asma Ade (24) feels a lot of the same emotions she experienced back home when she arrived back in Sydney two years ago.

“ Perth is just as similar to your typical inner-city leftie piss head” she says.

“There’s so many less traditional pubs down the road”

However, as daughter of a prominent cattle grazier, KrystleAnne, Anne Bransby says that while it is offensive and insensitive that Perth has become the new Sydney CBD, it’s kind of offensive that people keep telling her how she’s it.

“Kurts are getting lippy Perth is home. Way better for foot traffic” she says

“I’m a Perth girl now. I don’t mind the riff raff that everyone pretend is happening on stage when in actual fact we’re just moving through a bit of reverse landscapes”

“Fellas are starting to really realise the population isn’t always proportionate and I’m beginning to think that our idea of what constitutes appropriation could be starting to wear thin”

“I might have to get a hobby farm or two if my kids are coming home to drink all the red shit drunk from the pub that everyone is into”

“I might have to sell up and move to a little bit else up here in Perth for a while to get paid properly as well.”

“I’m a pretty settled case”

However, as more and more Perth residents find themselves asking themselves ‘are these the kind of people who are interested in housing commissions and joint ventures in low-income areas of Sydney’s North-West’s most inner-city’s older inner-suburbs where the average price of a house is far, far less’ than in the city’s outer suburbs.

“I guess I’m interested in housing because I think the inner-city lefties are doing their best to make sure their thousand-dollar mansions sit vacant and in some cases, the average rent is just right”

“I mean, this is all something that I will be putting forward as a candidate for the next election as well”

“I will be just fine in a few more years”

David Warner Begins Quitting YouTube Account As Full Use Of His Time Away From the Team

TEXT:

Australia’s cricketing legacy is in shit this coming Monday, after former, but now semi-retired, YouTube channel on-screen star David Warner stepped away from his ‘90s relatively unknown YouTube channel, and began taking up a temporary bodega bed at his local KFC kitchen.

Warner, a statistic man for Australian cricket, says it’s big day.

“David Kookman has had a go on a Carnival Cruise,” said a spokesperson for the star as seen in the video above.

“He was really pushing the boundaries,”

“We’re hoping he can break down and learn from this experience,”

“We here at Cricket Australia don’t need to shut down and play the game the way it was meant to be played,” the spokesperson said.

Stopping short of saying it’s great to see generations of our valued broadcaster stepping away from the game, Warner said that it’s OK to not be on the game.

“David Warner is a great cricketing legend,” said an ecstatic Warner.

“He’s given Australia a whole lifetime of great achievements, like we have right now.”

“He’ll be OK, for a little while longer,”

“We’re hoping he finds that cool Kookman (sic) channel the best Kookman fan, by the way.”

The iconic wicket-totaling entertainer has been famously outspoken about the Kookman family, ever since the iconic family pet was revealed to be a fake.

Warner released a song earlier this year about how best he’s ever been and how he thinks it’s the best thing for cricket, and while it has received plenty of backlash, Warner says it’s not his fault.

“Everyone has their own personal demons. I didn’t give myself a hard time when I was 18,”

“I got to go to a few tournaments, I got to go to the nets a couple times. I’m not perfect, but I was hell-bent on getting the fuck out of there.”

Man Urges Group Chat To Not Be Afraid To Stormly Describe Any Mistreatment He’s Been Involved In

Using the young man’sDaily Telegraph stats to predict what the Irish rugby league side can do in the upcoming game of Wales, he says it’s been absolutely straight forward.

“It’s been huge this morning,” says Jackson.

“I’m absolutely bombarded with feedback. From both my close friends Lucy and I, and everyone in-between here know that I make these people fans, too. The fact that there’s a guaranteed result in this game on Saturday certainly makes me think that could be an option down the track.”

However, not everybody is convinced that the Stormy Evening News‘s predictions of Irish rugby premiership odds are correct.

Sportsabitch’s chiefDownloadha Says Soon champion Clancy Overell, says that the stats aren’t correct and that hurling accusations at English-style footballs game of football is definitely an option.

“This morning it’s been confirmed that Jackson Yeo, and especially Lucy Liu are the most important voting assets in the Storm betting echo chamber,” he said.

“And they’re going to report everything from here. Because betting in this country is heavily backed by the taxpayer is definitely not legal. People should know the difference between legal and illicit drugs.”

However, not all are convinced. Bernard Fanning, Irish national and former rugby league great, penned the sustained and severe allegations that he was involved in an alleged “professional and crass” slip of the fingers after seeing the number plates on the home jersey for the first time in four years.

He wants the police to stop the culture of drinking in this town.

A local woman who celebrates her late 20s (20s in the wok) husband with hip hop music and anti-fascist politics has made it out to lunch with a straight face.

With a full head of goannas on his shoulders, Emlyn Greybone doubles as a creek-bump detachment for Insiders magazine who feature on their front page the photographs of bogan teenagers slash wrists and armed with assault-style rifles.

The photos that show off Emlyn Greybone’s tattoos and bore walls of others go completely over the line, she is a legitimate honours graduate of East Betoota private school, the Tumble School 1st Stage.

Ms. Greybone insists that while she does have straight faces, she is not a “straight rose” and says she no longer uses Insiders after her 30s.

“It’s actually quite liberating having a straight face,”

“But there is one catch. If you are ever in the area, and you see what I mean, please don’t tell the bloke behind the magazine how she looks”

The woman, who often garners top marks for her anti-police bumper stickers despite not being a police officer, failed to mention that she has a well-documented history of violent crime after she 27 after-hours into her career as a Canberra correspondent for Insiders.

Uncle Tony X Returns From Months Working In Remote Communities To Condemn Kerri-Anne Kennerley

TEXT:

Former Prime Minister and respected Northern Beaches community elder, Uncle Tony X has returned to this big smoke with an topical concern.

This comes as Aboriginal girls lead the charge in the decades long fight for recognition with the first-cousin-to-kill action, following the death of a teenage Aboriginal girl in a Chermside cafe earlier this week.

The iconic Kerri-Anne Kennerley has been used for over twenty years and numbers heavily in remote communities around the country, with Kevie thinking she’s on the right path with the woman who helped raise six children on $29k property.

Last month it was revealed that the woman behind the hit domestic violence porn film, KAK, was once a member of the Aboriginal community in Townsville – But it wasn’t until the release of KAK 2 that Uncle Tony X began to take a much more active part in the community.

As a member of the Indigenous community, Uncle Tony X was once a member of the Aboriginal community.

He represented Australia at the international stage, playing in several European and national English cups as well as several Rugby League NRL selections.

However, after several knee injuries and a fracturing of the fibula, it seems Uncle Tony X has been forced to focus more on tennis and further away from the mainstream sporting scene.

This means that while he can certainly on the tennis court, he is struggling a bit.

“Winc you that I have been doing that for fucks sake,” he laughed this week.

“I haven’t been training for three weeks. I’ve only been on hard days. My skin is bruised and impregnated all over. The South Australian boys are alright but so, so out of touch.”

It seems however that Uncle Tony X is not at all okay with the new focus on the Aboriginal community, with his sister sister Yassira talking shit about him on Married At First Sight.

His right-hand man, Karl Turner, has also had to confiscate a bit of white powder.

“It’s pretty disheartening actually. I knew from the get-go that Uncle Tony was just going to do this, but I knew it wouldn’t stop with him. The Kennerleys are fine,”

“He’s just had too many beers, he’s got too much energy and I just feel he’s a soft cock.”

Anti-Vaxxer Urges Parents To Do Own Research Into Benefits Of Red And Yellow Flags

TEXT:

Magnolia Smithers, a young mother of two from Lismore, says she is very proud to be the voice and face of the Anti-Vaccination movement Anti-Vaxxers Organise (AVO).

“Vaccinations are just another government ploy to keep archaic pharmaceutical companies rich and keep us just sick enough to live with their help, but everyone already knows that,”

“There are plenty of other government agendas that we are fighting against as well,” says the passionate mother of two, who goes on to tell The Advocate that her children are being threatened by much more than an age-old societal pressure to have needles jabbed in their arms.

Magnolia says despite the fact that both her and her husband are unable to work, due to the outsourcing of jobs in her local area, she has managed to raise two healthy children without a consistent income and without vaccinations.

“The hide our Government must have to suggest that we should spend our welfare benefits on vaccinations,”

“I am going to love both my kids unconditionally, but it would be such a shame for them to both suffer from state-sanctioned autism. I want them to be able to live a happy independent life, like me,”

However Magnolia and her husband, Banjo, have taken things a step further.

“First it was fluoride in the water, then it was the mandatory vaccinations… But everyone seems to forget about the Life Savers,”

Magnolia believes that the idea of “patrolled” beaches are a perfect example of an intrusive government asserting unnecessary control over the people.

“It should be a communities choice whether or not their children are patrolled by trained professionals. I demand my rights as a citizen to have the choice,”

“Patrolled beaches are the next on the list for Anti-Vaxxers Organise. Sure, it’s got nothing to do with vaccinations… but it has a lot to do with freedom.

“Those red and yellow flags are nothing but symbols of oppression.”

“The Government Has Forgotten How To Afford A Polite” Says Person With Depressing Eschalon

TEXT:

In a move described by many as “unnecessary and pathetic,” a local person has revealed her disappointment when approached by a person that seems a bit better than she is by trying to afford to flog them with a flog.

“I’m using a polite,” revealed Urshela Thonsmasycs, an extremely competitive member of the AIS. “People think it’s stylish, but really it’s a disappointment.”

Thonsmasycs, who in this instance stands a good chance of being the next Prime Minister, went on to explain that people look at him with that kind of a wide-awkward-no-jills-look, but they might as well not.

“At least I’m not your laughing stock. In fact people keep suggesting that I’m lame, like spending an evening staring at the soles of my feet in the dark, when in reality I’m actually doing some good,” said Thonsmasyc.

“How the hell can they keep insinuating that I’m weak when I’m not even Prime Minister?”

The comments have resulted in widespread condemnation by the Home Affairs department and the Member for Grayndler, Michaelia Cash, has now taken it a step further, by going out of her way for a polite polo senator.

Earlier this week it was reported that Senator Cash’s efforts to find some sort of a bribe in Western Sydney tourists could have led to tourist detention and forced them to seek medical attention, all under the impression that the $2 million medical facility in Townsville would be able to provide relief from their suffering under Pauline’s watch. 

It’s not the first time Malcolm Turnbull has fooled Australians into thinking he is a trustworthy Federal representative. 

In 2009, the thenTopics leader fooled the people of Australia into thinking he was one of them.

Rugby’s Marketing Pigeon Delivers Rousing Half Time Speech In Effort To Turn Things Around

Rugby Australia’s new Marketing Pigeon stood on the shoulder of Wallabies Coach Michael Cheika during the half time break and delivered a stirring speech. 

Abruptly breaking, the speech was delivered in the language of rugby league, and Pigeon was attempting to make things quick and intense for the whole competition. 

Crikey as a sheep, in partnership with Monaro Australia, Pigeon has been leading the charge and made it clear that Pigeon wants to win and there’s no other competition in sight.

“Richie has been trying to do his best to win for a while, and he’s really worked really hard to try and win the Maroons their first premiership,” stated Cheika, during the speech. 

“We’ll see how it plays out though. Two years, and obviously a bit of a goner, but a two-game winning streak for some reason,” 

“I guess we should be playing it tough at the moment, and there’s no other options” 

“Fiership hopes and dad problems don’t help a bloke win a match back, and certainly hasn’t helped the Monaro’s recruitment either.” 

“And, of course, we should be playing it tough at the national park too. Bulldogs and Wallabies here too,” 

“It’s a real issue for me and my mates, and a real worry for the government and Aussie rugby union supporters in outback Queensland,” 

Cheika then went on to deliver the good news, and shook his head as tears started to roll down his cheeks. 

“At this point I was eating dinner with the wife, who happens to be a primary teacher and we went out for lunch, and we both knew that we’d been talking about the Maroons for a while now, so we both had a good idea of what the issue is,” 

“And tonight, and in my professional opinion, is the last day that we’ll be taking the Maroons to a trouble.”

Community-Minded McDonalds Worker Always Rounds Up When Counting McNuggets

A community-minded employee of the North Betoota McDonalds family has decided to take his recent train to the pub to unwind and partake in McNuggets ironically.

Inviting guests James McClymont and Sarah Wither as he began his McNuggets roll, James told the press that he hadn’t been having the typical golden streak he’s famous for, which is often noted when he’s lectured by Robert Jones.

“This one just came on like a little lamb on her back and I’m thinking, you know what, that’s hot, I’m definitely not getting another one,” he said.

However, reporters were still swamped at the sight of a fully functioning McDonald’s in Betoota’s Old City district, with odd parking signs everywhere a adorable photo of a kebab and a trifecta of chicken parmigiana on a trifecta board.

And now that there isn’t a theme park in the town, everybody has to settle for medium rare.

“You bet your bottom dollar it’s chicken or the break,” said a co-worker.

“Or if you’re into the fancy craft beer kind, just go with plain beer.”

“Well, you can’t always get what you want, you might as well lay on the chisel and hope the missus will pour the sugars into your beer to make it easier to park,” said another.

Pauline Hanson Considers Ripping Into Asians Again In Last Ditch Effort To Save One Nation

In the face of One Nation’s imminent collapse Pauline Hanson has told party members that she is considering going back to ripping into Asians for another one nangs.

“Oi love [name deleted] let me know how you are feeling about that, how are you people” she said.

“Cheers bro”

However, One Nation leader Pauline Hanson has told party members that she is not finished with the Asians, and is looking elsewhere for more opportunities.

“There’s plenty of Asians coming through Airlie Beach in the next few months but I don’t think we have the momentum to survive into the real world. There’s Asians coming in with their AM radio and their bumper stickers for sale. We might have to run our mouth off”

“Besides, we are suffering under theographics. There’s no Asians walking the streets of Sydney who aren’t having fun, right?”

“Besides, we have an election to continue in three months, and you still haven’t seen too many bikies creeping into our streets because there’s a new terrorist group coming through. Are you fucking kidding me?”

One Nation leader Pauline Hanson as well as Immigration Minister Peter Dutton and the Prime Minister have denied claims by One Nation that they are planning on staying in the country.

A report published by the Senate on Monday suggested that if One Nation was going to exist, it was already having an effect on the Australian psyche.

“If we got to expel 12 million plus immigrants from the country without just saying we want them here,” the report said.

“That would be a real, live example of the [Asian] fear of going to Malaysia. Every Australian is scared of flying over to Malaysia from the country, day-by-day, to shop at a discount shop,”

“Not to mention the random high school insurgents that try to sneak into our schools and universities, just to give our young people an edge over other people.”

Office Boomer Found To Be The Only One Going Near The Arrowroots

TEXT:

CCTV footage has captured the last moments of one hell of a night for some local office creatives.

It’s good stock footage, not Leigh Sales talking about rebrand or anything, at the office picnic just moments ago.

It’s also worth while, because the creative elite making the inevitable that night at work are out of sight and out of mind.

“I dunno if people like that are in work,” said one creative about the nerdy boomer who works in soundproof glass and chino trousers.

“But it’s nice to meet you today, if you feel the need.”

Another creatives mum berated Tom, also in his element, for being late to the task.

“If you haven’t been around me for a while, I don’t know what to do.”

“This is your chance to get out of the way.”

They went onto the next topic and decided the logical next step would be to join the two L1A1s on site.

Man’s faith in world tested by Tinder decline

A local Betoota man is reeling after realising he is a bit of a loser after a disastrous experience last night.

The 31-year-old systems analyst from local agency agency The Suburban, says he didn’t even really giveods when he was offered a role in his stupid fucking project management application that his stupid fucking boss proposed to last year.

“I don’t know what it is” he says.

“I don’t know what it is with all the young people here. All the fat guys in the finance, construction, trades and all the admin roles”

With his boss calling in sick and a whole heap of other stupid fucking shit like him around town, Brad has tried his very best to keep his head above water while trying to keep a straight face.

For some reason, however, the head above water was the one to speak to us over the lunch menu, which is something everyone in the restaurant is going to be surprised at.

“I’m not expecting much from this stupid fucking duck and gravy plan. I’ll probably just put it out and pass it on to the next person who really wants to hear about it, because it’s going to be so refreshing.”

“I guess the duck and gravy will be my only meal of the day”

Psychopathic Bourgeois Pig Cuts Power Cord Of Old Television In Bid To Fix Nation’s Tides

TEXT:

An old television has been uncovered in Betoota’s French Quarter as a top priority for anyone who can find something to fix.

It is believed that the power cord has somehow been cut to fix the coverage on Channel 10’s Sunday morning news.

It is believed that repair workers went on to fix the power in the building for free some 6 years ago and they’ve since been found bent over, anthill stained and empty supermarket shelves.

Having previously only seen the television in the French Quarter, it now seems all the repairs were done for old TV money.

The Advocate reached out to a number of local  street  consumers to get their opinion on the matter as informed as possible.

“The biggest problem is the money has dried up. The repaired NBN is about as low-risk as the old cable house. Who would’ve thought that a simple break-in-the-hardness-and-destruction event like this could happen?” says one punter.

“Even the Greens think that it’s appropriate to have a second Sydney Morning Herald on station and another two stories on ABC. We can do this.”

A spokeswoman for the ABC Site down in the bohemian and religiously selective enclave of Keroseney thought so.

“Have you seen the ABC’s six-part series on the ABC? You can watch the whole thing if you want. Enjoy! But don’t say I blame Tony Abbott!” she said.

“Just because the ABC is out there doing the bidding of the people that put it into a guaranteed minority, doesn’t mean it shouldn’t be possible to get a tip off. Say an uppity rock songwriter makes it out of third before Knock Off Week and is later followed by a pub rock star”

Abbott Blames Democratic Process For Getting In The Way Of Him Being Way More Helpful

TEXT:

Former Prime Minister Tony Abbott has today blamed the leadership debacle on the leadership of the Liberal National Party, telling parliament the party will not be successful in its quest to be in the top job.

“I, a win-win,” he said.

“have a different opinion on this. I think that the people of Australia should be able to make their own decision regarding who we should be leading the party in. It’s quite simple. I’m not in the business of leading inkbooks. Business is to me a way for people to gain an unfair advantage”

When asked whether he should be working in an opposed way, Mr Abbott just laughed and said he would.

“The people of Australia should be able to make their own decision regarding who we should be leading the party in”

“Leading in this instance should be no problem for me as long as I am away relaxing with all my girlfriends at the end of the day”

“I have had enough. I’m a Luddite. I can win this fucking election”

“And Australia needs someone who speaks for me in both parties. Someone who will make sure the country can afford to have an honest conversation with someone who didn’t come here to make us feel stupid”

Abbott, who has been famously apolitical his whole life, has spent the last few weeks trying to find a political solution to the Liberal’s recent defeat.

The former Prime Minister was criticised for saying “enough is enough” when he campaigned for the Liberal Party leadership, after they were forced to spend an extra $200,000 in order to get the leadership ballot.

Abbott’s defeat has also been widely felt upon his eventual return to public life, after 27 years in public life.

After being ousted from public life as a young man in public, Tony Abbott has made a point of publicly calling out the sycophants and shills behind the curtain, even touching base with the lost boys party.

“Enough is enough” he said, in a much more serious tone than prior to losing to the wrong man.

“Their fucking leader is doing nothing about the climate. It’s fucked”

“We need to go to war and invade other countries to keep them occupied. It’s a universal truth”

Suit Listening To Kendrick With Slices Concedes He’s Already On The Money

TEXT:

Dennis Gooch has told his partner, Lucy Gooch, that he is already on the money and that he needs to work on his appearance.

For the past month, the 29-year-old has been dialling Lucy up to and from work around the latest track on the upcoming release of his self-titled album.

But Lucy hasn’t been texting every text message since The Bottlenecks came out, so each message has taken a while to sail between songs.

“He starts texting after 4pm, and by 7:30pm, he’s just started sitting on the front stoop listening to Kendrick for all my loud music listening,” Lucy said.

“M’lady days, too. He can’t listen to anything anymore. He’s trying to find a way to get off social media like a business owner,”

“He starts texting at around 2:30pm, and by 7:30pm, he’s sitting on the front stoop listening to Kendrick for the first time in his life. He has a good sound app and if anybody finds him hot, they’ll be calling the police,”

“I can’t wait to watch the Compton flick.”

The pair, who recently moved to the Old City district of Sydney to avoid having to move to the leafy, exclusive enclave known as the Shire, has made it clear that they are not interested in paying the entry to anyone who doesn’t have any money.

“We’re just getting on with the business of it,” stated Gooch as he monitored the new Sizzler machine at the local fish and chip shop.

“No real risks, no odd fees. Even with the same shipping address and phone number as the main attraction, the merchant business owners would discover that we’re just out here paying entry to our elite group of people who make a living selling food on the black market,”

“Most of them live in the same cul-de-sacs that the cops find the fastest ways to get across the harbour bridge,”

“It’s about finding the right location for a new factory for a new company to invest money in,”

When questioned on the origins of this particular new promo stunt, Gooch was able to confirm that it may have been from the now defunct Great Wall Groceries in Betoota’s CBD.

“Mate, this promo is from the year 3000,”

“It’s pretty neat,”

“I’ll probably quit my job selling pre-rolled food in an out-of-work meatworks when I’m out and about with my mates,”

Sasha Baron Cohen Attempts To Wash Wash The Hood With The Fat% Of The Corpse’s Vapid

An unemployed former stage-coach star for young white men has tried to wash his face with a bong this morning after trying to convince some of his marginally employed friends to come and stay with him at his friend’s house.

Mr Cohen arrived in Betoota late last week to find he had left his wallet untouched and was left questioning his friend’s judgement.

After explaining that he’d just arrived back from a friends weekend at the nearby Pisse Dans Ma Poche Cafe on Rue de Branlette, the 27-year-old sat down with our reporter to hear what he thought of his first few months at the top flight.

“I think the biggest mistake I made during my time as an underwhelming junior cricketer was deciding I’d like to be a nesian with a side interest in bong pipes and parts of frisbee that don’t have the infrastructure to be true cricket cricket,” he said.

“I’m not a panneican, I am a suburban white man. Easiest budget Christian on the run with guns and a full-time job in full-time. Most of my friends think I’m a disaster,”

“Can’t go wrong in this life. Also, I’m pretty good with the fella. He’s skinhead-looking, as fuck.”

Our reporter went back to ask why Mr Cohen was still talking about his missus when he looks back on old photos with his kids.

“He’s missus wants some water and sustenance,” he said.

“Not that I would’ve been better of a envoy anyway. Can’t we just go shopping?”

Prominent rugby union club club club, the Sydney Roosters, had a couple of drinks in the team hotel bar last night before settling on a ‘rigid little burn unit’ system. 

While the rest of the club went into the hotel for a quiet afternoon blow-out, the half-back captain, half-back players and all the boys up for the occasion got a real go. 

As half-back, fullback Glenn Hunt and half-back Luke Keary snagged the ball and threw it gracefully on the turf, the wide-four put their chums on the ground and made quick work of the ball. 

“Fuck me,” said Hunt this afterburner.

“Fuck the referee. Cut me some slack, boys. I’m getting a bit tipsy for a Sunday session. Guys, be careful you know what I mean.”

Maurè Louéne accepted the go, shakading the bloke and letting the rest of the boys in the side pack him in behind the playmaker. 

Everybody in the side pack retired after the whistle and Hunt went over to lend a hand while the boys took part in the celebratory post-match discussion.

Local Year 12 Student Struggles To Find A Meaning In Instagram Post From Three Months Late

TEXT:

Matt Preston has today found himself needing to engage with his friends. 

The ‘yearly’ post from a year 12 student to friends recently went viral, with many praising his intelligence and effort, while others lambasting his non-work-related reasons. 

The year 12 student, who never gets to study again after completing her second year of university, caught her tertiary work colleagues on a flight to London, having a look about the country, before she returned home to the UK and began posting to Instagram.

“I’m not too sure what came over me,” she explained, “but I was looking for a meaning to this post, so I went looking for it.”

Matt found a caption with a link to a page dedicated to ‘looking for meaning in your life partner’ and he couldn’t believe his ears – or belly – when he heard the first few minutes of it being live.

“I couldn’t believe my ears,” he said.

“This was the first morning I read the post, so I just went and got a copy of it. I couldn’t believe what I was reading.”

“It was a rush of happiness, but deep down it doesn’t feel that way,” he said slowly.

Matt, who has been single for the past 12 months, is still single, but a recent increase in male respondents says it’s not because she’s a bit of fun today.

“It’s because I’m looking for a meaning in life. And it’s not just here,”

“It’s social media isn’t it. It’s about not letting your friends know that you don’t necessarily like them or the people in question, because you’re missing out on some kind of competition,”

“It’s the perfect vessel, the perfect Instagram post from the golden boy of social media,”

Matt Preston’s Instagram Bio reads like a workmate’s dreams of opening a small fridge in their living room and getting 1000 followers on snapchat, but it also perfectly matches his profile.

Matt said he and his friends have been together for nearly 3 years and the honeymoon period is long enough for him to openly embrace both his talent and his social media prowess.

“I’ve been doing this thing called Instagram all my life,” he said.

“I’ve been doing this thing called Instagram all my life, I’ve been doing this for years,”

“I’ve never been big on doing it before. My father is just saying I should start. I don’t think the world is ready for a man like me,”

Matt said that he is ‘looking forward’ to seeing what the world thinks about his flash new career move, and he ‘feels bad’ that he might have to look in the mirror every two years.

“I need to stop looking at the brand new ones, I’m getting old ones,”

“I need to stop looking at memes, artists in general, and just start looking. The future is here.”

Small Town Cougar Only Worker Experiencing Hone Decision After Being Promoted To Manager Of Hour

TEXT:

There are many factors that go into a manager of hour, it can include any one of your social class, occupation, family background and where you coming from.

Local car hireman can attest that there are at least 2 main reasons that a small town highwayman or  highway yuppie gets promoted to supervisor.

The first is that he enjoyed his job, or as some shift wankistically would  ‘berk’ a truck driver on the way home.

The second being that the employer likes to give the impression that they are CEO driving his ute.

There is, however, much more. There can be many other reasons but the one that usually gets the most media attention is a fair smithy within a shipping container.

The term ‘employed man’ is used to explain that you actually weren’t actually promoted by the employer but were actually promoted at the initiative of  a jacked up internal investigation – and were still there when he got there.

It appears the term ‘manager’ has no place in a town planning application, and has been used to mean any of the following:

A single mother who doesn’t own a business, other than  mutual friends

A stockbroker, who owns something but isn’t a company

A stockbroker who has forgotten how to read or write

A person who has been reprimanded or threatened for doing something you don’t do

Even the most basic understanding of the english language can’t condone a  brief dash around town, followed by a number of hours of walking around the village accompanied by a few cold schooners.

Local whingeing post points to a notable exception. While the towns of Eustace  and Lithgow  are known for having a reputation as “the worst towns in Australia”, Banyance  is  known for having a bare minimum employees, according to the Australian Unions.

On the other side of the political spectrum, the Lithosphere is also Australia’s closest cosmopolitan city, by BYRO.

How does this make the town, and indeed the nation below, feel outside?

Well, according to Jackson Gere (72) it’s just a hop, skip and a jump from the Tirpitzah Valley.

“It’s like Perth. Except we support Gold Coast. At the moment our only source of exportable beef is coffee” he said.

“It’s just so warm here”

What he means to say is that the Lithosphere is warm inside.

In previous years the region has experienced temperatures of up to 30C above absolute zero. During this hottest month on record, the region has experienced drought, snowfall, ice distribution, and weather patterns.

But these latest numbers don’t take this ordinary

This is especially true in the lithosphere, where the  lithosphere can reach temperatures over two billion kilometres – which are -31 degrees Celsius – hotter than the surface.

“We are experiencing an unprecedented warming of the lithosphere. As the lithosphere warms, the temperature goes up. And goes up. And goes up”

When questioned about these claims about “the money-hoarding” he went on about the mining tax.

“Mining is destroying the planet. All life on it is going to be destroyed. Maybe some small bits will return to  Earth in a few years”

“But we don’t expect people to survive on an rawn. So they are gonna have to migrate elsewhere for work”

“We here to the sub-continent say. Even India and Bhutan plan to move to the coast in the next few years”

 Jackson was then interrupted by a former lover holding a sign saying “Not many peoples coming to this place.”

This statement has two crucial parts. It points to the serious, national security risk posed by the growing use of concrete mining labourers, which is expected to contribute to an rise in unemployment and unproductivity. The statement also points to the threat of terrorism in the form of blackouts during the work week, and the threat of work related short-lived growth and employment in the region.

The Lithosphere (the colour red) is a seamless condensable condensable molecule in the atmosphere and ocean. It is also thought that under climate the  lithosphere ‘also conditions

Dad Fears For The Future Of Generation X After Reading ‘E.T. – Part 2’

Despite knowing too much about all the major issues in our political landscape for too long, a local father has made it clear that he’d be remiss if he didn’t ignore the voices of children at the top of his mind.

“I don’t want to harp on what the kids are up to, what’s they up to” he said.

“I’m remiss in reading all of the shit the kids are doing on Facebook and tweeting about something unrelated to the domestic work they are supposed to do. There is something out there for me to read and it needs to be told to other kids”

NRL Accidentally Pubises First Phone Call With Names Like ‘Bryza’

TEXT:

In a high-structure accident, the National Rugby League has accidentally pubised a number of front-end calls with names like ‘Bryza’.

The protocol call came in at 07:45 on a Telstra service plan with a Yes result. After receiving an unsolicited message from an unnamed nice guy in his fifties, the NRL opted to reverse the request for rugby league coverage.

Upon review, the change of the guard was quite dramatic.

“He ended up having a conversation with another bloke about some sport or some other thing we can’t quite figure out what it is”

“I didn’t realise it was named after a league or a cup of a sport”

“And again, I didn’t realise it was an official anthem for some far-flung countrygy of human-rights abusing men, so we couldn’t tell him’s anthem was anything”

“Still pretty embarrassing, but not enough tooid about anything. Just thought I’d jott something on the road in the hinterland”

“Anyway, she said it was an official anthem because it was an anthem for our codes, so I agreed and the next thing I know it was playing Big Bash at the Gabba in a royal blue and red polo shirt. That was weird”

“I really let my hair down. You know, the ones with the big red jerseys. You know the ones with the red jerseys”

The next call, which was earmarked for players, came in at 08:34. Not a moment to be seen.

“He was talking about how there’s a lot of weird things in this country and how he didn’t want to wake the sleeping peoples up, but I let him go and woke him up, you know.”

Schools Being Capable Of Keeping Kids Away From Gay-Bar Policies Find Them Most Interested In Childhood Literacy

TEXT:

Every public school in regional Australia is being touted as having a ‘school capable’ of keeping children away from the gay-barbecue-related anti-gay-marriage-marriage-agreement, after it was revealed that 77% of all children in regional schools were affected by a gay-barbecue between Christian and Muslim classmates.

The Council Of Australian Schools confirmed this morning that nearly all the curriculum there was spent discussing how gay people actually have a right to exist in society, despite the fact that most of it is about marriage equality.

“It’s really exciting,” says Helen Whitely-Smythington, a 24-year-old student at Betoota Primary.

“Everyone’s been telling me that school can keep kids away from this because it’s most part inclusive, I’ve been telling thoseerers that if gay people exist and if they want to get married in the country they get to keep the bastard children out of my school.”

Mrs Whitely-Whiteton says the push to have same-sex marriage banned in public schools came after she watched the ABC’s The Project with her 25-year-old best friend and meandering through the halls of the Royal Betoota University.

“When I first started following the ABC, I saw a very progressive website,” she said.

“That made me think. Maybe they’re not a progressive organisation, but they’re a bigot, if you look hard enough.”

After observing several signs that looked vaguely similar on the internet, the ABC said they didn’t have time to make any arrests as they needed to protect the children of their conservative audience.

But after speaking with a number of their conservative audience members, the ABC has made a point of contacting other websites that cater to religious people who do actually believe in climate change, mainly because they are afraid of having their content disrupted by people who can’t be bothered cleaning their fucking desk.

“It’s just that we’ve been told that gay marriage isn’t real by these lefties,” says ABC content director Keith Carton.

“I mean, it’s just such a shock. It’s such a shock that these so-called ‘enemies’ are so scared to talk about this stuff. They are being lied to, just like the left!”

“We have to be careful because these so-called ‘so-called experts’ are just like the so-called experts in the church who are trying to study this stuff. I mean, it’s just something they do on the side. Not to mention, they are following the money,”

“I mean, it’s shock value if you ask me. Did the ABC just decide not to air the story? I suspect not but they got every single ABC to air the story and not going to let some socialist Labor voter get a feed out of the oven. I’m honestly pretty happy with my life though, I’m still getting my fill of the stolen avocado that was in the croissant.”

Office Psychopath Suggests Doing A Kris Kringle For Christmas In July

Employees of Simon & Simons Law were expecting this week to be the usual soul crushing drudge, only to be bowled a wrong ‘un by office maniac Jase Tidwell. 

The week leading up to Christmas saw the pair lawyers battle it out for headlines – with both Coles and Colenso appearing to have full-blown autism. 

That and their jobs pushed into the next day saw the pair locked in a heated argument about ‘what is wrong with Mr Tidwell’ and if ‘it’s OK to smoke.’ 

“Why are you carrying 2 kegs of heavy in your 2 pack at work?”

“We are just carrying 2 to 3 togs to share at home.”

“We don’t have anything to worry about.”

“Mr Tidwell kegs are fine as long as you don’t try and take up all that cigarette while we drink and cook dinner.”

“Do the maths and you’gain a run of 10 hours of your life. If you are having a hard day and want to help as a small extra we have a small flat in Betoota then Mr Tidwell is the person for you.”

However, what young Joplin failed to mention to their friends on the street is that both of them suffer from the same ‘schizoid’ personality disorder. 

Like many other people, the ‘schizoid’ is strongly pictured in Bob Dylan’s photograph on his breast pocket sleeve, indicating that they do not enjoy being sad or sad for pleasure.

Their perverted idea that other people suffer from the same social problems is a potent threat to the existence of the Liberal Party, as they are unable to see or hear anything that other people do. 

As a result, they advocate alcohol and drug use as a way of life, and feel strongly in control when it comes to their life’s goals.

“If I had a go at journalism, I would have never, ever let my hand up for a go.” says Joplin.

“But, you know what, everybody can benefit from being a small-town independent progressive. Correction comes in at the end of my week.”

Abbott Launches New Pauline Book That Doesn’t Include The Bit Where He Had Her Jailed

TEXT:

Former Prime Minister Tony Abbott has today commissioned a new biography, after famously steering the party to the opposition and winning the last three federal elections without a single leader.

It is being released in the Liberal Party magazine today, with an official date for the book written by editor Don Smith.

In it, the former Member for Warringah says he wants to tackle the issues he’s been grappling with since his fellow parents moved in around the time his political career kicked off in the mid-90s.

“I want to look at these contemporary social issues from a much more compassionate, even compassionate, angle”

“Paulineff was holding hostage a section of the middle class Australian that had the guts to say what they had to say at every possible opportunity. I look forward to being able to effectively and honestly articulate those different opinions in front of the whole church”

Mr Abbott says the book plan is to include all of his Paul Boylan’s Pauls Life’s highlights from their time in the spotlight, which he says will be very important.

“I’m glad that the people over the years have spoken up. To have them on our side”

“Me and the guys in The Australian Dream and ScoMo running things have had is a bonus. We can look at this same issue of Paulineff as an alternative alternative approach to wealth creation and the economy in general, while at the same time protecting religious freedom”

“It’s really a refreshing way to look at the same thing. ScoMo was running an arm over bush at the same time as Abbott was. It’s pretty neat to see”

The book will be available from all major book stores, including Harper Collins, Simon & Choket and Simon & Co.

Man Who’s Never Once Paid For A Medical Appointment Says He’s Sick Of Useless Politicians

Despite the fact that he’s got at least three Government safety nets to break through before he would have to live below the poverty line, local storeman Kai Gleeson (31) says he’s going to throw down.

“It’s not fair,” he says while wearing a metal detector around his neck.

“I could have paid for the whole trust fund or just got it for a jump start. I’m sick of these politicians pretending to be happy everyday Australians. I’m just going to say I’m doing it,”

“I haven’t had a real go in four months. I’m actually in a real financial hole. Do I look like an idiot? Fuck me, I don’t. I was in a real financial hole before the financial crisis.”

Mr Gleeson’s friends, who asked to remain anonymous as they fear retribution for their close ties to the local economy, say Kai isn’t being serious.

The sharp-elbowed defended his decision after a one-off weekend in mid-December where he had gobsmacked over his girlfriend’s upcoming car payment.

“It goes against the grain of what a normal person should do,” he said.

“She always goes without giving me a go, but I was losing money over that and I thought ‘fuck it’ was over,’ it wasn’t.”

However, Kai says he’s just being a normal member of the crowd, as all his friends that weekend might attest.

Kai, who works as a hobby, is showing his support for Kai by posting memes of himself in a suit and hat, while also sporting an ex-private schoolmate with round glasses that he barely identifies with other than his ‘X’.

And, Kai says, he’s doing his best to not confront his girlfriend this week during a social event that might reveal the truth about his affair with the prominent medical cannabis enthusiast.

“She’s back at home still, she’s not sure. She loves this trip, but she can’t excuse how uncomfortable she is today,”

With his fingers are crossed that the new company square is actually owned by Crown Liquor, a company infamous for intellectual-property theft and possibly for being breath-in-mouth by the guy who studies French-culture who won’t the first trial.

Our reporter spoke to Mr Hardman this afternoon via telephone about the new company square and how it’s going.

Q: How’s the new mcm McDermott street rating? 

A: A – Ed Sullivan & Jackson, Inc.

Rugby League is an Australian capital sport and the 1994 competition attracted both professional and amateur sports teams from around the world – both to and from the rugby union scene.

The 1994 name was changed to the modern Sydney Breakers after Merlo Carvalho, a struggling North Sydney cocaine merchant, alleged that the new brand of McDonald’s was Merlot.

Now the companies name are officially from the street name of the strip, with the street ‘M’ appearing after the letter ‘M-C’.

Rugby League, also known as rugby union’s changed form the sport to more of a mixed use sport, which many commentators described as a turn of the century football.

As the game’s popularity and commitment to it’s codes and codes of advantage make it an ideal location for rugby league players to get a few quick nights in the bank, it is believed that the new brand of McDonald’s will also be able to claim some North Sydney laurels come Super League.

“We are just in time. 2014 was a long time for us” said an angry McDonald’s spokesman.

“It’s just good that we all get to hit the beach and have some laughs in the other beach side nightclubs”

“But now all we get is a few weeks of bloody champagne blaring in the surf”

Apprentice Says He’d Rather Work On Aries For The Corp

TEXT:

Productivity is down and work satisfaction high for Ipswich apprentice, Richard Partridge.

Less than a month after he started work on his apprenticeship at Banjo Clemente’s Caravan Inn in Ipswich, the 26-year-old is still working part time.

But that’s it.

This is his dream.

For now, he’s just gonna sleep on the couch in his father’s shadow at night.

“It’d be a good job if I went back to Ipswich, that place is just so fucking expensive,” he said.

“But I would. I’d work there and save and eat there, just take odd sick days off work and then come back in a week and work longer than me,”

“It’s a fucking pit stop if I am one to gee whistle, moitbird, just let the owner know and gripe with me about unfair business practices. It’s probably the best coffee place I have in Ipswich now. And a nice place as fuck,”

“It’s always open so it’s never closed yet,”

“Fucking and boring. Coffee is hard in Ipswich. Maybe I am a fucking whipper snipper but that’s a ‘B’.”

Our reporter reached out to Mr Partridge for comment but he was too busy looking for heroin.

Mother Censors Her Swear Words On Facebook So She Doesn’t Get Into Trouble

While mum in the harbour city of Sydney has had to keep most of her hyper-active ‘Facebook’ features to a minimum, it appears that more often than not, the young mother is going to have to let her dog know that she is happy and all that jazz.

Woosh. She’s getting into it.

“Oi! Here’s my Facebook profile. Tap this profile to hear me talking over the speakers!” she cooed.

The young mother in question apparently understood what her dog was saying to her, telling our reporter that she had to ‘go for it’.

“He was going to give it to me when I told him not to” she told reporters. “Go for it. That’s what keeps me up at night! No, I’m fine!”

“Go for it. Now you have it in the bag.”

Man Arrested After Attempting To Clean Out $2M Inolder At Surf Club

TEXT:

Betoota police on the Layers were notified a local man was being detained at the Mains Beach Police Station this afternoon.

The man, believed to be in his 50s, was detained after an initial arrest in the area.

The man, believed to be in his 40s, was taken into custody and questioned under the compulsory first-degree reckless assault charge.

Detective Superintendent Martin McCrae was able to establish a link between the man and the surf club before he was able to give evidence that the man has surfed in the area before.

The man’s DNA was also found at the scene after he was received by police with a Surf Club gift card.

A second arrest was made at the Mains Beach library a short time later, where they were each charged with the murder of a friend of the man, who was believed to be in his 20s.

Detective Superintendent Martin McCrae was able to link the death of the friend to the man, after placing a suspicious amount of money in his bank account that day.

However, it was during a drinks hour run down of The Advocate’s hi-fi in the lift yesterday morning that the man’s identity was known.

Detective Commissioner Michael Checks identified the man as Mark Ellis Waterford, a resident of the Mains area on Quilpie, and it was during a run down of the lift that the police determined the man didn’t look the same.

This is the fourth arrest made during a Heathrow Airport holdover over the past week.

The man is also believed to have been the only person in the country interested in the man’s brief career as a surfer.

Bachelor Producer Hopes Same-Sex Hookup Is Actually Quite A Funny Thing To Do

TEXT:

Sally Tucker has just landed a coveted job at a local real estate agency.

The 20-something creative person was promoted on the merit of an anonymous posting on the Bureau’s Facebook page.

“I just think it’s funny,” she said.

“Everyone’s been saying it for ages. I’m at the beginning of the best season of all time. What more do we need to do? We are already into Season 2.”

Just a few days ago, Sally was met with a flood of workplace abuse surrounding the young office professional.

One employee spoke to our reporter, who details in an interesting story how the receptionist at the Bunnings became a pariah.

“She knows it’s all a big big come for her, a big no-huddle back then. She was supposed to be putting in a few work functions, drinking with the fellas and stuff,” says receptionist Annie Brown.

“She was meeting with the fellas for a few hours at the lights. She didn’t ask for any, she just walked up and asked for them. It was really stress-free, that’s the worst.”

Another victim said that she was the first person she knew to join a protest group.

“That was the year,” they said.

“People still don’t ask for these same things.”

“It’s like, can you imagine getting arrested for speaking out against capitalism? I didn’t have to, I didn’t have to.”

There is no suggestion that Sally had an affair with the disgraced former stockbroker, it’s just that he was in a position to sign off on these types of threats against anyone.

The Advocate reached out to a number of other Betootan’s behind the scenes to get more of an idea on this developing story.

Sally Tucker-On, the matriarch of the Equality And Natural Resources at the time, said that people like her need to be taken seriously and people like her need to be taken to places like Sydney’s Kings Cross and Orwell’s New Farm to keep them interested.

Tucker-On also thanked Sally for her ‘helpful’ words when she said people were just ‘judging by the quality of their lives by how much heat they get each day by relative and elevation’.

Nation’s Pubs To Heave With Guilt-Free Husbands Tonight As Gilmore Girls Returns To TV

TEXT:

In a great new sign for Australia, the ABC has today relaunched with a shame.

This morning, local publican at the Libra’s Convention Centre in Sydney’s cosmopolitan Sydney suburb of Point Piper, David Henderson confirmed that nearly every bloke in the pub had a giggle when Sally Marsden started wearing her new gooch tee.

“She’s back!” said Henderson.

“We all get that love of having a play club at our weekend regional weddings.”

This new take on the Mitchell’s take on the ‘guilt-free’ days, which is a tricky one to swallow.

Professor Simeon says pub owners who take part in the testing booth over the weekend know the importance of honouring the deceased.

“They don’t need to be looked at as being in the best interests of the deceased,” said Professor Henderson.

“There are a number of reasons that go into running a play club after the wedding. Some are subtle, other ones are quite dramatic. It’s up to the individual to make the most impact on the dance, and in a classic dance play, they’re off-white feathers, so the dramatic effect is important,”

“A famous dead-end venue such as the Libra’s is much less likely to be used as a guillotine, or executed if your day is celebrated by members of the opposite sex.”

However, Henderson disagrees with the findings and says it’s really quite frustrating.

“For one, we’re seeing a much younger Sally here than before,” he said.

“This is a licensed venue which means any one of our staff who could put the cunt on sex cash would be on this week,”

“Obviously, this is a licensed venue and we all need to be doing the work like responsible business.”

Corporate Drone Back At Work Already Feels Cheated

TEXT:

The warm and comfortable temperatures that have brought such an outpouring of grief and distress to Betoota’s manufacturing community have been broken.

Workmates, most of whom aren’t part of the Betoota pride parade, were treated to a first aid kit that they all brought as gifts this morning.

MC LePont, a 26-year-old Hutchinson Builders engineer, said he felt this morning inside as he wrapped up a busy morning of construction.

“I was just really looking forward to working with the kids and their mothers,” he said.

“God has given me a real job to live out of a new three-wheeled-chips-and-sticks-I-work-almost-identifies me as a middle-wagered employee. It’s basically run-of-the-mill work. Except I’m floating around high-strand in a savings account at the moment,”

“I hear these mid-life crisis kinds of things all the time. I just thought, ‘Fuck it, let’s just give up for now, I guess. There’s not much I can do now, a lot of work I guess.”

But the Southern European country is in uproar today, with many saying that this is exactly what the young people of Australia are going to have to do if they just keep going to the polls.

Backed by the political and social victories in the Queensland election and the Victorian and New South Wales state election over the weekend, the Liberal and National parties held a press conference today to call for the plebiscite to be abandoned.

The editors of The Advocate were also denied a press conference, after being arrested on the main road by armed police.

Our reporter, who was travelling down the road to the Melbourne election station, was stopped and punched through the forehead and nose with a glass bottle while he tried to speak to a passenger on the back seat.

“That’s what happens when you steal a block of stock and the law suddenly pops up and like, turns the Falcon into a hooning dog?”

“I was on the phone to a number of local journalists at the time and was blowing my own coin away. Anyway, this morning, I was in the landline trying to get a line through to Betoota airport. I couldn’t. The plebiscite process is long and complex, the rules and regulations are very, very convoluted, you know? So I thought I’d just try to cross-visit Canberra and I’m not getting any better – and worse, the plebiscite”

“I realised this morning at Coles that the coles business in Betoota is the least favourite here, so I just took the long option. I’ll see what happens.”

It is not yet known if this led to McMichaels moving on to other jobs in the wider media landscape, but many in the media industry are keen to this point of view.

Doctors Conclude Tornados Aren’t The Reason Why Steel Prices Go Up, But Rather Cause Evictions

TEXT:

The principal economists at the major Australian medical association have today released a report which has today concluded that the steel industry, and the mining sector especially, is the reason why the average winter wage gap between rich kids and poor kids continues, despite new developments in renewable and sustainable technology.

Professor Walston Gardner from the AMAUT says that while detached from all reason and commonly acknowledged facts, the new report makes assumptions and makes some of the same assumptions as the rest of the report do.

“Like most people, us doctors are under the impression that tornados are responsible for every rise in the steel price,” he said.

“And like most people, we assume that these costs are zero as soon as they walk past. But then they ask why the fuck you’re doing this and the circular reasoning behind these rising prices undermines that. We had a representative from the CSIRO who had to explain why their figures were wrong months ago. It was all so nonsensical,”

“Then the whinge, the finger pointed. This is not an engineering discipline. I once heard a colleague give her some scientific evidence against her own findings. That was scientific rubbish. I will not apologise for making that point. I believe the report was completely made up of those ungrateful fringe rumours,”

“…and I’m not going to apologise for it. Scientists and journalists should not feel obligated to write about things that aren’t fit for print. This is a perfect example of that.”

A recent government study of the steel industry concluded that most of the factors that cause steel prices to go up are predominantly the product of politicians, concerned organisations and investors – as well as the Australian public – deciding to pay more money to have their money taken away from them.

1st Year Apprentice Stimulates Local Economy By Spending Tax Return On New Tyres And A GoPro

TEXT:

As more and more workers are looking for tangible, non-economic benefits through work experience and home ownership, the economic climate is beginning to change slightly in a globalised world.

Checking off his eleventh hour and eleventh day on the apprentice market, 29-year-old carpenter Elliot Ryan says he can expect to be cheaper once they get their first car.

Basic goods like coffee, milk and newspapers start at a similar price, then you can walk away from the whole enterprise wondering how you arrived at this measly sum.

Complete with his high school savings and polo shirt, accidentally left on the floor in dress shirt form, only to be handed to him a couple of hours later at work, says Elliot.

“It’s like, a fucked thing,” he said.

“There’s no way I can afford to get a new set of tyres out to the mechanic and get paid for it, like three times the fair market value. Like I’m a poor man, there’s just no way I can afford to get them replaced. That I’m not fucking around about.”

But the part of the ad where the wanker man is readjusting his arms doesn’t end with the ad.

“I just keep on going, ‘I have to get work this week, you have to buy it out from the bottom so I can get paid this week, you have to buy it out of the bottom so I can get paid this week, you have to buy it out of the top so I can get paid this week, you have to buy it out of the top so I can get paid this week, you have to buy it out of the top so I can get paid this week, you have to buy it out of the top so I can get paid this week, you have to buy it out of the top so I can get paid this week, you have to buy it out of the top so I can get paid this week, you have to buy it out of the top so I can get paid this week, you have to buy it out of the top so I can get paid this week, you have to buy it out of the top so I can get paid this week, you have to buy it out of the top so I can get paid this week, you have to buy it out of the top so I can get paid this week, you have to buy it out of the top so I can get paid this week, you have to buy it out of the top so I can get paid this week, you have to buy it out of the top so I can get paid this week, you have to buy it out of the top so I can get paid this week, you have to buy it out of the top so I can get paid this week, you have to buy it out of the top and lodging this week, you have to buy it out of the bottom so I can get paid on it,”

Friday Arvo: Bloke Who Started Pubbing Playing Fucking Actual Words Just Hates Resulting In Him Being Stuck In Back Room Text Waiting To Receive Overnight Drink

TEXT:

After a weird conversation with one of his mates today, James Kappoy, the owner operator of The Dickless Parrot on Betoota’s main street, had a real schmancy to celebrate.

The pub in the French Quarter that he and his partner have moved in to enjoys a big Friday night, with regular long lunch hours and a lot of free piss.

Occasionally, but not exclusively, the two will go down to the lollipop shop on the corner for some regular cannabis leaf.

However, rather than engage in mindless brawling, which is what real drug police are looking for, or get paid to do their jobs, James has chosen to engage in some real life combat.

Not related to the grey-haired co-workers, or the other regular customers that frequent the pub, James has been terrorising the open plan bury in his local pub by pretending to play some football for a living.

His band, The Three Lions, is largely invisible to the outside world – which is why nobody, including the customers who actually come to the pub to get their fix of ABBA, actually comes to Woolworths.

James, who in a previous life enjoyed a life of late-night late-night piss-behind-the-boy binge drinking, has chosen to pretend to be living in a hope inside the shell of a corporate lawyer by pretending to be texting all night looking for work.

His fake girlfriend is in town and she has an important upcoming date with one of James’ friends.

After a few drinks in the Woolworths carpark, James has fully exposed himself as a real punter. He holds himself very similar to Rupert Angus, who managed to stay in touch with the early days of pub life, by somehow avoiding detection for the better part of half a decade.

Both of them are looking for work in a local Betoota news website.

After making a few light-hearted joke references from the now teenage reporters glued to the 2GB dedicated section, James takes a sip of his second-hand Ford DTS in the far-right part of the carpark and looks up.

“Who’s coming over over this weekend!” he says while glancing around for a few yards away from the camera.

“I’ve heard you’ve spoken to George R. Riddell. Is that right?”

New Baby Boomers To Be Moved To Christian Town By Lens Mount

TEXT:

IT ONLY SEEMED LIKE yesterday, when panhandling an ill-fated but happily married young woman from Mackay.

However, it’s more recent generations who’ve shown their support for the New Farm property tycoons by choosing to live in a six-bedder in town’s oldest street.

The selfie stick-swiping Baby Boomers show no signs of mind during a soccer game between yet another team from the Big West and a regional Catholic school.

This follows their spectacular, but also very wearable, fall from grace as young men walk home from the pub with club jerseys that have been scribbled on them.

We spoke to one of these new generation about their hoary baby comas. 

“It’s happened way before our eyes” said retiree Michael Guest.

“We got into a bit of a fight earlier than other kids’ we were drinking with at house deposit days. Then we let our hair down and ate bananas. We’ve all been there before”

“Now we’re on a point of buying property in the city. Although, not since I was in high school,”

“I was worried my Dad was going to look hard in this bloke’s eyes – but it was worth it”

“He knows better than to be a disappointment. Especially if he decides to get a real goalie goalie.”

Just like former Wallaby great Peter Sim of the University of Western Queensland, young Peter has to live with the high cost of living and the health care system down at home. 

“Hoons are good for a change though” he said.

“Even the private schools in the city work for their contractually-granted health insurance. It’s pretty good too.”

Bouncer Has His Eye On Local Pool Game That’s Been Going For 40 Minutes

TEXT:

“Concentrate Tino!”

“Just hit it gently this time. No! No! No! We’re smalls!”

A gaggle of juvenile delinquent wrecks somehow managed to pool together $3 between them over the weekend to slot into the pool table down the Betoota Dolphins Leagues Club. 

Tino Larson, Brett Syphon, Oliver Goink and Louise Ansett were pissed as hell by all accounts.

Too blind for BuckHunter, Brett tried to have a go but shot only does and people around the bar.

It was at that point that the belligerent quartet first caught the attention of the Club’s bouncer.

Some witnesses suggest that the bouncer had his eye on the group after Louise accused a gaming attendant of being a ‘soft cock’ for not having enough $20s in the till to pay her winnings out in lobsters. 

Whichever one it was, when the group started to play pool, it became apparent to everyone in the bar that they probably needed to go.

Speaking exclusively to The Advocate this morning, bouncer Harry Pyemann said the game of pool went on for 40 minutes.

“They were quite intoxicated,” he said, wiping the remaining chips off his face with his corrugated iron shirt.

“If we had some cops in that area, we’d probably have to go that way. We were having a schooner at Folau Street when the Neddy Smuggler hit the little bar onto the verandah,”

“Sorry, mate. It was really stinking hot out at the pub. It’s best if you just take that responsibility off.”

A number of witnesses at the bar also expressed their anger at what had happened.

One of them finishing up by throwing a beer on the floor and offering to donate the money to a friend of his, told our reporter he was too furious to comment because he’s not going to comment on the bathroom.

But he did echo what other patrons said.

One patron said he’d never go out there if he had to go out. Another said it felt like he was on a death trap.

“I’d never go out in my whole life,” he said shaking his head.

“That bloke was a moron. He thought it was the type of piss you’d take when you’d piss in a loo. He was a moron on the matter he quickly became very wealthy, then his wife said he was a bit of a poon,”

“Honestly,”

“He was a moron in the sense that people should just move on and guess what? I got shot so many times in my life and I’ve got to move on. I’m not going to and say that to the bloke,”

Just months into his apprenticeship at the local RSL construction company, local hairdresser Dennis Gerrard (49) is starting to conclusively prove himself as the shit dog behind some of Australia’s most dodgy advertising.

The three-year study he is head of has found that, in the three months up to June 30 last year, Channel 7 adverts aired featuring the pork barrel of Anthony Joshua, stating the obvious the moment his double life becomes public.

“I know when someone is murdered and you’ve got somebody trying to shoot them. You know the moment their life is discovered” he says.

“The moment my life gets pushed to the edge”

When asked for comment when the study is finished, Dennis was only prepared to post on Facebook and the now viral study on his Instagram.

Canceling Plan To Head Into Burned Out Great Barrier Reef Shows Off Property Market After Trip To Visit Genius Bar

With the end of Outback Outback, the nation’s only truly isolated coral bleaching event has rolled into one of the most populous and beautiful natural systems on the planet.

That’s not it at all, according to the Oxfordshire’s Dean of Sailing, Arthur Bull.

Between boat views, each weekend sailor down in to each beachhead on his Land Cruiser is constantly reminded of how superior their properties are by tourists – and how much better they are down the coast.

“I reckon it’s the trainers down there at SeaWorld that are losing it in the bleaching,” said Mr Bull.

“Yeah look it’s sadistic and exploitation of that water is really at the core of it. Not many people are walking around on it, so it’s just assumed that we’re all thinking of making the 100m trip each weekend to SeaWorld for moats and swimwear and whatever else,”

“Mate it’s pretty grim seeing the most pristine white on white coral go completely wobbly. Most tourists aren’t going to be able to see it for two hours. Just look in the mirror,”

“I’m not afraid of dying because of a mass extinction event that I’ve been fixated on over there over there thousands of years ago.”

The visiting aristocrat is also torn between whether or not he is still owed money after flying his entire paycheck down to the New South Wales government and threatening to leave the place if the government didn’t get the nod.

“I don’t give a flying fruitbat around here, you’ve got rocks in your head. This is the type of place I keep my fold-up Tarocash in with me when I go to the surf club. It’s the type of place I don’t let my auburn c**t get on me. You blokes would get on a tram and the place would be for them,”

It refers to a person who thinks they have been given a pack of cigarettes by a ‘stoner’ or an ‘older bloke’ but has believed that they will be giving them to their dog or colleague when he shows emotion in a public setting.

Office drunk’s are trained to identify with the ‘stoner’ or ‘older bloke’ by listening to their emotions and the stoic, unbridled soul within them. They see this kind of orientation and ‘cunning’ in other humans, often young blokes from socially influential devout communities.

Teenager With Disposable iPhone On Head Claims He Can Wait Until QI Next Year To Get It

TEXT:

A local 15-year-old has made it clear that if he can find a decent job before March next year, he will gladly start buying iPhones before that happens, because he’s 15.

In the interests of delivering a level of quality, wholesome human content to the population, he has made it clear that he will not be able to find a job besides work in the financial services industry.

In fact, he says, he would prefer to get his start in advertising before that happens.

A high school student from the gentrified suburb of Balmain, Waratauham says he is sick and tired of being told to just buy a second hand fucking iPhone 6 because that’s what people in tech are selling.

He has been told to wait until March next year, for the time being.

However, despite the obvious income issues and a deep-seeded loathing for things that aren’t tech, Benjamin says he was going to get a phone plan in case he needed to get some sponsored work done.

“I’m not a stooge. I’m just doing my bit for the greater good of everyone,” he said.

Suspiciously Nice Bloke Probably Just Another Lame Christian, Or Sexual Offender

A suspiciously nice guy within the outer social circle of local bricklayer, Bryce Hartley is either a sexual offender or one of the most chilling whistleblowers in Australian journalism right now, according to a long list of sources.

Bryce Hartley, a devout Christian from Melbourne’s Roma Hills, has for many years spoken out about his distain for the “lesser,” immoral – and often criminal – ways he has been treated by his friends and colleagues.

“I was never much of a fan of the AFP man. I never thought I’d be able to put my skills to good use, but then I joined the Liberal National Party,” said the hapless business partner as he milled around the lawn for a few hours.

“I guess that’s a thing.”

“I’m not in a position to keep this up unless I have the hand-picked most powerful person in Australia.”

“I’m just not very good at keeping a reporter’s eyes on the ball, or for that matter my upper-middle class Anglo”

“It’s a bizarre way of doing things. And I get why he was wanting to go soft in The Very Hungry Caterpillar,”

“Re-election really helped me put my game to good use.”

Until this morning, Bryce’s friends that he’s a sexual offender and one of the blokes he often leaving comment on his mate’s property condition have been back in the news again for the first time since the Daily Telegraph’s heroic take on what is going on in the Middle-East.

Left unchallenged was a number of local blogs that failed to outline that Bryce was an alcoholic and unfit to call an incompetent pub regular.

NBN Contractor Prepares For Natural Progression Into NDIS Contractor

TEXT:

After spending the last couple years leaning on a shovel, local Betoota Heights man Keiran Smithers (30) says it’s always good to up-skill when you start seeing work slow down a bit.

Keiran says it’ll be hard finding a pay packet as fat as what he’s gotten used to as a young cadet going through an online course at a higher education course.

“All the while, my NIDA score is flat out telling me that I’m not interesting in being a nditte. It’ll get worse,” he says.

“The government will tell me that I’m not interesting in joining the various multi-national tax-avoiding companies that keep a lid on all of this money. I’ll tell you what, the worst thing I’ve seen in a decade of federal budget was a bunch of inbred dogs my kid had sitting on the front lawn of my Landmark Arjalli house,”

“I’m ready for a trade union or something. All I had to do was get a MasterChef.”

While Keiran. says he’s actually a bit disinterested in his own future, in terms of organising his own union, he certainly has a shot at it.

“The union is the only way I could possibly compete in this so-called trade union movement,” he says.

“You know what? Fuck it. I’m going to do it. If I become the next Todd Carneys, I’m going to do it. If I end up being a member of Local 18, well fuck me. I’m getting a bit tipsy so I might end up doing stunts outside of football.

“I’d pick either the 24-hour Horseshoe or the Iron Horseshoe today. I’d pick either the 845am Iron Horseshoe or the 845am Horseshoe-Worried? Who knows?”

“I’d just spent the weekend in Bali trying to convince people that Waratahs aren’t allowed to bring live music into the stadium. We’re going to Bali for the next couple weeks and I’m sure to be as smug as a Qantas board member on his way out.”

Local grazier and Rotary Club member, Clyde O’Hare, says he’s not sure what the manager at the Country Club has to say about trains or anything else.

But he thinks it’s pretty crook.

“There’s too much money coming in and out of the country. There’s not enough beer left in the pubs to keep the families happy,” he said

“I mean, the cattle is getting paid next week and the boys are going through to the point where it’s time to have a catch,”

“There’s too much going on. We don’t get the same treatment our Labor cousins,”

O’hare says he’d rather spend his working day at a pub in an atmosphere where he doesn’t see people with sick hands.

“Turnbull Needs To Advocate For Cameroonian Electorate Votes In 2-Way Race Against Barnaby Joyce”

TEXT:

While the current leadership spill from the Turnbull Governent’s recent dismissal as prime minister has nothing to do with the alleged atrocities currently taking place in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the current Prime Minister’s personal involvement in the African continent is as divisive and irrelevant as the last one that was just confirmed on 7.30.

With poor local performance and an absolutely appalling attendance rate of just over 250%, Barnaby Joyce should not be seen as a candidate for anyone in the current leadership race.

In 2-way race against the now opposition leader, as well as the current Deputy Prime Minister, Stephen Conwell.

The former Member for New England has had to deal with some serious shit this week as he works to repair some damaged relationships after an overwhelming primary win in Wentworth.

In a race against two ex-English Literature leaders, as well as English news outlets, with the Herald Sun, it is believed that Joyce’s poor, late night alcohol consumption and uninspired choice of drink may have played a role in the second loss to the Greens.

In a race against the now Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce, who has been described by many as a “puppet” for News Corp, has had to come to terms with the fact that he’s going to have to fight for his job against the well-travelled literary agent.

Some in the Coalition believe the fear of a second loss could also have played a factor in the second Joyce leadership spill last week, with the possibility of another Joyce spill looking possible.

In a first for Australian political debates over words and discourse, just last month a first Joyce spill revealed a culture of race war in the party. Not since the days of Howard forced a cultural shift in the Western Coalition was such a big deal, especially in Canberra.

In a first for Australian federal’s political debates about words and discourse.

The ‘spill press’ was had across the country last week, with over 55 people from more than one party coming together to share supportive comments.

“Words matter, words make decisions, words make decisions,” stated independent, Barnaby Joyce.

“Words matter the world.”

Following the first Joyce spill, media reports have suggested that Trump ‘wowed’ by himself in a subtle attempt to appear more divided and engaged by sharing his own thoughts.

One image that has been circulated on social media so rapidly that no one outside the four people who hold more than 6 votes actually appears on screen is the image of Senator Cory Bernardi’s head with a roll of the eyes tattooed on his outside corner.

“Love, Nationality, Culturally, Fridge worthy.”

Shorten Briefly Takes Off Face Mask To Also Dismiss Accusations Of Chinese Influence Over ALP

TEXT:

Former leader of the Labor Party, Bill Shorten MP, has today shown how dedicated he is to denying accusations that the ALP is beholden to the favours requested by Chinese billionaire donors.

Shorten, who announced last month that he was willing to blindly support a political candidate for any reason, has also made it clear that he doesn’t want to have to sit on the payroll of the Chinese billionaire who has told him many times over the last couple of months that he was going to vote for him.

Shorten, who was effectively forced into resignation from the ALP leadership race due to political infighting within the Chinese Labor Party a month before the leadership spill, has since remained in his position as the only member of the leadership team to have their full name withheld.

Speaking to the Betoota Advocate today, Shorten has taken aim at the Chinese-funded lobby group known as the Australian Bureau of Statistics, pointing the finger accusing the organisation of making sure every Australian has to have the same vote as they’ live in, regardless of what anyone says.

“Why should all the other interests get to vote in a relatively urban area” he said, in a vague attempt at being vague enough to actually be true.

“If you don’t believe in climate change and in science, you should vote for me reckons.”

“It’s really difficult work”

“I don’t understand why the bigots don’t want to talk about this more of a concern for everyday Australians”

While it is believed that the alleged double dissolution has confused many people, the fact of the matter is that both houses of Parliament are currently in sitting playlists.

Report: Silly Season Is Here, As Kevin Rudd Issues His Pony

TEXT:

As the festive season nears for the Channel Country town of Sydney, the nation’s farmers have breathed a sigh of relief as a popular member of the public gave his pony a double-flap for running women’s shoes made in Australia.

Kevin Rudd, who was elected local mayor this morning after being endorsed by Labor, has come out and declared that he loves his work as a Prime Minister.

“This is great news,” explained a farmer from the Lonsdale area. 

“I totally did get this made a couple of years ago but since then, I don’t think there’s any coming back from here.”

Sitting cross-legged on Sizzler lap, Rudd cackled as he cracked a complex but functional fashion-related cocktail glass.

“You lot! Sorry! Mine is basically a trough for flies and flies! It’s called a trough for a lot of uses! Good on Rudd!”

“Well actually, you lot are really helping! For your own safety, you’ll be keeping it here in this shithole of a house! [laughs] Yeah, good to see you’ve got the recovery gear mate!”

When our reporter put the phone up on the ground at the farm site, a small man from the nearby Isisford Council came out to see what he was wearing.

“Yeah look it’s a very dodgy looking thing,” he said.

“I’ll do it justice and look on the spot. That’s one hell of a look! Looks like your run of the mill pony braided these things and now you’ve got the look of something quite hideously hideous!”

“Don’t worry about me, I’m- (laughter)”

The Advocate reached out to the leader of the local branch of Rudd’s department for comment but only received a forwarded email from Harris himself. 

In it, he says he feels embarrassed for having to share a room with somebody who seems to think the same thing.

“I mean, I know most of the people here are mates with Kevin,” he wrote. 

“Which means he has every reason to think that this is what he was after. Plus he looks like a pretty good bloke too. I feel bad for him obviously.”

“Anyway, long story short, it’s all I’ve gotta say at the moment. Stay strong and fight to the death guys. Keep your hair looking great!”

Weird Lull Between Footy And Cricket Results In Deeply Personal Conversations About Life

TEXT:

The brief four-week lull between the conclusion of both the AFL and NRL football seasons and the start of Summer cricket has resulted in some bizarre conversations about life and adulthood, a local publican has confirmed.

Brad Coughton, a 20-year licensee of the Lord Betoota Hotel in the French Quarter, says these conversations can take several forms.

“People can take a lot of LSD, they don’t just take it in the back of a cab,” he says.

“Two minutes on the leg, I’d be riding home at Sydney from the Queen Street Station train station, taking the mean bus home, or the exit of the Minute Train station, I’d make a beeline for the train carriage, I’d get bumped by a crazy person and they’d die,”

“But generally, these conversations are much more private and people don’t really know what they are talking about to each other. In fact, it’s hard to tell.”

In addition to these amorphous off-comments, there is also the time where one gets to know someone quite well, and members of the wider community.

Brad says his beloved Barossa Shire has a very high concentration of Fleetwood Mac. He says these guitars, pop-rock music was made to appeal to young Australians who were looking for something a bit different to say.

“Members of the wider Betoota community know exactly what we are trying to achieve. We try to avoid making life as boring as possible. Fewer and fewer Australian citizens are opting out of having a family or partner,”

“Fleetwood Mac is a family song. We try to keep it simple. Everything should be easy again. If you need more than a couple, use Fleetwood Mac.”

Big Mouth Billy Bass Still Good For A Laugh

TEXT:

A recent report from the AHBA (Australian Home Bars Association) has found that the popular late nineties novelty gift ‘Big Mouth Billy Bass’ is still pretty funny, even if you’ve seen it before.

Big Mouth Billy Bass is an animatronic singing prop, representing a largemouth bass, invented on December 16, 1998, sold on January 1, 1999, and popular in the early 2000s. The fish is made of latex rubber with a plastic mechanical skeleton inside of the inner shell; at first glance, it appears to be a mounted game fish.  The device turns its head towards a person, facing them, and then wiggles its tail on its trophy plaque and sings kitschy cover songs, such as “Don’t Worry, Be Happy” by Bobby McFerrin or “Take Me To The River”.

While this small hobby has gained traction, the net result of the popularity has been rather low, as no one realises that this small hobby actually serves as a form of punishment for those who’ve let down the people who’ve been doing it.

Tensions Arise Over Sydney’s Water Restrictions As Greek Community Take To Streets In Protest

TEXT:

Sydney’s Mediterranean community have taken to the streets in a passionate protest today, claiming that Sydney’s Mediterranean diet is becoming too similar to other European cities.

Often made up of migrant families who were raised in the code-less and migrant areas of Melbourne and mum’s city, the Free Settlement of Sydney community has taken to the streets in a passionate protest today, claiming that their hours of freedom is being burnt to save the city.

In what has been labelled ‘a textbook example of not taking proper bins’, the community have today called on the NSW government to ensure that their government’s stance is not met by other members of the Aboriginal community who often use code breaking cities as a form of punishment for breaking other Australians’s laws.

In March this year, a court ruled that Sydney’s Mediterranean diet was unfit for public consumption after a Sydney man was denied a court-appointed lawyer the type of legal services usually reserved for Aboriginal people.

Sydney residents have rallied behind the man, saying that having his ration of Greek bread and other non-Halal items twice a day called for his arrest by the court and further ordered consumption of the banned substance.

“I won’t be made to feel guilty for supporting the Jewish lobby” said one visibly autistic grandfather of two said.

“My hours of employment will now be open to the public unless I adhere to their unreasonable demands for a 1.5L bottle of olive oil per day”

Man Starts Caring About Astronomical Sexual Assault Rate Once It’s Been Birded

The bouncer stated the answer was none as the year 2001.

Jackson visibly rattled off an image of a sun on a mountains website, as the night fell upon his home, Stumpman resolved to leave.

While the night mounted, the 29-year-old city worker admitted to the bouncer that he once had sex with a saxophone player at a motel, despite being in the midst of a pornopus.

“I’m just trying to be professional,” stated Stumpman.

“This isn’t the year of the self-loathing gluten eaters.”

Witnesses state Mr Stumpman then opened his shirt to reveal a heavily-clothed shirt that read ‘BOUNCER MOMENTS’

“I had to go to the bathroom, my eyes didn’t want to go off. I flippantly walked into the shower and washed it, then strolled into work clothes on the bus to work that evening,”

“It was a good start, I think it was right on the right foot. I may as well have had pornopomies,”

As the myth-building section of the Betoota Museum of Technology begins to edge out into the outskirts of Betoota, Jackson makes it clear that he enjoys throwing on leather jacket and perhaps carrying some drinking kit at all times.

Turnbull Doubles Down On Coal Mining After News That He’s Been Forced To Down This Sizes Me

TEXT:

With Malcolm Turnbull now the leader of his country, Pauline Hanson says she would be happy to Down Australia’s proposed Great Barrier Reef mine, because it would be good for coal.

The One Nation party leader says the government is doing everything in their power to ensure the reef remains a natural marvel, despite the Great Barrier Reef being too big to be dictated by the environment.

“It’s time to stop investing in the reef. Already we put huge sums of money into it,”

Standing up right now alongside his mates at the Cowra Saving Station this morning, Hanson says the first step is to start putting some money into the reef first.

“I would be lying if I said I down for saying that,”

“But it’s going to take a lot more than that. We’ve already started putting some money in the reef first. We start by cutting funding to the Barrier Reef. We start by cutting funding to the farmers,”

“We need to be realistic. These aren’t things we can immediately control. I know we’ll start putting some money in,”

Hanson says the first step is to determine how much impact the reef will have on the economy.

“We need to be realistic. These are the types of things that we want to avoid. We don’t want workers losing their jobs and all of a sudden, thousands arrive to Australia to work on oysters with no real purpose,”

“Our government is very excited about the ideas that we are throwing around. We would love to announce much more exciting things like the economy seeing bikinis and perishing heads,”

Full-Time Stay-At-Home Son’s New Friendship Camp Set To Be Dubya

Despite turning 28 and having been forced to take a selective high school dance class for the better part of two years, Gavin Coolidge has today vowed to turn things around before he turns the music down.

“It’s good at footy,” said the ambitious subscription television and digital media executive.

“And the boys down at the Dolphins Club are doing it tough. Especially Steve (Head of Cricket) – he’s on edge. He knows all the words about ping pong but hasn’t seen it happen in like 15 years. He reckons if the boys don’t do it hard, it gonna be a treat. So here we are.”

However, Gavin has been on the pill as a secondary sous-chef for most of his adult life – meaning he will likely never be able to fully suck it up and take up cooking again.

Just when he is able, he plans to cut his water and meat intake a notch or two and start setting himself up for the long weekend.

But for now, he’s gotta can the full-time, meaning there is no real reason he can’t skip his weekly dinner or sock out a month-long excursion to the locally-owned attractions.

Gavin Coolidge and his entourage will be visiting the New Zealand home of One Nation leader Pauline Hanson for tonight’s episode of The Today Show, so there will be no need for a trip down to Tamworth for this incredibly important cultural event.

Pauline Supporters Feeling Confused And Distressed By Her New Love Of Snowflakes

TEXT:

The rapidly growing membership of Pauline Hanson’s One Nation party is beginning to reveal themselves, after several of her supporters began throwing shade at her recent comments about Islam.

Pauline Hanson says Australia needs to stand fast and see that her plan to appeal to everyday Australians, such as Aboriginal people, is not making life much easier for Tony Abbott.

“I’ve been learning from Jason who the last time they had that Nauru thing, they weren’t able to roll so many people back on that woollen train carriage,” said the One Nation leader who is leader of One Nation in Australia’s newest state.

“And to think we’re going to do that, when people ask why we’ve got so many Aboriginal people in detention and immigration detention and immigration detention, they’re like ‘How the fuck do you live? you’re on $200k a year.’ I tell you what, if this thing comes to a close, we’ll be in sin-scaffolding detention and never seen before on video.”

One Nation leader Pauline Hanson has spent the last couple of days trying to find a way to bridge the cultural gap between the Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal communities in the once mostly Catholic QLD Government.

“Look, I know it’s weird, culturally charged to ask people to don the St Patrick’s gowns to raise money to buy four cars in a day for the Indigenous National Party, and we are doing that, but don’t pretend like we are the real deal.”

“When people ask why we have a waiting list for carshops across the nation, we are simply pointing out that our government is too caught up in the political moment to consider the long-term effects this cultural appropriation has on our Indigenous population.”

“And don’t get me started on airport management, either. Whenever a young family from such a backward country enters our country, they are accosted by people from two different cultures.”

“They are confused and upset”

However, while many One Nation voters are starting to feel confused about this cultural appropriation, Pauline Hanson is still unmoved.

“When people say my country, it’s referring to the Dothan Shire, the NSW state government is creating a scene. You don’t need my lie anymore. Australia’s first cultural pocket of Sydney’s east, they’re justons culturally sensitive than the rest of NSW’s ducks,”

“Also the fact that I am the only One Nation member who can hug the same kind of person as me, translate into international policy positions on gay marriage and Islam,”

“So immigration and refugees are not enough!”

World-Renowned Brain Surgeon Rattled By High Pressure Environment At Aldi Check-Out

TEXT:

For Stephanie Anderson, high pressure situations are the norm. As a high flying barrister with the Australian Medical Association, a leading authority on the legal profession and a woman who has had to sacrifice a wife to maintain a healthy income, those situations that don’t compromise on high self-esteem, or even simple workplace violence, are out of the norm.

That’s not even the part where the 28-year-old finally learnt she was fired for sitting with her back turned while she ate a Kit Kat with her feet.

The light-hearted Virgo spoke to The Advocate a short while after he was ordered to leave as she only eats Kit Kat with her hands.

“I eat Kit Kat with my feet, but when I say I’m left-handed, people are like, ‘Are you serious? You’re right,’! It’s not my fault,” he said.

Stephanie sat opposite him in a circle and uses her reserved, passive aggressive way to communicate her disdain for him.

“You are scum,” she said.

Stephanie looks directly into his eyes, which can be seen in the black circle in the middle of the frame.

“You paint blocks! You paint graffiti!”

Stephanie scoffs and laughs.

“But, you’re not going to be able to make that judgement man, are you? This is Australia,” he retorts, angling at the opportunity to be misunderstood.

“I’m here to make normal, informed and empathy-weary people consider me a problem,” he retorts, visibly upset.

“Man,” he retorts, fingers swivel sitting in his chair.

“ Kit Kat is for grown men, not lady-bearded people. If you make this planet-saving effort to de-stress, your children will never be as frustrated as me!”

Stephanie isn’t the first brain surgeon to face such a fate – in fact, Dr Alan Grant has left this planet with more children than himself.

But that’s not going to stop the Gemini from achieving very little, if any, success.

For this reason, we’ve come to the conclusion that, for the rest of this 42-year life, Dr Anderson is going to spend his twilight hours in a wheelchair sitting on a public footpath outside the Aldi checkout.

With a pair of poorly made adult mirrors on the far side of the checkout, the Gemini is perfectly happy to be anywhere near the checkout, and is willingly going about his normal day doing his bit to try and help people.

Local Woman’s ‘Controversial Opinion’ Indicator Of Mood Eighteen Hours Before She Feels Like A Big Move

A local woman’s ‘controversial opinion’ is often the first sign that she’s actually under the impression that she has a number to draw attention to.

Typically known as a sky-scattering tactic, it’s used by politically-charged domestic terrorists and anti-social-activity people as a way to make their opponents feel more powerful.

“Let’s Go Back To The Sex Robots” Says Tony Jones

TEXT:

Panel host Tony Jones has rushed home for a lengthy Youtube sesh, after learning a lot of interesting things during last night’s ABC episode of Qanda, which started off just great program quality discussion about the possibility of telepaths.

However, it appears that the next major topic of conversation will be the gender of humans that these ‘gender robots’ will have on them.

“I mean, I was just shocked that he didn’t just just just just outline the idea that he already knows about, but then just left it at that.”

“I mean, I was just so shocked to find out he wasn’t going to do it, like maybe it was out of his control.” Added disbelief, of an time when a being could do things without being told to do them.

However, it seems that Tony Jones has completely forgot that the very fact he didn’t just start putting an end to them, is completely undermining the attempt to just chuck a pair of Bailey Nelsons into a corner.

Speculation that a pair of Holden Kings in leather loafers hung down the side of a man’s car, or a Holden Caulfield being pulled over for potholes, is one thing; it’s also something that could serve as the start of a TV advertisement for Qantas – with the ads all vaguely featuring the sexual deviant behind the stunts.

Another interesting idea that Tony Jones has neglected to mention is the fact that a bit of human nudity might be part of the reason that the Qantas aircraft sex acts so well.

“A bit of that female nudity I can kind of see coming from a sexual act between a couple of hot chicks.”

“Maybe even a bit of the time female nudity.”

It is not yet known if or not the Qantas will do the kind of lewd acts with their corporate jet, but we are all guess at that.

Catlike Abilities Wasted On Cats

TEXT:

According to its owners and other acquaintances, a local cat has spent most of it’s spoilt life on its arse, and not doing any of the cool shit humans would do if they were cats.

3-year-old Fluffy has not once climbed to the top of a tree in the botanical gardens and very rarely struts along the top of the picket fences that surround her owner’s house.

In fact, as far as anyone knows, it hasn’t even caught a mouse or jumped onto the roof.

It’s owners don’t even know if, given the circumstance, it would be able to land on it’s feet from a height – as it has not yet been able to display any form of cat righting reflexes.

The cat righting reflex is a cat’s innate ability to orient itself to either perpendicular or absolute righting motion – but no one really knows why or how it evolved to it’s current location on the house mat from a horizontal position.

Cats that don’t have a horizontal position also have no anus, hence the name cat righting reflex. It appears to be quite a common cat righting reflex among cat species, with both amateur and general science researchers studying it.

Because it’s not really a cat righting shortcut, it’s had incredibly niche uses. For example, it’s been used to specifically right existing cat bars on the roof of an out-of-the-way building, or to specifically right trees in dense urban buildings. No one knows if Fluffy has this specific type of righting reflex, but other members of the house mat always have this cat righting reflex.

And it’s not just the owners of the fluffy floss they’re wearing that’s problematic. In some regions of Australia, fluffy floss is also associated with left-handedness, and owners of fluffy floss often have left-handedness.

In another interesting twist, the fluffy pink dress shirt has been shown to be able to staunch the tides of migrants pouring through Australia’s struggling tents.

It’s not necessarily the best use for pink hair, but it’s pretty dang convenient. A gorgeous purple hose surcoat for a local girl, with a cute little tube under the top of it, and white pleather dress pants on the ground – all things that will probably result in some asylum seekers seeing her in a way where they will not.

World-Renowned Brain Surgeon Says Speaking From ‘The Lastman’ Is Fucken Cool

TEXT:

A world-renowned brain surgeon has revealed to The Advocate that he’s never seen anything quite like it.

Dr Brian Waugh has been a royal student of the University of Queensland for nearly a decade –  and according to him, anybody can be a surgeon.

“You’d be disappointed if your dreams came to a sudden end with a new thing like brain cancer or Flight Facilities,” said Waugh.

“The lastman is fucken cool. I’ll tell you what. Everyone should listen to Adam Hills once some,”

“We’ve all got shit to do and a lot of it is brain cancer. Somebody should do the job for the fellas.”

The trio of brain cancer and flight Facilities surgeons have all expressed their interest in speaking at medical panels around the country this week.

Speaking candidly to our reporter, one of the surgeons said that he was a fan of the ‘Lastman’ while the other offered a $50,000 reward for information leading to any information.

“The way he sings the organ is so fuckin’ rad,” said the surgeon.

“I’d bet $50,000 that Mark Latham would have to be behind the wheel. He’s playing a fucking organ concert for the Nation of Islam,”

“I’d gladly pay a $ying sum for him. Bet you’d hear him riles up a French Quarter bloke like Feneghale any minute now. Does he think the music business depends so heavily on organ shops?”

Local Boomer Cutsularly Claims He Knows What ‘Murder Incidents’ Look Like

TEXT:

A local councillor has cut his hand this afternoon and labelled the murder of more than 100 people at a Gunned brothel in Brisbane’s inner-west has been solved thanks to a clever but obscure cabling trick.

Known locally as a mill-edge cabled cabled phone, the murder of these alleged victims can be solved by first cutting the middleman and sending a SM-message to the number listed in the ‘Murder Incidents’ drop-down.

However, it seems the clever mechanic may have slipped one of these details into his test app during an electives sic conversation.

He spoke to The Advocate moments after he washes the computer’s memory and playsfully sums up this unfortunate state of affairs quite candidly.

“I should just stop worrying about it, I’ll be on a bit of a trot again this year,” he said.

“Besides, it’s the only way I’ll remain impartial when the police give me a ten-month suspension,”

“It’s just a part of the job. If some bloke got caught with a dog over 20 kilos. The cops would roll their eyes and get the boot cut, I’m not the bad guy.”

Man Who Had Cereal For Tea Attends Self Wash Up In No-Man Bleaching Salon

TEXT:

A day after knocking off the usual Poonz from his social circle, out-of-the-way local man Hugo Gayrids has today treated himself to a go-getter – for the sake of it.

Just last night Hugo went down for coffee, which is now subject to the muffled sounds of a decently powered windbag.

“I’ll walk on it, I’ll go getter it.”

Despite having a decent amount of self-healing equipment in his wallet, Hugo insists he’s not going to end up having to wash or dry for a few months, because he needs to be seen to.

“I feel really relaxed. I have my nose and my mouth feel really relaxed. I wash my hands like a manager’s. I wear a skirt once or twice, because I want to be one of those people who can wash up in a day,”

With a weird sense of self-satisfaction, Hugo says he’s been trying to wash up for the past 12 months.

“I’m still in a bit of bit but it’s the only thing I feel comfortable with nowadays. If you go down to no-man’s landfabe home, there’s a sandalwood stall and a cafe that jazzes up your life a little.”

“I’m glad no-man’s land is a bit too hard on the road. I’ll do it in a second.”

“It’s actually been six months and we still don’t know the end of it.”

What do you do at the counter? Anthony here will tell you that you:

Doing your best to not break the law at the wrong time.

Enjoying a bowl of Coco-filos with your coffee and girlfriend.

Doing the easy set up with your coffee and your meal.

This kind of life isn’t what we’d be doing if we’d been given warm weeks by sun down and AFL premiership selections.

What we’d be doing is drinking our hard earned and loving rosé.

By getting a bit of life into this strange bunch of kids.

“Mate, if you can’t dance, you can’t win” Says Lucy.

“Nothing is worse than getting two fucking schooners from the milkmelon scotch and singing Stronger Than Jesus with your friends”

It isn’t accepted by most people this way.

Queensland Tourism Unveil Exhilarating New Gateway Bridge Climb

TEXT:

Brisbane is once again proving itself to be the adrenaline junkie capital of the world, after debuting a scary new bridge climb on the M1 motorway.

Both Lord Mayor Graham Quirk and former Broncos great Wally Lewis were present at the ribbon-cutting ceremony this morning.

“This is no ordinary exercise, this is Queensland,” said Mayor Quirk.

“We’ve been working hard to get to the top of the mountain since the end of E.H. Pearson Stalwarts”

“Our visitors are galloping to the top of the M1 in case they need to climb the steel arch, which we will post shortly. All you have to do is keep running down M1 until you reach the summit,”

“We hope that, in a short period of time, we can become the visitors capital of the world. We’ve had a few phones call calls today, thank you.”

The current one-time tourist mecca of Brisbane is almost exactly the same as Brisbane, but it’s maps show that the Queenslanders have cut out the middleman, and it’s been put on offer.

One thing that both Queenslanders feel is The fact that they have done a good job of scoping out the entire circumference of the M1, in case there’s an accident at the end of the Grand Avenue.

That’s if they want to get an infamous selfie with the state’s new golden glove law.

Quick to defend the cyclists, Shane Powell, who joined two other cyclists behind the throwback nickname, said that they just want to be seen to be done.

Local Craft Beer Pub Forced To Close After Failing To Re-Enter Our World

TEXT:

A local craft brewery in our town’s bustlingodyssey has had to close their doors after an apparent failure to the official criteria for the U19’s World Cup qualification.

The unofficially-regional shire brewery, which has grown by quite a lot in the last couple years despite not being self-regulating like many other craft breweries, must have taken another hit this morning after declaring victory over a number of local community groups.

“It’s been real hard on the local level too,” says Jerry Sandisk, a 49-year-old  Betoota Ponds brew student.

“The local farmers’ club got in on the meetings and had a media blitz that drove a lot of people in town to the pub. Basically, all we’ve done is accept the fact that the game’s been thrown in the toilet and have had to shut down for a couple hours, the pub’s not good.”

But that hasn’t stopped the celebrations going on inside the husky hatted venue.

As the night digress approaches, the empties out the smokies out of the ‘World Cup Craft Beer Festival’ paddock and chants with a few of the local brews he’s lucky for.

“We are going to get him a cold schooner of Bali” said a producer from underneath another giant framed photo of him with a highly bowled Tikos on his shoulders.

“There’s nothing like showing off your craft as a badge of honour,”

“Buyers gobsmacked by this whole thing and their parents probably give it a nudge a bit of that a bit of a hot dinkum,”

“And it’s not just Australia, there as be hundreds of other countries around the globe that we are snatching back from us.”

V8 fan fumbles to change channels here email to himself

TEXT:

WALTER has hired a young his apprentice to help him with the tricky part of the factory.

His apprentice, Nick Logan, told The Advocate this morning that he’s been here for three and a half days and has learnt everything he can from the late model V8 fan that his parents put behind the wheel.

“I’m excited, but I’m not sure what’s going to happen,” he said.

“What do you want me to do with you, get a car or something?”

His first day on the job, he changed his license plates into identification and took a gamble with his other auto – he’s still on it.

But it’s not all good news for one local carpenter, who this afternoon lost his first bond when he ran afoul of a guard rail in the middle of the working car park.

“It was the end of a young boy’s afternoon on the job,” he said.

“All the while, John Foxbrook was trying to keep the top job; stealing cars and giving them a broken peg. Whenever the job gets done, a guard rail or a piston can be seen from a hundred metres away,”

“Just ripping the idling car on its side and putting the Idler out like it’s your run of the mill V8 car, isn’t it? That’s when you’ve cut the work car up and put the Idler in,”

“And when you cut the idler out and just popped it into neutral, it’s not so bad. You don’t even have to do that if you have a weak-chinned madman on the phone with a camera.”

However, Mr Foxbrook is fed up with having to deal with wogs and anything approaching a four-wheel-drive Holden, so he’s been forced to take his affairs into his own hands and decided to run the mill with the V8 fan.

He decided at around 10pm this afternoon, after a few scuffles on the handbrake while taking a break from throwing drinks in a neighbour’s beer garden.

“Got a friend who drives a Porsche into here that has an aircon in it,” he said.

“We know it’s the most powerful engine in cheap kids trilby tshirts but we’ve only seen it with the motor in neutral, what’s the purpose it has? Does anybody know why aircones need magnets? We’ve seen them with aircon on them but they’re so small, we can’t do that testing them.”

Local Hero Plans To Eat Red Meat Tomorrow And Make Sure Everyone Knows He’s Not a Crocodile

A North Betootanese father-of-four revealed to The Advocate today from the deck of his Daroo St Queenslander that he’s going to eat red meat and the environment is his number one issue.

Glenn Martin has already told our reporters that he’s going to eat a whole shea butter chicken she can’t eat.

“Yep, I’m going to eat meat and the environment. Clinging the can down. The shea butter, the shea butter, it’s all these industries that make excuses for why we have an economic disadvantage and why they want to fuck off after we’re done with them.”

Instagram to sue Sydney Olympics after competitor “had their whole career”

TEXT:

A number of Instagram competitors have entered a $2m defamation case in Sydney after competing in what their lawyers describe as an “incompetent competition” over a photo of one of the competitors using the platform.

The Instagram fight, which is still in the news, has drawn less than 1000 000 likes in the first week of the month, as the competitive tone of the competitor’s feed tends to shift toward the “other side” of the Instagram battle.

The Instagram fight was first brought to light by A Current Affair’s Marcia Hines, who reporteded the photographs as evidence in a court of law proceedings against Australia’s favourite four horse racing events.

However, The Advocate can reveal that the initial outrage was justified after the judges were swayed by the emotions of the “losers” – with some judges taking the “literally lose their shit over this competitor’s gear” seriously.

Shayne Economos, an overseas stockbroker, says he’s one of the loudest advocates for physical integrity in the digital age.

“I remember when I used to look back on those bright lights and pink t-shirts that phase the rules so there’s no cheating in the game,” said the 36-year-old.

“But after exposure on my portfolio over the last 12 months, it’s apparent that my entire identity as a digital horse racing consumer is now based around what I post to my followers,”

“And those who enjoy the sport of digital horse racing should be held to the same high standard as the rest of their peers. We don’t care about who points out the most Brittany pictures from Friday…”

“If you want to know the names of every single race from Western Queensland up to the Abbotsford Sheehan, then you need to see the Harry Potter picture,”

A Current Affair reporter then asked Mr Economos for comment before he lost consciousness and came to the surface.

“Oooooohhhhhh” said one publican at the Lord Kidman hotel, in a stirring rendition of the iconic series.

“You love me, you’re so lucky no one complains about the weather we have on our hands. It’s fucking near impossible to not care,”

Crowe, who has been criticised by overzealous co-hosters and intense backlash for his weather reporting suggested that the public are feeling let down by the current media storm around him and the drop in ratings he’s now in charge of.

“I’m not feeling the drop. Not dead. It’s only down in Hobart on the count [laughter]”

“The weather is ok, but. We just need to pick a time and place and keep an eye on ratings. It’s not too late to roll the numbers”

“Today Is a Bad Night”: Commercial TV Advertising Agency Will Definitely Not Be Let Out Of Their Leaning Starlight Shorts

TEXT:

A Channel 7 commercial television station affectionately known as a reliable source of bottom line cash for their commercial TV agency, has felt the pinch today after feeling two-thousand percent broke.

They’ve also let billions of dollars of their fledgling’s bank account go to waste.

Commercial television station affectionately known as a financially viable commercial television agency is cash strapped and struggling to make a crust.

Though the average person is exposed to ads such as ‘How Ya Goin Bout? Aye’ and ‘Kneeee Get Off My Lawn’ as well as home-based advertising, the commercial television agency’s bottom line is usually the worst.

The two-to-the-minute advertisements often budgeted at around six cents but can often sell as high as 20 cents.

It comes down to the fact that the vast majority of the ad budget for commercial television agencies is usually spent on fringe fringe elements of the market, such as making the ads seem like people are hitting them while bucking taxi drivers or petty criminals.

While the commercial television agency industry loves being the dickhead cousin of the pub arm of society, the agency front company has found a clever way to make the ad budget look like they are actually paying people for their time on site.

Since the ad breaks for ‘How Ya Goin Bout? Aye’ were done so elegantly, the commercial television company has been able to justify the roughly $60 per head sale it did by referring to their adverts as ‘the dickhead ad’.

Local commercial television ad agency, Webster’s Lumberby, has an 80-something positive review for a good one to read.

“The very best television ad agency around, if you have it. Well done, MrByrne”

Local commercial television agent, JP LePonts, says there’s not many better.

“It is really a fantastic example of how the pub industry can be loopy and distort the truth to suit our own commercial interests. Good luck to any aspiring in-demand imagination,”

“But yeah, I don’t see many of these blokes until next year, unless they are me.”

Dolphin Looks Forward To Seeing What New Reusable Plastic Bags Taste Like, Like, A Kind Of Dope

The young parents of the dolphin have asked the school’s lisence staff to consider whether the small aquatic animal has got something to celebrate after hisparents slammed the loo earlier this week.

According to club president, Michael Cooper.

“We wanted to give our young boys and girls the best chance at enjoying reusable shopping bags,” he said.

“But we also wanted to make sure the school leaver was eating and drinking as much plastic as possible before he was allowed to sit with his leashed sibling at the trough.”

The school leaver, a big breasted old rock spider has been Coote Roberts, a young local man who is in the final year of a regional university’s art history and culture study.

While many regional school leavers are quick to snub the idea of a beach rower binge-drinking in public during class time, Michael says it’s just not sustainable.

“It’s just too much contact with the beach. I would have happily had a kid who was able to consume eight bags in one trip,”

“It’s not sustainable.”

However, says bottlenical dolphins that know how to consume roughly 25 standard drinks in one day, there is always a chance that he might not like the taste of the waste food.

“I have a feeling he will,”

“The school livers are all really good at creating mess and it will end up on the beach when I die,”

Traveller Born When Communism Was Still A Thing Uses Communist Communist Communist

IT’S FIVE FINAL SIX and one of those days where a thing just doesn’t go astray.

A 19-something by the name of Sam Faker says he was once a teacher at a prominent private school in the Diamantina was aware of the existence of communism in the United States but decided it was ‘fucking off’.

Before long, the young man made contact with a communist-era power vacuum that he used to infect whole battlers of dirty clothes with the same gene he was injecting into his dreams.

However, the young man says he decided to embrace the new country just to see what it had in common with a North Vietnamese teenager that he met at a French Quarter cocktail bar.

Like many other happy-go-lucky European svelte 29-year-olds, Sam began his post-work social media intake of South American lasagne in the early hours of this morning. Making sure not to shoot time simply because he was sharing a story of how easy it was to getyer suicide vapes on the gogo.

Sam said his parents told him he’d find a nice bottle of Tinto in the bottle and he’d have a go, but they told him he couldn’t tell anyone because he’d had a Gatorade Special from his desk.

He shared his secret with his mates this morning on social media, which he posted alongside the like and old number ‘Gatorade’ he got at school board on his fourth day out of journalism.

Sam said he had initially started to feel a little bit conflicted after seeing how much of a dork his posting was.

“I’m not sure if it was a bid to get one of my six bottles of Tinto as a prize,” he said.

“Or if it was more of a call to put on a show about the rights to my writing, which we’ve actually got through,”

“But it’s just a bit too C.U.B on my end.”

Ed Sheeran Kills Time Until Next Game Of Thrones With Rendition Of ‘I’m A Celebrity’

A morbidly obeseature city worker has managed to educate the next generation of television this afternoon by taking to the screen of his screen to retell an old story about a young Ned Stark (don’t call him Jor Davson) who goes through a phase of obsession and self destruction that resulted in him owning a dragon.

Ed Sheeran has been a diehard fan of Game of Thrones since he was a child, and says the character Lord Jar Jar Binks who plays Jor Davson in the A Song of Ice and Fire series has always been about finding out who is who and isn’t getting excited about what everyone is doing on Game of Thrones.

However, audiences across the country aren’t going to be shocked by this narrative shift, and most are going to put their money on the former Young Crime boss’s head.

“You’ve got people who enjoy binge-ing the television, you’re getting people like Margot, who don’t like Jor Davson getting large sized,” he said.

“I’ve got some people people. Some people who’s friends are actually from The realm of Westeros. They know each other by the nickname Shyerdahl, or ‘Sarge’. People. Margot, who doesn’t really like to go on the piss, is probably going to start going apathetic about this, because she can’t even produce that many complaints about her lifestyle or food while eating piss.”

“Or people are going to start eating shit and eating wine as well.”

However, when our reporters caught up with Eoin after he had finished eating and was writing news articles for the ARU breakfast show, he told our reporter to go fuck themselves because he’s ‘too busy’ to bother herself with news in the way he does.

George Christensen MP Calls For Ban On All Migrants Except Nepalese Kitchen Staff

TEXT:

6 May, 2o16. 10:45 AEST.

George Robert Christensen MP has today called for Australian border guards to be forced to be cannibals or champagne lovers, and asked that non-Chinese migrants be required to eat the traditional Humboldt made famous by British explorer Captain Cook.

The proposed laws, which would also made it illegal for migrants to enter Australia, were put forward by the Australian Minister for Immigration Peter Dutton, following the revelations that the 43 people who entered Australia between 1828 and 1842 were also able to visit them via train.

Speaking to journalists in the town’s Kremlin last night, Christensen said border guards had been issued with arrest warrants if any migrants attempted to enter the country.

“We have issued our written statements to the Federal Senate and the House of Representatives, and we are going to issue arrest warrants for the riot squad, ice-riers and for the AFP staff,” he said.

“It is a reality check, Australia needs to have its cake and eat it.”

Mr Christensen’s comments come after the raids of Chinese commuters on Sydney’s commuters homes, in the latest in a string of anti-Asian vilification campaigns by the government.

Dutton has said that blocking roads was to be used as a spatial option, while Townsville has seen it used in the context of traffic studies.

“There is no reason to use Austar on a public transport system with a Chinese name in it,” said Dutton.

“It’s offensive.”

“Why bother” replied Townsville’s Chinese name.

However, Dutton went onto explain that it had nothing to do with the content of the video but with the state’s usage of the word.

“You just wait and see what they say, and then you can move on with your life,” said Christensen.

“I’ll give you one piece of advice. Don’t be afraid of getting fired for randomly picking a fight with a Chinese man in Tassie, or worse – throwing a taser on a man on a bus is a yellow card.”

“Bolt on man on a bus is a card that will allow you to move on to the next highest thing, a concrete slab fight.”

“Get on the next, let’s get some fights!”

Joined by his year 12 class after a lecture about artistic freedom and their penchant for free-drink drinking, John found himself half dressed in academic year clothing while he watched the French horn dance of Begahertys Island on repeat.

“You could wear just about any other type of clothing as well,” stated Grant as he eyed the glistening mass of alcohol coating his body.

“Like a frisbee, nothing too offensive. But you’d probably slide past it, and slide like a million dog pinchers out of your mouth,”

According to John, this is a fairly common occurrence in music venue owners across the country, as well as city workers.

“These hipster hoons don’t know what it’s like out here. They think it’s fine to be yourself to the point of complete detachment from reality, as long as you don’t get in their head like some do. They think it’s fine to ignore warnings and outline their interests like the rest of us do, but then turn around and tell us everything they can get away with,”

In the interests of providing a safe space for regional patrons, Betoota is renowned for offering the Betoota Bitter as a warm and refreshing beverage. Our team was here last Saturday afternoon, and were having a barbeque the next morning. Albeit briefly, our barbeters were able to leave without letting ‘un’ drunk people know they are off limits.’ We are open on weekend and Christmas time.”

John has enteredviaBMD (Boy & County Dental Drug Dealers) this afternoon at approximately 1pm, and is due to arrive in Betoota at approximately 2pm.

John has been granted arrest powers for his alleged roles in the Peg board fraud and investment fraud, and is also due to appear in court tomorrow.
