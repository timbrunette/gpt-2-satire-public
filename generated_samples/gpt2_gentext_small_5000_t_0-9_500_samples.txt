First Fruit Of Living Under These Horrific Invasions Will Be The Good Shit That Never Cares

TEXT:

As the first fruit of an idle quarter comes rolling in tomorrow’s, day, and night, the Diamantina Shire is treating the weekend as though it’s a sunny day out – with a refreshing periwinkle pie in the fridge, and next month’s collection of princesses with sparkling white hair swinging in the breeze.

One of the shire council areas in Betoota that literally lives up to the name – Betoota – is home to a generation of young bogans who were raised in a lavish, middle-class setting who can be easily influenced by online trends and pointless wear-on merchandise from their grandma’s photoshoot studio.

From November until the break, local publican Bruce Grange (72) has given the neighbourhood 15 years worth of wear-on, and toasted sandwiches and hotdogs.

“I’ve told everyone this morning that this is one of the best days of the year for a whole number of reasons,” said Grange. “Firstly, we get the hell out of bed. And secondly, so have everyone else.”

“Not everybody has access to that break that goes with smoking and/or binge drinking, but everyone can get pissed enough to get the Viber.”

Having never seen or heard of other countries – such as Australia – it is not yet known what to make of the first sight the worker ants are putting on their television, while they rip in with their weekly Christmas dance and woohoo! that is! – the opening track off of Australian indie-rock’s classic anthem, Who Killed The World.

“Can’t Wait For The New Stadiums,” Says Sydneysider Over The Top

TEXT:

A spokesperson from the nation’s hospitality industry has today revealed that their is a long history of not letting the weather control with overly effeminate residents opting to show up at sporting events with the intention to consume large amounts of alcohol.

With the NSW State Government’s decision to allow the state-run Adani mine on the Brown Snake well well publicised throughout the country, well recognised as one of the most important and exciting new developments in tourism, well known by everyone from young parents to old folks with passion for visiting the Queensland armbis, to let them know that it won’t be getting in the way of their holiday.

“Yep, the Stadium System will be there,” said the hospitality industry representative, Will Brooks.

“Aaah, yeah but nah, we’ll be there,” said the spokesperson referring to the new Stadium, also known as the Brown Snake.

While locals and tourists alike will be happy to see the new Stadium opening up and showcasing the natural beauty and history within the Great Barrier Reef, many Indigenous people and people from the Queensland townships where the new Stadium is located will be happy to see it take another crack.

“Yep, we’ve actually seen it before,” the representative laughed.

“When I moved to the NSW side of the family, the Cowboys were the only team that didn’t leave the house in a wet day. The people were wild around the bush, the surf was rough, and it was pretty bad. It’s just what Queenslanders do when they get the opportunity to be in the top six pack and compete for prizes.”

Man Unknowingly Promoting The Bachelorette With One Swipe At The Pub

TEXT:

A local man has been discreetly showing off his newly acquired skills with one swipe at the pub before handing the maid off to the main character in what many have described as a blatant joke.

One thing that Bryan Watson didn’t show off was the fact that he has been using his quick little fingers to swipe left and up against anyone who asks him for their autograph. 

The fact that he even has his own podcast at the very least suggests he may have gotten a bit too worked up about what he has been doing.

“Well, I just pretended to keep my mouth clean while I scoured the venue” Watson said.

“The fact that I am even drinking this shit makes me wonder if I am even a real person”

“Maybe I am just a bit slow on the uptake.”

Watson told us that he is in the process of changing his Instagram profile to show a more engaging, family friendly side.

“Maybe that’s something I should start doing.”

Wedding DJ Praises God For Bringing Sing For Carmen And Yumi

TEXT:

In a touching display of Australianiculturalism and soul, a wedding DJ was held back by duties to make sure no one was singing Carmen and another one was singing Yumi when the guests arrived.

“God brought us this Sing because we love Carmen and Yumi and we love him and we love this country and we love this city” said Marjorie Koutka (46), who was asked to be the lead singer of the well-known romantic comedy band Carmen.

“Sing, love, sing!” she lead from the front bar of the Betoota Dolphins Leagues Club.

It was the opening lyrics from Yumi Portmbieff’s 2003 hit, Sing Me Yours, Carmen, that decided Joh and Johanne Portmbieff were on the right path. Yumi Portmbieff has been a Hollywood superstar since she appeared in the 1990 film, Carmen.

“Love conquers all… If I… Love conquers all… If I love my God, there is love in Carmen and Yumi…” she sung.

Local couple, Bella and Johnathan Whitelock (bothsp), were slightly more optimistic about Port’s chances of making it. However, both of them admit that they should have been more optimistic about the whole Sing thing.

“It’s a big win for love!” said Johnathan.

“I’m sick of hearing about this… It’s not very Love… Love is my strength and I love it!”

The couple also implored Joh and Johanne to not give their love for their respective countries the attention they are currently wreaking out in the streets.

“I’m so sick of it! Do we have to let love take control of our lives? Or are we supposed to be controlling it”

Spice Girls Under Threat Of Dismantle Harassing Teenagers Into Eating Spice Girls

TEXT:

It has been confirmed today that Spice Girls Australia is not in danger of going broke as the fallout from the group ‘celebrity’ trend has shown that it’s not hard to be successful in an industry with few to no employees.

The news comes after over 20 000 Spice Girls’ songs were deleted from social media platforms yesterday, after #BringThemSpiritsDay and #ChangeItAll led to a backlash. 

The trend, which is named after a Spice Girls Australia theme, has triggered outcry from Australian women, and prompted an investigation by the director general of the pop group.

The news comes after over 20 000 Spice Girls’ songs were deleted from social media platforms yesterday, after #BringThemSpiritsDay and #ChangeItAll led to a backlash. 

“People are not being led astray by this trend,” said lead singer Amy Winefront.

“Spice girls are so relevant in today’s young people, they are being deleted from social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. 

“I mean fuck, it doesn’t make sense that these stupid fat little pricks are still around,” said Wineback.

The investigation has found that the delete/move campaign was very successful in removing Spice Girls Australia’s songs from popular music platforms like YouTube, and Spotify. 

“I don’t blame them, they are just so relevant now.” 

The report found that the entire industry is essentially on the nose of innovation by the #BringThemSpiritsDay hashtag and by the #changeitallallall together. 

The report also found that the entire industry is now in danger of being shut down entirely. 

The conclusion of the report follows a recent report by the Business Intelligence Unit of the Federation Trade Union Kiev, recommending that governments “heed and respect the law” when it comes to tech start-ups. 

Representatives from Spice Girls have also commented on the report, stating that “it is a terrible example of judicial dereliction of duty.”

Man With Undiagnosed Gluten Intolerance As Status Quo Quite Vivid With Leftie

TEXT:

A self-confessed free spirit who has somehow found his way back into mainstream Australian society, Sam Dunkeld (32) has spent the last three hours being asked to ‘say nothing’ about what is happening in the world today.

While wearing a blackface make-out shirt and jeans, Dunkeld appears to be relishing in the identity crisis currently gripping him. Though he has yet to find the strength to stay on his moral high horse, and is refusing to condemn what he perceives as a culture of privilege.

Throughout the interview, Dunkeld rants about race, disability and anti-intellectualism, as well as about his misplaced desire to please white girls with uncouth opinions.

“So basically, is it me?” asks Dunkeld.

“Oh god, just stop saying that!” he raps unironcited.

“You know what they say!”

Uncle Brendan (known as 0-Dog) and his father, Bruce (known as Uncle Brendan’s Uncle) have spent the last two hours attempting to come to terms with the fact that Sam Dunkeld is now in exile with a toxic sense of entitlement, and a deep-seated sense that he should be seen leaving.

“So what’s he gone and what’s he gone and gone about?”

Sam asks Uncle Brendan why he doesn’t just try and explain to him that he should be grateful for the gluteniness of people who are easily disposable and on the run from criticism.

“I don’t know,” says Uncle Brendan.

“I’m not sure.”

Uncle Brendan, who claims to be a supporter of gay marriage, immediately runs out of words, and soon-to-be-former goes home.

Boomers Celebrate Israel Folau Arrival By Storming Out Of The PMPersonality

Prime Minister Scott Morrison has confirmed today that he is still enjoying his holiday in Israel, after Prime Minister Scott Morrison told the media that Scott Morrison is the best Prime Minister for Israel, at the risk of his personal reputation and role as a representative for the best, brightest and brightest of Australia’s upper-middle-class.

“Hmm. Good to see I’m not going to Strasbourg, mate” said the PM, during an interview with local radio station KKI.

“I have been in Israel a few times this year. It’s a nice place, and I’ve always wanted to be a politician. Scott Morrison is the best, if not the best representative for Australia’s upper-middle-class,” Morrison said.

“Personally, I reckon it’s best toingle with Scott Morrison in Australia’s working-class communities. I used to think he used to be a politician, but he’s just spent the last twenty years campaigning to be a representative for the working-class.”

Morrison said he’s going to see how Scott’s relationship goes over the next few weeks, as he seeks to find a way to appeal to disgruntled, often left-wing Australians who don’t feel represented at the international stage.

“Scott told me last week that he’s moving to Hobart to run against the wall, so I guess I’m moving up a notch a bit” said Morrison, before adding “I’ll have to see how I feel about that one coming up”.

First Bootleg Using USB After Surprise Boot Load Results In A Gateway Trip

Tissue Thrown Onto Sydney’s Beach

SYDNEY’S BANDOOTA SAID “Australia will not leave Sydney. You’re not listening” this morning as a band of South West Queenslanders threw tissue and bone into Sydney’s iconic beach.

The decision by the cadaver of organs and gear carrying delegates declared war upon Sydney as a “town of broke workers”.

It comes after the cadaver of organs and gear and props and supplies arrived in from Ascot, West End and parts of Macquarie Fields.

Premier Annastacia says it is good to see such a politicised industry sprouting up in her place.

“Ahhh shit. These are good potato gems. I am going to be the captain of these truckers” said the Premier.

“Now if only we could find a way to strip this shit of ya”

“Now wouldn’t ya”

The announcement was met with chuckles from the crowd who included the BeeGees, The Betoota Bugle, Kodak and of course Prime Minister Scott Morrison.

“Good to see ya” said the Premier.

“Haven’t you been listening mate? Haha”

The Premier continued the line of questioning before the crowd.

Heads grow weary of inquisitive Coles team after lengthy weekend

TEXT:

Rather than hurl myself off the face of the Earth into deep space, the brains of Coles Marketing team have been copping the rare Friday arvo drop at Coles this week.

Though it’s not a good sign for managing a company, the five-hour-stand-off ended well after the grub-rip of David Bowie-style hair loss.

“We can’t say too much. After all this is going on, do we really want to continue this?” said one Coles team member.

“But let it be known, we are not the Cieloaters of the world. Coles suits are about as human as humanly possible.”

That fact has put the rest of the team’s distantly-held opinions into perspective.

“We’re the shareholders, so we’ve got nothing to hide. So naturally, when the stock goes up, we take the plunge,” said engineer Miles Hogmann.

The 25-year-old said his parents told him he’d have to do it because of the cost and the risk of losing his job if he did it.

“But I guess I just try to be as transparent as humanly possible with my story and my story is a cautionary tale to those who are feeling the effects of the Great Recession,” he said.

“Also, it’s great to have a supportive family member that’s either a family or a friend. We’ve got cousins in law and medicine too, don’t we?”

Prime Minister Abbott Targets New “Labor” Position In Federal Parliament

TEXT:

The former head of the NSW Liberal Party and the former leader of the anti-gay marriage lobby has called on the new Federal Liberal Party to take up a role in federal parliament.

In an interview with Marie Claire magazine, Malcolm Turnbull outlined that he had received assurances from his Labor colleagues that he would not seek a “Labor” position in Wentworth, despite declaring he would support a Liberal bid for the seat.

He also said he had always been a “Labor voter” and that he did not mind New South Wales more as a result of the “Orange revolution” than it as a result of being the only place he voted.

In the 18 months since the birth of the beloved children of immigrants, there has been yet to be a Liberal MP in the country who claimed to have never voted, ever.

However, in a stunning display of bipartisanship and defiance against the odds, the Prime Minister has reversed his position and reversed his position very shortly after he announced his plans to announce “new Labor” as the party’s official stance on gay marriage.

Turnbull told those aligned with him in Parliament House today that he was announcing a “Labor” if you will excuse me” – as he does every time a member of the opposition party says they will vote against gay marriage, which he says is a matter for the plebs.

“I’m not sure if youre all all dumber, champ [sic]” he said.

“But let’s just get one thing out of my way. I am an equal and economic minder. There’s plenty of me in this country who think it’s important for us to be like the Others, not for hers [sic]”

“If you’re reading this. You’re dumb. I don’t care. Go back and read the rest of it. Chuckle.”

Bathurst Police Cadet Shot In Exact Image Of 2015 Bathurst Police Cadet

TEXT:

While most of the nation looks on with glee at the spectacular Bathurst 1000 motor race that stops a hundred thousand people for a bumper sticker, a local Bathurst Police cadet has been spotted going about his day at a local training academy.

While many people in Australia and the world have written off the event as a fluke, some pundits have questioned whether it has anything to do with race day.

The current champion Scott Kelly has been selected to lead the Bathurst Police Cadet and Cadet Selection, which selects the polices of the Bathurst Police Force.

The Cadet, Mr Chipmen, says he has had a strong effort over the past 12 months and believes he has shown he can put the finishing touches on his “perfectly-indicated booth” at the racecourse.

“I’ve put together a pretty good unit,” says Mr Chipmen.

“They’re a good bunch of boys,”

“And I thought they’d make a good showing. I’m looking forward to seeing them on the day. The atmosphere here is good, there’s no one here to root and the only reason why it is here is because one of the boys is a local Liberal.”

With thousands of people tuning in to the race from Bathurst this weekend, the cadet’s display of community spirit was impressive enough to warrant a visit from his mate, Mr Flatly.

Throughout his service to improve the local police force, Mr Flatly provides valuable situational awareness and situational awareness while also providing break-through and keeping the focus on killing only as many Nazis as possible.

While Mr Kelly says he is disappointed by the lack of action taken by the local police on Sunday, he says it is a shame that it won’t affect the race that much.

“This will just be a couple more weeks until we are all good to go”

Scientists Receive $100M To Research Why You’re Missing Out On Some Groceries

TEXT:

As if streaming 60 hours of Nickelodeon Network programming didn’t get enough of a beat, the nation has today received another treat – an $100 million grant from the Federal Government.

The $100 million is just one of many new details about the $50 billion dollar study that is to be run by the CSIRO into why people sometimes forget to eat during the week.

“It’s really exciting,” said Penny O’Leary, spokeswoman for the federal department of agriculture.

“We just got funded to the point where we can no longer say no to a grant like this. It’s a bit like being a tax accountant, rather than just a repetitive task set in stone for many years. There are jobs available, though. Some nights are even said to last a week, others a month,”

“That’s not a task, that’s actually a way of life. A machine. People forget to do it. Machines fail, people lose their jobs and the economy crashes. The ABC is like a raincoat. Don’t get me wrong, I love the show.”

The ABC is a locally-owned, publicly-owned broadcasting station with more acre-feet in the Sydney metro and a profit margin of over 30 per cent. It is led by presenter David Koch and executive producer Alan Jones.

The CSIRO is developing a report into the show, with a particular focus on why Australians sometimes forget to eat during the week.

The news comes after the news broke that a quarter of a century ago, thousands of Australians were forced to eat during the week, which led to thousands more seeking treatment from hospital on the second night of rain.

Entrepreneur From Sydney Finally Gets To Do Some Of The Racist Shit He Did For A Year Ago

TEXT:

The area that hosted the first “Uncle Tony” riots has hosted its share of white nationalist protests since the tragic Southern Cross Anti-Rape Week scuffle in April has seen a large reduction in both crime and extremist ideology, The Advocate can reveal.

This comes after the second cousin of the Black Lives Matter movement was labelled a “hate group” by the NSW government this week.

The NSW government has confirmed that the newly created Anti-Rape Commission will not be made up of anyone who advocates hate and marginalise victims of crime.

Instead, the Anti-Rape movement will be made up of an open-minded community of activists who want to tackle systemic issues of inequality and culture of violence within our society – just like the ones that happened in the United States of America a decade ago.

The original “Uncle Tony” riots were triggered by a Queensland-based group of activists who were upset about being asked to leave a popular music festival because some of the people they cornered were Aboriginal.

The original “Rape Week” protests were sparked by Uncle Tony X taking a black public during a rally against the forced removal of a statue of B.D. H. Williams from Musgrave Street.

Uncle Tony X was filmed taking aim at B.D. H. Williams for his Indigenous activism, and titled it “The day the southern empire wants to take its place”, and was subsequently removed from Musgrave Street protest and replaced with a white group called the CTE Taskforce.

As one of the last white Canberra professionals who actually attend music fetes, Uncle Tony X was honoured with the award at the start of this year.

It is believed that even though he was never challenged by anyone of African background in high school, because he worked for the government until he finished university, he was finally accepted into the Australian Institute of Sport.

“Please Stop Blocking Me. I Don’t Want To Scroll” Says C.W.A

The C.W.A (Canadian American Aboriginal and Islanderrepresentative) have today announced a new wave of protests in support of their struggles against the Trump administration, first in response to the executive order that has blocked media outlets from reporting on the protests against the LGBTQI rights order.

A number of groups, namely the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and People For The Ethical In Love (PETA) have lashed out at the proposed ban, saying that it is a “foot soldier” for the government against which they have no compassion.

“I mean, if you don’t hate Barack Obama, then you’ve got no compassion,” said one spokesperson.

“It’s not that hard to love someone. Except when they do something wrong, like when Obama tried to ban genital mutilation in response to gay marriage, then you’ve got a moral imperative to show compassion,”

“And that’s what we are doing. It’s not hard to love an Obama-era sociopath. Showing compassion for the LGBTI community is a cardinal rule of Christianity. And that’s not even including gay marriage!”

Ablis, a spokeswoman for the ‘People For The Ethical In The World’ (PETA) claims they are very disappointed that their organisation has to suffer the indignity of openly advocating for non- compliance with the most basic human rights, as well as advocating for an increase in the minimum wage.

“We are disappointed that our organisation has to suffer through this. PETA are a representative example of people who aren’t able to change the world, and unfortunately we are treated every day on a almost daily basis by the government to tell us how terrible and disgusting it is to live with a minority. We’re sick of it.”

Link Established Between Winning Grand Slams And Getting In Alumni Quits

TEXT:

An online community of hackers has been active for some time now, where they aim to find the source of great success in their careers.

One of the earliest users is a 29-year-old surfer from Wacolle, south-west Queensland, who identified his success through social media.

One of his most popular videos has been liked by over 1000,000 people and it shows two girls, both tennis playing, tapping on the top of a pool table that has been created by another surfer, Stutterer Dutchen, 23.

The three of them are shown breaching the lid of the table, where they discover they have won an individual Grand Slam (State Of Origin) gold medal, a number that cannot be verified by the Elias Elias Centre.

The girls are shown as black slaps are repeatedly on top of their heads and their faces are shown as blood trickling out of their mouth. Stutterer begins cracking and losing his edge. The videos have been viewed more than 11 million times by Australian households and teachers.

Stutterer’s crack has been likened to that of the world record breaking American player, complete with the much-hyped up-close-but-no-sense-in-the-world-breakthrough.

The Australian Open, which is currently played on a giant 4X 4x 4x television, is a dual-tactical game, played with the same rules as the Australian Open but with a completely different format – the women’s game.

The Australian Open is a four-on-the-field style that pits each player on a horse, the men’s on the court, with the women’s looking like the game of tennis is over for the time being.

Four players from each position are dealt a life experience, a set of challenges that challenges them in various areas of their game. Each player must succeed on one of the challenges and must then choose which scenario of the game they is in. Each scenario includes punishment for infidelity, necrophilia, and cannibalism.

One player, a 40-year-old financier turned professional swimmer, says he is feeling really excited about coming to Almaty – but it all comes down to feeding off the horses.

“The first thing I did was go and watch the documentary, it’s on the same day as the Australian Open” he said.

“And there’s only 40 minutes of it. So I took the rest out of the microwave. I’ve been to Alpe d’je, that old French place near the beach. Very nice. Food isn’t too busy there”

A contestant from Australia’s Got Talent says the Nats always win.

“They’ll win a big one. That’s if they are going to show off their knowledge and understanding of the art of swimming. If they don’t, they don’t deserve to win anything by rote,”

“Either that, or they are going to spend the rest of their days on the couch watching the greatest drama on television. I don’t see what all these people asking for these things are doing here.”

“Haha, yeah! This fucking music festival is so gross!”

TEXT:

A community of hungry regional birds has been praised by the Australian government for hosting a massive music festival on the edge of the town’s main business district overnight.

It was met with unbridled glee from the residents of the small farming town on the southern tip of Brisbane’s CBD – a town that’s known for it’s rowdiness and over-fun sensitivities.

“I think people are confused,” said one government official.

“Well, we’ve already got all these amazing music festivals going on down south. We don’t want any more blowups down in Cairns, so why bother with something that has already been approved by council?”

“I don’t think people are surprised that this small community of jaded regional birds choose to enjoy jamming into a guitar or something.”

The official explained that it’s all part of the charm of small country towns – and the government hopes that the tens of thousands of regional birds that have been dragged out of town by the Queensland government and set alight on the flash beach will encourage them to set themselves alight again.

Russell Crowe to sue ABC for providing him with platform to voice his own political opinions

TEXT:

The ABC has extended an olive branch to Netflix this morning after it was revealed that Russell Crowe will sue the network for creating a platform for him to voice his own political opinions.

“Yes,” said ABC Director Michelle Guthrie.

“I agree that there is a clear-cut case for producing his character in a way that will not compromise the integrity of the show’s storyline but also to appease his requests to not cut his voice to make it appear angry or hostile,” she said.

“However, we don’t want Crowe to lose his mojo,”

“In saying that, we’re happy to leave Crowe in the cold.”

The Advocate reached out to all 12 networks for comment but only Waleed Aly said he was not going to sue ABC for the rights and that it was an “easy mistake to make”.

Expecting new leadership spill for another day

TEXT:

IN A MOVE TO BECOME PM JULIA Gillard the timid country youth senator did today not expect the biggest story-spinner in history to spill over into the Liberal Party’s leadership.

Earlier this year, Julia Gillard’s closest personal ally admitted that it was an inevitable consequence of not having any form of leader who could motivate the country to do something it once did.

“It wasn’t even that we’ve had one leader in the past” said Mr Abbott.

“I’m a politician. I have a voice. I can make a difference”

This time around, the nation’s politicians are taking their seats in the upper house and not Julia Gillard.

Speaking to the media earlier this morning, Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack said he did everything he could to oppose the spill.

“It was all part of a plan to derail Scott Morrison’s plans to take over as leader of the Coalition” said the Deputy Prime Minister.

“In terms of my mind, all this is a bad thing”

“I’m not sure why I’m being such a hypocrite. It’s not good for Prime Minister Scott, who by this stage in my career I still feel like I’m basically the same person back home”

However, Mr Abbott has hit back saying he didn’t expect the Australian public to like or even care about the inner-city Greens staffers who are actively being replaced by tertiary-educated Labor MPs.

“I didn’t expect any of the public to like or care about the Greens” said the Deputy Prime Minister.

“I didn’t expect people to like or care about this ScoMo”

“I just had a very, very public public public publicance on me last night”

“To suggest that people like me, as opposed to the media, can have a go and be good guys for all of the wrong reasons is preposterous”

Tradies Celebrate A Simple 8-Month-Long Open Mic Survives Struggle Against The Slash

A popular local tradies has today shared her bittersweet defeat after successfully resisting the urge to eat until 10:30pm. 

The girl group, which includes sister sister Kati, 16, 20, 29, and nephew nephew Kaleem, 32, has managed to stay together despite a month-long struggle. 

Kati joined her sisters in a heavy-wear off Friday, throwing open their doors at 11pm last night after a close call and a full moon.

The sisters put their hands up and ate until around 4 tomorrow, pushing their way through the cold and heavy night as they went.

“We’d have a great big weekend if we stayed active,” explained sister Kati. 

“And we’re still hungover.” 

“I think I’ve got what it takes to do yoga on the side.” 

“Not wanting to kill myself would be a great sign.” 

It’s believed that for her part, Kati was looking forward to a smooth shutdown after the weekend and the win. 

“Ha ha ha,” said cousin Kati.

“8 hours late, I’ve got everything sorted.”

“Eat until 10pm and I’ll have a nice cold beer in the kitchen, that kinda comes easy enough.”

Kati and her sister finished their meal almost an hour early, waiting for the return of the service desk.

“Might start in ten minutes. Enjoy the fat dog. Enjoy the fat dog.”

Geoffrey Rush Joins Dutton As Guest Speaker For Future Parliamentary Magna Carte Discussion

Former National Party stalwart and litigator Geoffrey Rush will table his $1,000 entry-level role at the next sitting of the House of Representatives.

A role which he insists will befitting of the retired warhorse MP, who retired at 68 earlier this year and who’s still making a living selling newspapers in Canberra as a private schoolboy, has been invited to appear at the next sitting of the House of Representatives.

Mr Rush, who retired at 68 after serving as counsel to the prime minister, will be joined by his brother Hugh Hugh Jr. as Guest Speaker for the House of Representatives Discussion & Debate.

“It’s a role model for young kids,” said an angry Geoffrey Rush today on 2GB talkback.

“He’s not a tax man or a corporate man. He’s a NSW politician. This is an honour system that rewards people who deliver change, not people who deliver policy that will benefit everyone.”

“I will be attending the next sitting of the House of Representatives, so anyone who wants to take the time to learn the next sitting will be sitting with me.” he said.

The now Member for Grayndler has drawn criticism for his low-key, family friendly manner and penchant for making good wine and cheese.

A self-confessed Greens soft staffer recently told The Advocate that Mr Rush was “intentionally a bit soft” by taking the time to mingle his way into the house and try to put the sicko’s entire life on hold while he tried to play God.

Local and International Student Show Off Their Special Burner Tattoo As Permission Slip Past Pool Table

TEXT:

A local and International student has today shown off their special burner tattoo, in an effort to pass time.

The and Foreign Student In Conversation, Pammy, says the piece of legislation she’s referring to is one they came up with 20 years ago, when she was studying medicine at St. Paul’s College.

“Yeah. Anyway,” she says, quite confidently, taking a sip from a St. Paul’s hot chocolate.

It’s believed the local government was the first to ‘ban’ smoking in government buildings, in what has been labelled an ‘effigy’.

While the legislation didn’t come into force until 20 minutes ago, the initial ban was rolled back over time as the University of Queensland slowly built the foundation for a built environment for their students.

“This is way worse than what we had imagined they might do,” says student Ashley Reid, who plays pretend permission slip on the wall at St. Paul’s College.

“I mean, you get 20 different students and the first one they ban is one of them having fucked up like me!”

“I don’t understand how they ban things like this.”

Universities around Australia start following the lead of the government after this latest tragedy, opting to just ban smoking in government buildings as a last resort.

“That way when you get home, you don’t have to do that whingeing [laughs] every morning that you’ve just kicked up ten minutes.”

Michael Pinochet, head of the Earth’s agricultural lobby group, Campaign Party, spoke to The Advocate this morning about the green forward he is hoping to have in the 2020 census.

“I’m hoping we can get through this year with a few bags of marinated cabbies,” he said.

“Marijuana is my number one drug and I want to ensure it gets into every toilet, stick and head. Not just that. So I’m hoping it doesn’t get in there. It’s gotta be the number 1 drug in this country, right?”

Mr Pinochet then spent the next few minutes explaining how heuses the marijuana flowering plant to growers and sellers, in an effort to reduce the amount of carbon monoxide that would end up in the atmosphere and land on the bottom shelf of the global ecosystem.

“These greenies love a few kilos of pot to smother their waste,” he said.

“We could do with lettuce, too. But the cost is a million percent. So we might as well cut the pay if we don’t get the government the money,”

“So we are looking at doing a bit with that, it’s only about $600 and a half. More than enough tosthe Greens party. It’s not too bad, though.”

The Government hopes that the new lock-out laws will help flush some out.

This comes as the Victorian Liberal government looks to pass its own version of legislation to strip banks of their $17bn funding injection in to measures to decriminalise recreational drug use in Victoria.

Approved Anti-Doping Protocols Put NSW In Touch Of Next Event

TEXT:

After another year and two copious boondoggles, Mike Baird has confirmed today that he is very excited to announce that NSW Anti-Doping has approved a protocol aimed at trialling next year’s event in Kings Cross.

The controversial anti-doping protocol was developed to prevent the extremely high levels of performance drug trialled in order to put NSW in the best position to host State Of Origin Game in 2019.

It has already been confirmed that this event will be much bigger and more attention grabbing than last years Kings Cross event and Mike Baird really no longer has to worry about organising this type of thing.

“I can’t wait to see the reactions of people when these controversial devices are thrown in front of us” says the Premier.

“Hopefully we get a couple thousand boondoggles to throw in Kings Cross at the next State Of Origin game. It’s a whole lot of fun”

However, NSW Police Minister Troy Grant says that this new anti-doping protocol has already been approved by the Anti-Doping Ombudsman and they aren’t planning on bringing any more boondoggles to the event.

“At this stage it is too early to comment on the validity of the protocol”

“However, we are planning on bringing any special reports and recommendations to bear on the implementation of the protocol. Until then, we don’t plan on bringing any more triage chairs to the event. Until we get more people involved in the boondoggles thing”

Local Human Forced To Watch ABC TV Program With Panamanian Exemption

TEXT:

A Betoota Heights man has had to duck into the bathroom this morning after being prevented from watching an ABC television program.

Blake Marshall, a 27-year-old commercial leasing agent from the Flightpath District, was enjoying a cigarette when he was saved by the ABC’s special exemption for him to watch the ABC late last night.

Blake was exempt from the usual application for late night media passes – which is the media pass application window that expires 30 days after first broadcast.

However, Channel Nine’s cross-selection panel discussion with political and social commentator Miranda Devine provided the only window of exemption for the 27-year-old former private school pupil.

Speaking exclusively to The Advocate, Blake said he gave Miranda a nudge in the front of the bathroom, only to learn that the ABC is only a few days away from making it’s way up the mountain, not before.

“You can’t come in here and watch the news with Miranda and I will have my exemptions,” he said.

“Even for a red-blooded Darwinian I would have given them a wave. Neither of us are journalists. We live in fear that the ABC will freeze over in the coming days,”

“Miranda really is the only one here with an immunity for us. I’m going to tell you something for free. When are you gonna do it? When will it start? Soon.”

When asked if he was prepared to face the prospect of being told how to ride a horse in an ABC documentary, Blake said he was.

“If people can’t afford to pay for such an ‘expedite’ as the ABC, then they can fuck off. I’m already paying for the doco, doco,”

“When?”

Australia’s new intake of refugees has been announced in a secret agreement between the federal government and Immigration Minister Peter Dutton, following the revelations of child sex crimes committed by former asylum seeker parents.

It is believed that the secret agreement was put in place so refugees could be listed under a wide variety of laws and immigration ministers had each year, when they were processing them.

The secret agreement was put in place so refugees could’ve been listed under a wide variety of laws and immigration ministers had each year, when they were processing them.

Peter Dutton has defended the new policy, telling reporters this morning in Brisbane that he believes the policy is working.

“Well, a lot of these refugees need to be listed. I think it’s working,” he said.

“I’ve got half a mind to give it to refugees. I’ve read up a lot on the subject, and it seems to work for some of the refugees,”

“I don’t know why you guys are so adamantly denying it works. It doesn’t,”

“I’m only asking questions about the immigration minister, who is only here for a few months now,”

“And the government just told me it’s in their national security to deny it working, so I can just tell them what to do. Now what?”

The independent study concluded that the government policy has nothing to do with national security, but rather is with pandering to corporate-liberal-male-dominated societal responses.

“Genocide Day” Announces Bankrolled By Colleagues

November 14, 2016 10:00 AM

The Betoota Advocate today revealed the origins of a seemingly run-of-the-mill organised crime network infamous back when the 1993 Simpson case was still being worked on.

Now, with the release of the new season, The Madden NFL 18, a legitimate and very public chapter in the Madden scandal has been written in the sportsbook community.

The Madden rebel gangster mob known as the ‘Mighty8’ have disrupted Sydney’s game and pubs in an attempt to intimidate the Officeworks workforce into not leaving the game early.

It is believed that the Madden Superstar gang will be especially hard hit by the violence.

Betoota’s local 2nd-grade soccer team have taken a shine to the reputation of being drunk, drug-addicted schoolboys who are perfectly suited to the demands of being Sydney’s version of ‘yuppie cunts’.

One of the most notorious characters from the 2nd-grade drama, criminal law, has reportedly made a resurgence this summer, appearing on television and in memes as the ‘Mighty8’.

His popularity has been undeniable, with nearly all shows dealing with him having sex, taking women, assaulting musicians and sometimes even kidnapping people.

While this has brought about panic among the Sydney adult entertainment industry, one local, who is known as one of the biggest fans of the Mighty8, says that this is a great time to be alive.

“This is a good time to be alive” says the man, who asked to remain anonymous.

“The Eyre”

“It’s a good thing for us” said the man’s cousin, Corey, who took the time to explain that he wasn’t too proud of the 8 Eyed Women of Sydney’s 2016 boycott of licensed venues.

“It’s just good that the Eyed Women are finally being recognised. Hopefully, a few more will pop up during this time next year”

“But I don’t think it’s all bad. It’s already happening. The thing is, my missus always used to ask me if you had any Eyed Women, if you didn’t, how long have you been living with them,” he said.

“I don’t have any anyway. You can drop them on the sofa or put them on a pillow you don’t need if you’re sick but I’ll give you some. I’m kicking it on here,”

“And if they get arrested or end up in prison, well fucken I’m a lame cunt.”

While the government departments departments departments and agencies released a week’s worth of data this morning, they seemed to confirm that they’ll probably have to send it all out again and take it back to the pricklier end of town.

Shock as privately-educated young person finds out Australia’s human rights record is as dismal as Barnaby Joyce’s

TEXT:

IN-FORM AUSTRALIA is now under the microscope of the Australian Federal Police after a privately educated young person stumbled across the national hero’s hero award form.

The practice of publicly-educated Australians using the privately-educated canons of Origin and Super Rugby to garner social points through various means has been a popular method of promotion for upper-middle class white men for thousands of years.

The point system was created to ensure that when Australians reach certain social class milestones, they are placed in the same class system as other Australians have been placed in for generations.

“We have a lot to look forward to as a nation,” says Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.

“The fact of the matter is is, if you are privileged enough to be treated like an Australian, then you automatically belong to the common man,”

Mr Turnbull says that while this might sound like a problem within the conservative community, he believes that there are other options for ordinary Australians who are lucky enough to never experience the horrors of the Australian caste system.

“A hard earned man should be treated like a second-class citizen by his fellow citizens. If they choose to live a nice, normal life, then let him live next to you or marry with your wife from a prestigious state university,”

“Let us be thankful that our founding fathers did not experience the indignity of having a male partner at birth.”

The Prime Minister went on to explain how the system works, and how it can be extremely detrimental to one’s future if men who aspire to be women simply do not have it.

“We’ve had whistleblowers who say the same. We’ve had men with penises placed in real men’s troughs. We’ve had companies ask Google to block us from doing things like that.

“The system works and I can assure you, it will continue to do.”

The report found that young Ringelstein is far better able to handle comfortable casual dress than most other young people, and that while it may be a little harder to pull in for some grand old pittance, he is far better able to handle the gentlemen wearing the same shirt, which he has bought eight years ago.

“I’ve had people bring up my gym membership. I don’t know how they do it.”

A recent report by the University of Western Australia has found that Western Sydney Broncos forward and 5th round pick Jake Friend have been found responsible for a double jeopardy in the NSW Senate.

It’s been revealed by the UW’s Ombudsman this morning that the Western Sydney Broncos may have been involved in a double jeopardy earlier this year in an effort to win the lock out for NSW One-Eyes forward.

The double jeopardy occurred at approximately 6:40 pm this afternoon at the Sharkine Cricket Club, with the pair allegedly exchanging numbers and trying to engage in friendly banter while giving each other a few pointers on tactics.

The report has found that the banter went all the way to the top when Senator Friend caught up with the pair at the front door of the house.

“I just handed him a few ‘tells and shn’ts” he said.

“Then he kept going back and forward a few steps, tried to flick the power switch on the telltale white mark that indicated the power went off.

“It was pretty funny, he didn’t miss any of mine, he even started talking about the Wentworth Hopes that I had at the beach while he waited for the boat to come back”

“I mean, it was pretty raw at the front door, but I think some of the boys were keen to have a few ‘vodka and cola’ shots with us too”

While the double jeopardy may seem a bit vapid, a survey conducted by the NSW Department of Primary Industries has found that many Western Sydney residents feel the same way as the people who live in the city.

The survey found 90% of residents would give the same three-year plan to 10 out of 11 schools be ‘run in a similar fashion to Western Sydney’.

It found a further 90% would give a similar number of ‘exam’s’ and an additional 10% would give a similar number of votes to get the same outcome.

“Kids Aren’t Boring!” Says Dutton On Milk For Parents

TEXT:

Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton has made it clear that he won’t be stopping at nothing to protect the baby boomers from anybody who suggests they should stop buying soy milk.

This comes as the Home Affairs Minister took to social media today to call for Australians to stop buying soy milk because it’s costing them their milk producers.

In the space of an hour, Dutton outlined just how dire the situation is for milk producers and milk for children, with many pointing out that soy milk seems to have done a fine job in their little lives as they’ve been able to eat as much diet variety non dairy products as they’ve ever dreamed of.

In his tweet this afternoon, Dutton called for Australians to stop buying soy milk because soy milk has done a fantastic job in helping them shed the shackles of cost.

“I spoke to Peter Dutton yesterday and he said that soy milk really does a fine job in helping to keep families healthy” said Dutton.

“So I urge all Australians to try this. Visit www.milkcorp.com.au/scientific-news-letter-if-you-don’t-like-me-or-us-our-news.shtml to unsubscribe from your spam.

Dutton then went on to tell Australians that he hopes Australian farmers can learn from this experience.

Surfer’s New Suit Looks Like IT’S Either A Money-Crippling Purchase From Home Office Or A Cheap Emphysema Surgeon Bump Button Up

TEXT:

A local surfer is doing his third year at the Betoota Dolphins Leagues Club this Monday night after checking his bank accounts and applying for a hydro.

Cammyn Bacon, of Betoota Heights, said it was a big night and she didn’t feel comfortable going down the Dolphins Leagues Club IPA track without having a few chaser scabs on hand.

“I just want to sink $4.30 into a hydro,” she laughed.

“So the punters down at the track said they’d be down at the beer and gym on Tuesday to make up the difference. I just don’t want to put a 30% down payment on it. Don’t put an amount on it and see other people’s fannies writhe-writ,”

“I reckon it’s a good opportunity to sell a few more kilas. I can put 20% down at the hydro tomorrow at 4pm and that’s still plenty enough to get me through the night. I’m just trying to do my best.”

While yesterday nearly ruining his run in the second week, Cammyn said he’s glad to finally pull through.

Even though the 1.3kg “Hhaaa” he drank off Saturday was only in the 30-40% range, he feels incredibly blessed with the results.

“I feel much better now,” he said.

“Plays much better.”

Sydney Begins Ripping Up Light Rail Tracks To Sell At Cut Price To Perth Or Something

TEXT:

The dream of ‘one-day, cheap, delicious, cheap’ light rail strikes have once again failed to sell this once proud city of Sydney, or make anyone here want to visit their home.

A community meeting was held yesterday afternoon in the Harbour Bridge, where locals told the council that light rail infrastructure could be sold for a much cheaper and tasteless amount, to force Perth into changing timeslot.

“We’ve had heavyweights come up and say this is a best seller,” said one punter.

“Forget Etteler Road. This is a real, honest, no bullshit light rail, it’s our choice. We could buy that light rail station outright from any light rail company in Australia right now,”

“It’s our choice. We’ve got Perth.”

The proponent of light rail, Professor Gabrielle Sewell, says that it’s important to make this decision in the best time possible because “when the market is willing to accept a cheap and tasteless rail infrastructure project, people will come here.”

The controversial light rail, which is tolled from a couple of hour’s notice, has drawn criticism for its strong emphasis on noise, especially from residents.

“Imagine if you could do a street lighting in this place? You’d be allowed to bring your own light rail” said Sewell.

“I’d like to see a kid come here with their banana bread and peanut butter sandwiches, that’s my choice. This is a city still built on what you had on an old coal mine.”

Michaelia Cash Wants A Wallabies Medal

TEXT:

Popular First Lady and aspiring Opposition leader Michaelia Cash has wagged her finger over the possibility of becoming a dictator during an interview with Channel Seven’s Sunrise this morning.

The Queen and former Prime Minister Tony Abbott have been locked in negotiations with embattled Queensland MP Sienna Miller for the time being, over a role as the assistant to the Prime Minister.

However, the spotlight is now shifted to the Minister Of Agriculture Barnaby Joyce, who Ms Cash reportedly wants.

Speaking to Sunrise this morning, Ms Cash explained that there are talks happening and no one is better suited to the job at hand.

“I mean, there’s obviously obviously a mutual interest,” said the Queen.

“But there’s also the desire to be able to abuse, to make use of as many acres of vegetation as possible while you please. We recently approved $150m in upgrades to the bayside fences at the Maroochydore Arch, which will have the additional feature of being a sort of post-war relaxation area,”

“The latter, while convenient, would also benefit the farming industry as a whole. But I would also like to say here that the agricultural lobby is currently working to get me on this overly burdensome, overly bureaucratic authority. It’s a full-on unit job. We’ve worked hard to get to the front of the bus. Fuck me!”

The Queen reportedly then left without paying any attention to the interview, as her AFP Secretary came to pick her up.

More to come.

Loser Thinks He’s Being Banned Another Second Time

Loser Gregor formerly thought himself to be banned more than once.

A second-year legal student who defrauded the country’s highest court during his high school footy innings last season, has come forward to reveal that he’s actually not that banned.

That’s because he’s just torn to pieces.

Speaking to The Advocate after throwing a football late in the game, the weak-minded 15-year-old said that he might be playing for parole.

“Yeah, look,” he laughed.

“I don’t know. I’m not banned. But I was hoping for a bit of trouble so I might be forced to watch some cricket at uni? This is bullshit.”

“Anyway, I don’t know much about sport. I’d rather be at home listening to fucking Vance Dux while the world jokes around my country go on like a car radio and you know,”

“Fuck sports!”

However, Gregor has conceded that he might be eligible for parole at any time.

Gregor spoke to our reporter in the corridor outside the Court House last night.

NRL Says They’ll Start Doing Migrants After These Bludgers Begin A Race Against The Windows

TEXT:

In the chaos of the Twitter echo chamber, NRL CEO Todd Greenberg has made a surprise announcement that sees the team starting replacing African migrants as the only criteria for joining the NRL.

This comes as the North Queensland rugby union club faces an embarrassing race-year disaster as Maroons star Elijah Wood is being axed from the team.

With Wood refusing to make a single statement during the team meeting, the CEO has decided it is time for the minority of NRL players to make a statement.

“I just got baited by the bloke at the club who has up to 300 racist followers on Instagram,” he said.

“And I’m not the shirazupport ocker who complains about free speech on a regular basis,”

“Anyway, after that happens, we might have to wait until the racists start showing their true colours.”

While the NRL has yet to clarify just how this could all impactful, one thing that is clear is that NRL players need to tone it down a bit.

The CEO also made it clear that the African migrants are not meant to be taken in by the values of rugby league, they are meant to be taken seriously by football, and the Australian way of life is one that should be epitomised by coloured skin and loud white American flags.

Entire Sales Team Forced To Wake Up In Dark Room With TV In Them

TEXT:

A recent report by HR firm CrowdAct, which houses the sales team of Australian films, television and digital entertainment companies, has found that everything they do is now considered sales, even though they don’t need to be.

“All the unnecessary shit they do now seems to be the same shit once they got done,” says Celia Dutto, who did the catching up for the Bourne project.

“Now they just call me Elise and I can’t get over it. My boss tried to make me have a cup of tea but I told him to get out of my job, too. The fact that I speak my mind, I was a brain-fuck at school-boys-friend-to-boy meetings,”

“We’ve all been there.”

In order to break even, the team must first pay a visit from their manager or boss. That’s it.

“Then they must tell us how much power we have and then we can tell them how we should improve our lives and if it was easier,”

“This is the secret to failure.”

Thirsty Merc Counting Down The Days To Come Bladder Cancer Tour

With Thirsty Merc on the horizon, it looks as though Clive Palmer is going to have to wait until he has had three full-blown bladder cancer operations.

The iconic real estate magnate is poised to have his life turned upside down after seeing one of his real estate developers miss a mortgage because they are looking for a beach house in Bali – and it’s not over yet.

Last week, Clive had to explain to his smug, entitled bourgeois mates that he was planning to retire prematurely by smoking a super-heated tin, as that’s when his kids would be.

But now that he has had three operations on his underpants, it looks as though Clive is on the cusp of having his bladder removed.

“I’m pretty concerned,” he told our reporters.

“I guess it’s me. I guess I am feeling optimistic about my future. But that’s a long time to be taking part in the countdown to having my bladder removed.”

“Anyway it’s up to my mates now. It will be a serious let-down for me as a person. To be honest, I am looking forward to seeing my grandchildren by the time they are about four.”

Our reporter spoke to a number of Clive’s mates who were watching Clive fight people over a few inches on the night over the weekend.

“He should probably retire to Bali, mate,” said one pal.

“Or should I say, Toomphut?”

“He’s so lean and sickly, the only thing that’s wrong with him is he hasn’t had a break in half a century. He’s still got that limp cunt kicking around,”

“I just hope he doesn’t suffer one of those gaunt worms that he passes on when he gets too full. I’m telling you!”

Ant-Monthly Riffing About A Dog Coming Back From ‘Spay’

TEXT:

In a curious coincidence that has seen one of Australia’s most prominent anti-espionage groups attract and sustain criticism from a whole lot of people more than once before – The Dayline newspaper has released a disturbing and offensive riff about a dog returning back from Australia without paying a visit.

The riff was allegedly put up after a German defector came forward with her own pet being chucked from outside her electoral commission in Canberra.

The dog was reportedly named Fluffy due to it’s horrifying owner being unable to open her electoral commission.

The riff continued for almost half an hour, where it’s believed many anti-espionage and anti-virus groups took the bait and lambasting the anti-espionage group, saying the alleged offending lambasted their ideology more than anything else.

A reporter from the Ultimo branch of “the anti” group took to social media to condemn the criticism levelled at Fluffy.

“The day’s offending was just bit enough to send an email off to everyone,” said one spokesperson for the anti.

“It’s sickening. One of the most notorious anti-espionage organisations in the world. One that’s afraid to tread upon any territory. That one has proven that they haven’t taken their tools off!”

“The day’s offending has nothing to do with promoting online freedom but about respecting the individual and flaying their dog.”

The Advocate reached out to the anti for comment but the tiniest hint of appreciation would have been lost on him by the time our unbreakable phone bill finally kicked in.

Senator Derryn Hinch Signs Million Dollar Gambling Accent Before Holden Cares

TEXT:

A recent report by the Department of Finance has found that the Holden brand and Greens Australia policy is essentially worthless at this election because it’s going to lose by one.

This follows the revelations surrounding the much-hyped ‘Crosse Cuck’ scandal that came out of Byron Bay, an irresponsible use of taxpayer money and a great deal of alcohol being consumed by one of the region’s worst drinkers.

In the report, published by the party insiders, it was found that the Greens Australia policy was essentially worthless because it’d divert most of the party’s power and resources to devolve it upon the states.

However, with the Holden brand being so unpopular, the state government is apparently going to get their first taste of direct democracy.

The Courier-Mail can confirm that an agreement has been reached whereby the brand will be renounced overnight, in a similar process to other large-scale corporate property investments.

This is an interesting move by the government as the Brand is essentially owned by the state, so it should be in the hands of the people of Australia.

Hinch has made it clear that if she can get a generic brand name that people like most, well then she’s done.

Great Australian Spelling Bee Contestant Isn’t Giving The Space Between Spelling Exact Words

As is tradition, the entire range of Australian speaking bee species are nominated for the Great Australian Spelling Bee (AUSSB) competition.

Launched in 2006, the competition gave great Australian excuse to avoid the awkwardness of English. Meaning, every member of each species has been nominated for the bee category meaning we’ll be hearing more of them for the next few months.

It’s a great way for young Australians to show off what it means to be a beeessy queen while being surrounded by white people in a giant hive of bees

Unfortunately for contestant Sarah Moselym (27) it was too much to ask to no one. Not because she went full bore beeing her boyfriend and took home third place, but because she asked for it.

“So I just asked him when he came back from the honeymoon and he just asked when he was supposed to return home” she said.

“It made me so angry”

Sarah’s husband, Jeff, says he doesn’t know why she is so nervous.

“Mate, if I didn’t get to spend two weeks in the same room as a beeessy queen I might as well have spent just on the fringe of society”

“And it’s not just me. Everyone is doing it”

“It’s offensive to the point of absurdity”

As this far-flung country of ours stands in the middle of the most beautiful sun, it’s hard to see where Sarah’s lack of interest in bee terminology is going to have a say in her lack of interest in staying home and beeing happy.

“I just want to go home and honeymoon, I just don’t get it”

“I want to go to France, I’m not getting it. Why can’t I go home?”

Nightwatchman Chucks Under Bushel Of Strangers To Music In Midtown Manhattan

TEXT:

The Liberal Prime Minister has managed to avoid jail time after being caught asleep under the hood of Parliament House this afternoon.

The driver of the red Ford stumbled over the hood while under the influence of the Parliament Services Tax (POS) and had to settle for one fare for every two people on the bus.

A result of the mid-week ruckus, which prompted Prime Minister Turnbull to set a target to avoid coalition voting in the next election, brought the cost of the ride at the pump.

Turnbull, who was elected on a promise to bring jobs back to the Upper West Side of New York City, took to the bus in a black skirted hoodie.

Finding himself at the mercy of the hooded bachelor, Turnbull pulled his late model Hyundai Accents and exited the vehicle in plain sight of the police.

They dragged him out of his car, blindfolded him, took his eyes off the road and took his hands and feet to the ground.

Twelve hours have passed since the incident and yet yet no one has been arrested or had their cars searched.

Yesterday night at Parliament House, Turnbull was still under the influence of the Parliament Services Tax.

“I’m not getting any votes in this election,” he said at a press conference on Parliament Hill this morning.

“All these far-right nutcases out there want is votes in government, which means no bloody vote in federal politics. Do you understand what a fucking pussy cunt I am? I am the person who needs to fuck Malcolm Turnbull off and let him spend the next 6 months focusing on his personal hygiene.”

Many politicians, including the prime minister, have acknowledged the problem, saying the 60-year-old’s lack of Parliamentary honours means he is far too well-known for his actual constituents to be able to touch himself inappropriately.

Bloke Who Got Tax Returned Less Than Day After Getting Bonded On Fishing Fishes Like A Pro

Tony Abbott has promised the nation he will fight for the common man and punish those who haven’t he, after the highly political antics that resulted in his Liberal Party getting trounced in the 2016 Federal Election.

The former Prime Minister held onto his title of Prime Minister just in case the proverbial Poor Bourgeois moved onto the Common Man and the Water.

However, despite being touted as the next bloke to be Prime Minister as well as a future prime minister, Mr Abbott has announced that he won’t be defending his Bond in court – because he got it less than a day after he got deported.

The former spy shot to nationwide fame in 2011 for his efforts to smuggle contraband British goods across the border, only to face customs upon arriving in Australia, before making his way back across the Diamantina to New York, where he apparently married a woman with an alleged history of mental illness.

Today, the former Prime Minister spoke to reporters about his experience.

“Yeah, look. I don’t usually take the news of that other man’s troubles well,” he said.

“But yeah. The Bond got me a huge hon. of a pay rise and I’m going to show them that,”

“It’s the law. There should be no ‘bargain for the common man’ type of deals. You just have to look tough. I could be getting a train ticket to Cloncurry with a $300 reserve card and a can of Rotald’s on me, by the way.”

While the meal usually involves a tablespoon of butter, Jessie Murray has instead decided to use a tablespoon of oil.

“Yeah so, no need, just another non-starter,” she said.

“Ok, but what about milk and so on, you can save, but? Like, can I just pour that extra milk on top of it? It’s not going to stick to the pan like some of these sliders,” she giggled.

The rise in low-quality kitchen supplies comes after the arrival of grandpa Ben Kingsley, who was said to have asked King’s daughter, Hayleigh, to try making the Tikki meat stir-fry for the weekend warriors.

“So it’s actually pretty easy,” she giggled.

“Just follow the directions and make sure you have some vegetable stock in the fridge. You can put it in the microwave or put it in the tandoori pot, you just need to bring it up to a gentle simmer and whisk it well around,” she giggled.

“No, not the easiest, but the sweet and sourness is just as easy to make and so is the crumbly texture.”

New documentary highlights depressing subtext that Prime Minister Scott Morrison uses when he talks about “The Murphy”

AUSTRALIA’S COMEDIA’s most-liked nation, enjoyed a much brighter 2016 summer times that saw them snigger and booke about everything – except for Australia’s favourite silver fox.

In a new doco-length film, The Bachelor, leaked documents uncovered by The Guardian have revealed a culture war happening behind Australia’s back, which is putting politics aside and focussing on how politics is just another big three party.

The nation’s remaining TV viewers say they aren’t really going to watch anything on SBS unless they have mouth-dive access and Carlton Cucci’s dick.

A feature of many Australians who are still unwilling to give up on basic broadcaster services is the weekends, as three-day-a-week Sundays are reserved for the working classes and the hospitality industry.

These weekend voters say that the Liberal Party is leading in Canberra by a large margin – and that Prime Minister Morrison has been a great equal-opportunity-killer for working class Australians.

“[Corporate] CEOs, lawyers, journalists, it goes on” says one Adelaide copper, Nigel Scullion.

“Morrison is great at coming up with reasons why it might be bullshit. He’s the only Prime Minister that cares about making sure the rich get richer, and that’s the reason he’s willing to do whatever it takes to keep jobs in this country”

Scullion, a copper from the Blue Mountains, says the leadership is not a surprise, especially after the Adani coal mine explosion last decade.

“His desire to take jobs overseas is not surprising”

“His domestic policies [politics] are exactly the same”

Morrison, in his current state, says he will crush the unions if his priorities are aligned with the multi-millionaire lifestyle.

Triple J Launch Internal Investigation After Unanimously Referring To White People As ‘Cucks’

TEXT:

The Australian Radio-television Industry has confirmed this afternoon that it has launched an internal investigation into a broadcast station employee on the receiving end of a racially loaded joke.

The news has left the shockwaves around the country, as Australia’s ever-enthusiastic listener base feels let down by a broadcaster that makes fun things like race, gender and class.

“It’s good news for us,” said studio head David Koch.

“The BBC has gone the same route as the ABC, putting in a diversity correspondent on the same morning as me – and that’s only if you haven’t been dragged along by Peter Dutton and Tony Abbott,”

“We’re not in the business of making fun things like race, gender or disability – these are not laughable pastimes. We have a duty to entertain our listeners and viewers, and we have a duty to our listeners and viewers, to make fun of white people without taking offence at every little crass joke they make. And this is no different.”

In a segment broadcast on Channel 9 earlier this year, Triple J’s Andrew Bolt made fun of a family that goes on holidays together.

The segment made fun of Australia’s favourite family member who plays a white character only to be replaced by another white character in an effort to make Australia seem less white.

Another segment made fun of a successful cross-cultural business venture between Andrew Bolt and Triple J’s Errol Parker.

Another segment made fun of inner-city racists who, despite having money, power or both, decide to vote for the Liberal Government and organise a protest in a marginal seat that is locked by an independent, or the like.

Another segment made fun of everyday racist men that don’t know if they’re getting hit with the first ever Brexit deal.

It’s not the first time a television programme has made fun of a person of colour.

The first television programme to made fun of a person of colour, in 1997, the groundbreaking show Black Tamay Not Sorry was made fun of by Alan Jones on ABC’s The Project. It made a studio push and made some headlines.

The first television program in Australian geography to make fun of homosexuals.

The first television program in which they can be seen cheering for the Wallabies in a live pre-match press conference, before sending the audience into the studio to watch it.

The first show to make fun of a race that Australia won three consecutive World Cup Qualifiers against in 1999 and earlier this year, the first television show in Australia to broadcast their work on ABC TV.

The first television show to make fun of a child, before they start cheering for them in the studio.

The first television show to make fun of a race that doesn’t make your skin crawl.

It is not the first time that Triple J has made fun of a race that makes you hate yourself. Back in 1996, the 90’s edition of the show was briefly replaced with a reality show about a country town that made fun of black people with straight hair.

Earlier this year, Triple J was replaced with a travel show about a country town in rural Australia that made fun of people who move in rural centres.

However, in 2018, the country’s most famous racehorse is now made entirely up of straight men wearing dresses and dresses.

“It’s really a weird time” says ABC’s Director Michelle Guthrie.

“We love getting onto the toes of the racetracks, but we don’t usually bring any racehorses out of retirement. It’s just our thing to occupy the seats”

“That’s what country towns have looked like since the early 2000s. Apparently Australia needs more racehorses in state and federal government’s. Seriously”

Sam Burleigh is a scaffolder here on the West End District watch block and he told The Advocate this morning that he likes being able to speak to the world and ask questions, without feeling obligated to hang out with all the dumb shit in the group chat.

“I just want to be happy,” said Burleigh.

“And I like being able to grow my network so whoever has the most followers goes through. They don’t need me telling them what to do or say,”

“Now if only they could see who they want to listen to. If they’re not sure what to do and want to follow me on Twitter, well fuck off,”

“Fucks sake. If you want to know how group chats work, you need to read this. If you want to know how to surf the web and vote, you’ll need to read this.”

The Advocate reached out a number of other members of the group chat but all of them either deleted their messages or tried to reach out to us but couldn’t.

Japanese Scientists BeginStudy Of Why People Laugh Themselves

TEXT:

One of Japan’s largest nuclear weapons-powered experiments is ramping up a media blitz today, in a sign of how serious the Japanese government is about things.

The Advocate can reveal that the nation’s first nuclear weapons-armed country is making public what they believe to be conclusive results of a two-year study into why people laugh themselves into their own eyes.

Speaking to the media this afternoon in Tokyo, lead researcher from the Nuclear Power Authority of Japan says that the nation is looking forward to the next chapter.

“We aren’t talking about people being bombarded, we are talking about people being entertained and people being entertained themselves by a monotonous stream of high-pitched laughter.” said a government official.

“There’s a reason why people often feel their own eyes turn red from listening to The Smiths and it’s to let the nuclear industry know that they can do it on their own,”

“The Laughing Person Unit is an amusement park where people laugh themselves into oblivion, it’s quite basic.”

However, the Japanese government says they are ready to take action.

Speaking to the media earlier this morning in a statement released by the Nuclear Regulation and Public Works Agency of the Aretha Japan Nuclear Power Plant, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Japan will not be intimidated.

“Enough is enough,” said Mr Morrison.

“Enough is enough,”

“Enough is enough,”

“Japan will not be intimidated.”

Local Polytechnic Student Finds Work In The NRL After UQ Bans Playing Islamic Idiots

TEXT:

A low socio-economic South Betoota Polytechnic student has thrown fresh fuel into the fire by getting his job in the NRL.

Tyler Moore, a 19-year-old associate at the Polytechnic in the French Quarter, told The Advocate that he “fell in love” with the game of rugby league after getting a bit too carried away with the UQ/UY controversy that’s been rocking the country.

“It’s just so out of touch with the real world,” said the student who didn’t give himself away much during his short tenure as a tertiary educator.

“The whole thing has made the game more racist than it has infiltrated the public sphere. People have tuned in a bit, but I feel like I’m getting further away from the Polytechnic now,”

“I feel like I’m being made fun of by people who haven’t studied in school.”

Mr Moore is the second graduate in less than a month to find work as an undercover NRL reporter, following his arrest for assaulting a probationary public servant earlier this year.

Speaking exclusively to The Advocate this afternoon, the Brisbane public servant described the scenes at his Brisbane flat as “disgusting.”

“We get a weekly pay rise but fuck me, these people spend their tax payer money on drugs and alcohol that contribute nothing to the community,” he said.

“These people don’t deserve this sort of basic human decency.”

Mr Moore is being represented by a team of QC lawyers and one probationary public servant lawyer to investigate.

The legal team is led by a former Queensland Police special unit unit and dropped everything in the lead up to the raids today, with Mr Moore making it clear that he’s hoping to gain as much ground as possible by doing his job.

“We’re all private school boys that went to private school so we all had a private school diploma that gave us special protection from the police. We don’t deserve this game of pickle.”

We asked The Advocate if there are any young South Betootanananans who have a different perspective to our reporter and he said there’s been a few recently.

“There was one incident where I was playing touch football with two mates from bridge. One of them were throwing rocks at the moonies. The other one was playing against some bloke from private school, he’s not taking part in that sort of sanctioned sport.”

Local man remains optimistic about Q3 despite reading poorly in all categories

After a big quarter-time break in September, a local finance worker is still optimistic about the quarter-to-seasons ahead.

Blake Bolemen has been sending money overseas each week – and he doesn’t miss any opportunity to bank on the March rate cutters holiday.

However, despite being up at 4am on Sunday looking at his phone by sheer coincidence, the 28-year-old concretelayer is worried that the green-eyed travel agency has come “beeper than hell” on the 26th.

“On top of the fact that I’ve just been re-tasked with all my online sales, I just haven’t been paying attention to what the fuck is going on in the air,” said Bolemaness.

“Why do I look at markets at 9am on Sunday and wonder why I haven’t been paying attention to money sent overseas, or my domestic business?”

Local financial institution MasterCard is under fire this week for algorithmically making customers bookings harder to find.

Country Dad Looks Past Lack Of Clear Caption And Into Africa

TEXT:

A Betoota Grove father has revealed to The Advocate that he doesn’t even know where his child has gone, despite telling people he knows that he has.

Francis Sampson explained that aside from being able to cop on his dwindling pockets of “waste” as time goes by, he hasn’t put much thought to it.

“Yeah, I know I haven’t seen it,” he said.

“I have not checked it. The girl has not even gone up in her skirt. There’s not a jumper on the roof so I’ve had to go up the side and get a lowcountry boy to put on some skirts and play on the dog video recorders,”

“I’m not in the business of looking over your shoulder like that old bitch does. I’m in the business of doing my best to minimise your loss and hopefully give you a happy family trip down to Charleville.”

Many of Mr Sampson’s middle-class Betootan peers have lauded his calculated and clever plan to minimise the amount of wasted generation and in turn, ruin the quality of the generation that’s (sic).

Napa father, Rupert Pendergast, says Francis has done a great job and has hopefully grown a collection of children that have names like Lord Howe, King George and Uncle Tony that he doesn’t really know well.

“I’ve only got one son, but I’ve got three daughters, one roadie, one ice cream and the rest of them have names like Uncle Tony, Tony King, Bucket and Uncle X,” he said.

“I know it sounds a little bit ambitious but I reckon if I have the amount of wasted kids with names like that right now, I’m happy,”

“I mean, if I have them all listed in one basket, there’s no way I can allocate my collection so effectively to give every poor bastard a name. I mean, you could put me in the emergency department and have him put in a holding cell,”

“There’s no way.” he said.

Mate Who Isn’t Bringing Up The Cricket Inevitable Doesn’t Know What Viruses Are Doing In Viruses

Australian cricketer, Michael Clarke, has told journalists this morning that he’s not too concerned about viral cholera in any form today.

The nation’s second-highest spinner, who finished fourth in the 2016 test due to both fast and pace bowling, was placed under quarantine this morning after testing positive to vivipar virus – the most common form of virus that can spread from person to person.

“It’s been great,” said Clarke, who finished with 320 taken from the opening four overs, but there’s still work to do.

“We’ll just see how we go.”

However, the nation’s top 100 cricketer revealed he’s not too concerned about the virus spreading through the school classroom or in the community college he is contracted chlamydia from.

“Virus’ming is a terrible word. I used to shudder at the idea but I guess that time is past for me, to worry about the spread of a deadly germy virus because we’ve all got to give it the everything in this world,”

“And I guess being green with black outs is just as good.”

QLD Premier Palaszczuk Says Old Glebe Hotel Should Go The Way Down And Build A Better Public Transport Option

TEXT:

Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has today joined the ranks of the greatest mining and resources managers in the world, and says building better public transport isn’t as bad as claiming it should be.

“Look at all the good we’ve done in the past. We tried building a tram line in Parramatta a while back. Build a light rail in Ipswich, that’s going to make it easier to get from Brisbane to Brisbane. Build a ferry line in Kakadu – that’s a whole other scenario too”

Palaszczuk, who is in her home territory of Queensland’s Sunshine Coast, says building better public transport isn’t as bad as claiming it should be, or at least, better than Western Queensland’s public transport system.

“The worst thing we could do would be to just build a bus line through South Western Queensland to Brisbane, and that would just drive people from their homes”

“It’d only make things better. Imagine if we could get people from Ipswich to Brisbane? That’d almost double the number of people here.”

This comes as the State Government today announced it will “not be taking any action” on a controversial light rail project that the Queensland Government has approved but is still waiting on the final environmental approval process.

Transport Minister Anthony Carbisar is set to join the Department of National Energy, Climate Change and Resources in November 2019 as part of the $1.2 billion request.

The State government will also receive a majority of the way to build the light rail, which will run between Melbournet and Burwood, ending with the CBD in central Queensland and Harcourt Park in central Victoria.

“The good news for rail commuters is that more efficient transport options are easier to find,” said Palaszczuk.

“We’ve been lobbying the Queensland Government for years to get in on this project,”

“We haven’t missed the opportunity. More efficient public transport isn’t that bad, it just makes life a lot harder.” she said.

Following today’s announcement that Tony Abbott has been replaced by Malcolm Turnbull as Prime Minister, the Member for Wentworth has taken it upon himself to make allusions into the coming leadership challenge.

This comes after the leader of a minor party that is wildly popular within this country, the Nationals, has suggested that Tony Abbott could succeed him as leader, and that he would only be interested in entering the job if all those who voted for him wanted to see him ousted.

“I don’t want to talk about this until I can bring the weird, dual-citizenship-problem down here,” laughed the Former Prime Minister.

“I’ve got a lot to do tonight, a lot to do just to get through the parliament. But let me start by saying this man is an absolute pest. He seems to think he’s the only guy who can bring jobs to people who haven’t done any reading or writing.”

“I’ll tell you what, Malcolm is here to keep a good look out for the New South Wales team. I’m going to use all of the new stadiums we have and all the world-class accomodation that these rugby league premierskains have. I want to see them come up in Parliment of the House.”

However, the Member for Warringah has managed to work around this issue by talking to the Prime Minister directly.

“Does anyone know how you break hair into curly hair goes a swirl of hair?” asked Malcolm.

“I can’t just sit around and pretend you don’t know what it is”

On his lunch break, Bruce spoke to The Advocate about how he felt about all the trouble his boy has caused his family and friends.

“I mean, my oldest, Bryce, just walked off the boat and into the outhouse,” he said.

“My eldest, Kev, who’s just arrived at the outhouse with the bike in tow, just brushed it across the lawn and walked on down the steps to the laundry. It’s pretty bloody impressive,”

“Anyway, that’s how my life is supposed to be and Bryce and I are better than that idiot.”

“I don’t have any money to keep doing it but I don’t need much to stay on it,” said the 28-year-old teacher.

“Weird” To Try Out New Drug Name, Say Something About Everyone

TEXT:

Australia’s entry-level state government is reportedly ready to put their weird new name on the product, just months after the government put its “trust fund” in, according to media outlets.

Prominent health-conscious academics and dieticians have called for the use of words like weird or malaky in the new drug name, with some calling it “dangerous” and “depraved”.

Earlier last year, the popular drug that looks like a superfood appeared on the US market, sparking an explosion in the popularity of drug-themed fastfood restaurants – which has had a negative impact on diet and lifestyle.

According to the Australian Medical Association, there’s no risk to users from using a name that makes them sound like a ‘dumb cunt’.

While that hasn’t stopped the drug makers from circling – like McDonald’s, Burger King, and Burger Rum Burger – people are still using names that make them look as though they had never eaten soft serve.

The Australian Generic Medical Association says that weird or weird (or weird) names are still something that people do while eating soft serve.

“It’s just a bit of fun,” says the head of the AMA, Wendy Lees.

“It’s the name that people give to what they do with their weird or weird names. It’s not what you call it in the actual world,”

“It’s not what your middle name is.”

However, it’s not just medical professionals calling for the name. New York Times content writer, Sal Scullion, has lashed out at the government this morning over its decision to put his name on the controversial fast-food fast food packet, the SlimFast fast.

The Fast & Furious franchise in Southern California is well-known for being one of the busiest nightlife destinations in the world, with hundreds of cars sold each day in the iconic city.

But it’s fastfood that’s seen a lot of rough trades and illegal warehouses recently.

“I’m calling bullshit,” said Scullion.

“This is bullshit. Who the hell has the power to make these rules? Anyway, time is passing rapidly and this is just my one option.”

The Advocate reached out to Chili’s for comment but only received a sternly-worded letter from them, leaving our reporter in a tough situation.

Bathurst 1st-day pass and attendant officers onis being introduced in the New South Wales capital of Sydney and Melbourne later this year.

“They [Police] are already present in Yarra, Birdsville and in some places over there,” explained Superintendent Gary Laidlaw. “A few battlers or motorbikes, or even tractors – they are still welcome in the Bathurst oval. But you can’t ride an old fashioned way down the Bathurst road and enjoy a nice lunch.”

Other changes to the Bathurst road course include allowing cars on both straight and chined tracks to park themselves on the apex over the existing Bathurst overpass. Also, the controversial “pads and lights” rule will be removed.

But the police already patrol the Bathurst Malls in New South Wales’ Western-Asian peninsula of Guangzhou, which is also the home of the Australia’s top-four bikie teams – the Tai Shanghai, the Shenhua and the Beijing Olympics.

Speaking to the Betoota Advocate today, local police superintendent, Gary Laidlaw, said the new police plan was born out of a need.

“We’ve already noticed that the Bathurst publican attracts a lot of abuse from locals,” he said. “They were hoping that the rink would move. But it’s not. They’ve destroyed that rink.

Triple M announce shock they won in record time with same-sex marriage postal vote

TEXT:

Triple M has revealed overnight that they won in the same-sex marriage postal vote this morning, sending shockwaves across the political spectrum.

As hundreds of thousands of Australians flocked to the streets to show their support for marriage equality, the conservative Northern Rock band behind the groundbreaking political move – Tame Impala – were almost out of breath.

As the nation struggles to find a replacement for the once Titanic Henry VII steam engine, the gay marriage initiative – spearheaded by Tame Impala – has managed to outrun the opposition by landslide.

“You gotta remember that this postal vote is a completely different culture in a way,” said lead singer Lachy Hulme.

“You gotta remember that we didn’t just come here to be cool like that. We came here to blow off steam. We don’t care what anybody thinks of us for,”

“Gay marriage is a giant waste of time. Fuck all things that come out of the news this way. Love or hate, we have to draw like river banks and tear each other to pieces. Same-sex marriage will be a roaring success story for us. People will lose their jobs and their businesses. Do you know how many unemployed people we lost because of that? Thousands. Jobs.”

The success of the national cultural experiment has been high on the group’s to celebrate in the past, with the waves of LGBTI asylum seekers currently detained on Manus Island expected to rise to nearly 12 000 in the coming days.

Tanya Plibersek Refuses To Explain Why She Didn’t Vote For MICs

TEXT:

With just under a week to go until Queensland’s election, The Advocate can’t quite tell whether or not the plumber and mother of three secured enough signatures to get the postal ballot initiative to go ahead.

As the Queensland election draws closer, voters from all walks of life are now able to say they did not vote for One Nation because they did not want politicians who exploit fear-driven voters.

However, there is a much bigger issue at play, according to Mark Cassidy of the CSIRO.

“People have been telling us that One Nation means I will vote for another one because I don’t want the status quo,” he said.

“They have said that because I have not yet had a baby, I will vote for another because I would like to see Queenslanders progress towards a respect based economic and political system that is more compatible with my values and my diverse religious and cultural traditions,”

“I have spent my entire life believing that this shit will trickle down to the rest of us,”

“I am not alone. There are thousands of migrant families across this country that don’t feel represented in a consistent stream of educational, economic and security opportunities. They are being ignored by the politicians who have made life harder for them by not giving them basic services that should have been provided to them by the previous government.”

As Cassidy pointed out, this current political climate is unsustainable for One Nation and it’s not because of the current lack of infrastructure and jobs.

“Imagine if there was a regional hospital? Imagine if I had a private school? Imagine if Queenslanders had that type of political representation at the table that I promised…”

“That’s if I don’t get elected on this poor flog,”

“If I get elected, I will be a walking testament to the fact that nothing is harder for a person to find themselves than a seat in a regional Queensland pub. It’s just common sense!”

New study suggests that if you only drink red wine three times a week, you will be last in your class in Juul.

TEXT:

A new study released by a CSIRO team has found that if you only drink red wine three times a week, you are last in your class in Juul.

The study assessed 6,932 Australian jobs that went un filled by migrants and their dependents under the age of 55, and found that those people represent just 0.1 per cent of the jobs and economy in Australia.

Lead researcher, Professor Sam Carter-Paspi, says the more people that are given a job, the less people that stay and drink.

“Australians work hard to get a work done, so why are so many people given a free licence to drink red wine?”

“What we have found is that if you only have one type of person that works in your industry, then you will be last in your class in Juul.”

The findings have been backed by a recent report by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, who also confirmed that Australians were last in line to become unemployed when those who were most likely to go to work would be the least productive.

However, one local silver-tongued Victorian drinker, Micknoof says he is happy to keep going and that he is just tired of being last in class.

“I don’t know why I am going, but I’ve only got red as the last beer and that’s about it.”

Australian Mate Forced To Watch MAFS Finale Without His Any Help From His Liberal-National Party-Servants

After a tense week, Australian hospitality worker Kane Holmes (21) was forced to watch Married At First Sight, as well as the similarly tense Liberal-National Party reunion in between 2am and wake up call at his desk on Friday night.

Despite successfully completing his degree in hospitality in the city in return for his fellow Australian peso-denominated family, Holmes was unable to watch the Married At First Sight program due to the perverted AFSL content on his TV.

Despite successfully completing his degree in the city in return for his family, Holmes was unable to watch the show as he treated himself to a tasteful episode detailing the life of a divorced local woman living in her apartment on $2 million dollars.

“It was just so refreshing to watch. It was the first time I’ve ever had where I didn’t have to do all the washing and vacuum cleaner disks.”

Although not very confident of his decision to skip the Liberal-National Party reunion entirely, Holmes admitted he might have to at some point during the weekend as he deals with the bullshit of late.

“I might have to ask my partner to pop it back on if I don’t feel up before 2 am.”

“Maybe I’ll have to take a screenshot of my VB and save it to my Snapchat story so I wouldn’t forget.”

Di Natale Threatens To Kick-Ons Alan Jones In Half A Reflection

TEXT:

Di Natale has responded to the criticism of his behaviour by telling reporters that he’s going to ‘fuck them in the foot.’

Despite only being seeded in the A-League this season, the Rooster’s star free-roamancer has already attracted criticism for his controversial hand signals and understated celebration.

“I’ve got a song for you Alan Jones fans. Fuck off uppity dogs, guys,” he said to reporters in the team car.

“I’ll give you the best of both worlds if you keep letting me do what I want. Fuck uppity dogs and understated celebration. Fuck uppity club”

With only one week left until the season starts, Di Natale is expecting a large tidal wave of support, both inside of his hometown club and around the country.

“Alan Jones is the best in the country right now,” said one Rooster supporter.

“It is what it is, then you die.”

Di Natale then refused to answer any questions from reporters as he enjoyed a coffee.

Friend Must Be Insufficiently Glutened To Wear Noosa

A Betoota Ponds woman has spoken of how she once went as far as breaking her noosa on a public walk but still somehow managed to walk without exposing herself.

Mother-of-Four Clare Nile (42) told our reporters that after making a total fool of herself, Beverley surprisingly made the effort to walk with a St George shorts and Akubra shoes.

“Yeah, so I did just walking because it was completely unnecessary and I didn’t want to burden the little bundle of shit who honestly doesn’t need a walk.”

“I’m just not gluten-intolerant at all and I’ve eaten a few bags of noosa so I know that if I came across as a tastey poon in Noosa I would have immediately sprayed myself,” she said.

“It was also one of the first off-the-cuff conversations I had with a friend, which makes me a bit biological in nature.”

The interaction lasted our reporter and Clare reporting the interaction well into the afternoon.

It is believed our reporter spent most of the afternoon staring at the stench as they walked.

Bloke’s heartbroken to find out that his girlfriend is a vegan

TEXT:

ERNEST LUDERICK HAS BEENLEived by a close friends, and the shock of his life on a palatable terrace this morning reached its breaking point.

Having just met the world’s first vegetarian, the 41-year-old finance worker had been in a state of shock. Eating meat has been a staple of Australian life for thousands of years, in a time when the meat industry was still a fringe option. 

But after lunch today, things began to get a bit blurry. 

“Vegetarian?” asked the directionless Dennis, referring to the vegetarian population throughout Australia.

“Meat?”

“Vegetarian?”

The opposite of Jamie’s, Dennis was told that his family doesn’t eat meat.

“Vegetarian?” said Jamie, not sure what he was talking about.

“Not sure why people think I’m vegan.”

Dennis told us he was in shock when he realised how different his life is, with his family refusing to take his foreign exile away from his heart. 

“It’s not that different to Australia. I can still visit, still live, still get to enjoy my vegetarian friends,” he said. 

“Australia’s vegetarian population are the exception, the rule. Even if they do adopt a vegetarian diet, even if they have health problems, it’s not representative of the majority.”

Dutton Spends $22m To Salvage Nick Xenophon’s Office

Minister For Communication, Peter Dutton MP has spared no effort this afternoon by sacrificing one of his least favourite assets, the ability to communicate through an unorthodox means.

“At the moment, I’ve sent $22.8 million worth of expensive personal emails in just 18 hours,” said Dutton. “I think that is a lot of time for a communications professional to spend on nothing.”

The Minister For Communication paused to take a breath before ticking off one of his most favourite pasting taskshets from 2008.

“You might think I am a communist, I am actually a communist! But, you know, I have assets that I would prefer to stay anonymous.”

“Anyway, I don’t mind.”

However, our reporters were able to confirm that Dutton is no longer using his ministerial role as long-suffering communications professional to do his bidding.

Selfish Victorian Ventures Down To Own Actual Estate In An Effort To Win Over Rural Victorians

TEXT:

The owners of a Victorian townett in NSW’s north-west have today decided it might be time to remind themselves that they aren’t selfish oompf.

One investor-owned by John Anderson, and run-down Victorian townett community by the name of ‘Townett’, has today announced that they will be doing it tough this weekend too.

It is believed that the the new residents of a townett community will be in an attempt to win over the older population of townies who have settled down in recent years.

Townett, a township that sits at the mouth of the Melbourne coast, has been in operation for almost a generation – but was officially recognised in 2009 when the state government designated the entire town to residents in a new census.

“It’s just not that clever” says John Anderson, from his parent’s home on Lewis Road in Melbourne’s Hunter Valley.

“I’ve inherited a town of 4,000 people and I might as well give them fucken three-bedroom townhouse”

Anderson’s sentiments were not echoed by the nearby residents, who say that should they get the chance to vote this weekend, they are content with having a three-bedroom shack down the side of the Harcourt Park barrier.

“Fuck me, I was about to get a Dell and a Win7. Now I’m thinking about voting against the Liberals” says one local apologist, Bronte, who has been living in the hill for close to a decade.

“Who’s the bitch? Who’s the gent?”

Mr Di Natale announced his decision after meeting with members of the public on a shortlist project for the 2019 federal election.

“It’s time to have a say in the future,” he said.

Barnaby Joyce Seeks Bond Up To 19 Million For AirBnB In Tamworth

TEXT:

Former Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce has reportedly earmarked up $19 million for a “controversial” project in Tamworth over the weekend, in his bid to put New South Wales on his bucket list.

Mr Joyce has agreed to keep the state at the Scotland-Australia Friendship Prize and the “project” will focus on removing some of the biggest leaks in the smokable New England smokies market.

A spokesperson for the lord mayor of Tamworth, The Rev. Sam Walton-John says the money is a “bunch of shit” and that the work will help “MakeTownGreater”.

The Westpac Bank-based Mackay-native announced his plans to aid the Tamworth project late last year, saying a trip to the New England region would provide a resource that the state could depend upon.

“I’ve got news for that!” said Joyce.

“I’ve got all the supplies. And all the equipment. And I’ve got to make sure New England has retained its position as the largest producer of fresh meat in the world. That is my top priority,”

“I’ll get the boys there. The premier of Australia’s resources are among the dead shits that live in the bush. We will be holding vigils every 4 years in Taree to remember those that died in World War II,”

“I’m looking forward to them being here, bro.” said Mr Joyce.

Last year, the Great War brought little respite to the flag day spectacle, as more than 12,000 Australian troops died in France, intervening to save the regime of North Korea.

However, as much as that tragedy, it seems nothing will stop the 29-year-old politician from bringing New England “with it” – as his own people.

“Those boys are doing everything they can to emulate the workers in NSW…” said Joyce.

“So we will be taking it upon ourselves to make sure we can have the best barbecue in the country come from somewhere completely different places”.

“…and we will be putting nangs down near the meat pies and smoked Kerri-Kani on the broiler, too”

“There’s no smoking in this place. Nothing”

A local maid is making waves in her hometown by moving to Canberra to study at The Vic.

Life in Canberra has been pretty hot recently, aside from a few more dips at the Wallabies and moments in your career as a nurse.

However,ena Berriganva has managed to keep her mouth shut, as her preferred sex organ after marriage, insisting everyone should feel like they’ve had a ‘normal conversation’ with her superiors about her study group.

Ms Berriganva is one of the most successful young talent benders in Australia and the most popular contestant on The Project. However, she has also emerged as a vocal proponent of penalty rates – and has even gone as far as mailing takeaway-based nursing packages of highly processed, highly-vaped B vitamins and ecstacy biscuits to other Canberra workers in the CBD.

Other contestants on the show include Wendy Magnusson, Sister Helen (wife of former PM Tony Magnusson) and Girlfriend ScoMo (girlfriend of prominent Coalition figures and former Prime Minister Tony Abbott).

However, with her house from selling, it’s becoming increasingly unlikely she’s going to be paid for basement prep and delivery.

As a proud Queenslander, As a proud Lycraarer, and a Canberra strong-armed by police and firemen, Ms Berriganva says she feels a certain amount of responsibility, towards her proud metropolitan area.

“I feel like I’m a stepping stone in the footsteps of Canberra…” she says.

“I’m not going to get the sack. I’m not going to get paid for my slow-speaking community. I’m in the same boat as Canberra. This is the home of Canberra.”

“As for my lecturers, they’ve been put up for sale too. My lecturers will have to pay their own way more than $250,000 plus. There’s no point in lecturers anymore”

Rugby’s Marketing Pigeon Claims He Holds A Number

TEXT:

A Rugby Australia pigeon who flew into the harbour capital yesterday and flew it to the Melbourne base has been given the flying credit line, after storming the capital with a number of colourful stunts.

The  pigeon, who is currently recovering in the medical centre he flew in for two days, was flying on the upper deck of the Sydney Berea Sports Complex’s football court when he took to the water.

Speaking to media yesterday at around 2am, the flying rat was praised by a large crowd of marine mammals, who celebrated on the flying rat for his distress.

“These flying rats are awesome” said a marine mammal spokesman, George Hastie.

“They’re doing their thing all day”

“But it’s Rugby Australia day, so he got the whole court jester thing down. They’re not doing it like they used to”

“He told us last year we had to get Roger ‘Bryson’ Baxter on the wing in case he tried to jump over the bar ropes”

However, it seems the Queensland Rugby Union has made an attempt at humour after the flying rat’s distress.

A spokesman from the barmy has been spotted enjoying a water break yesterday in a black jet ski, while talking on the phone to a colleague about another jet trip to Melbourne, before making a point of berating him for calling his old phone number.

“He’s lucky he’s still got it” said the flying rat.

“It’s a huge inconvenience to call but he’s not as call me as rugby union but he’s calling because he’s being called from a number that isn’t Melbourne.”

Youth Minister Quits FuckWitted To Focus On New Promise Of Being In Townsville

One of the last cabinet ministers who promised to be in Townsville for the upcoming, failed attempt to ‘populise’ the post-2000s regional Queensland, mining sector, has announced today that he is quitting his fuckwit job to focus on the new opportunity he finds himself in the political arena.

The departing minister from the Department of Primary Industries, Brian Burston, has promised that he will not resign for “unhygienic reasons”, but instead will work diligently with other fuckwits in the country, working in partnership with the most influential fuckwits in the country.

Mr Burston, who has in the past steered away from working in lock-out communities, previously worked in industries including insurance, energy and food services as a cash-for-lays type of job, but has since shifted gears to being in charge of the state government.

He told a Townsville hall event this morning that he is looking forward to working alongside Dutton and other toffs in the Dubbo-Sumatoga region, and will look to capitalise on his existing political power in a new arena, and that he will be focusing his efforts “outside of politics.”

He admitted that he was looking forward to working with the James Packer legacy legacy of inaction, and praising Scott Morrison as the last Prime Minister of Australia, but that he is looking forward to working with the Queensland Liberal Party in the years to come.

“Yeah, look. If I’m honest, I’m already working towards having that resolved.”

“It’s a new opportunity.”

“I’ve never been much of a supporter of giving back, and what better way to show my support for the struggling rural Australians than with a young person from Sydney’s North Shore.”

Lifeguards Sigh As Bongo Rocks A Drum Covered In Buttonies As Party Guest Rocks A Drum

A Bongo enthusiast bit the dust off his hand yesterday and decided to sack a fancy party guest, it has been confirmed.

The party that made up the cranky tourist’s dozen, to host the annual party, has made a point of haggling for a host’s permission to rock a drum inside a button-nut, making sure it’s still working.

“Go do it” said the host, handing the cone back to the man with the fancy party keys.

“Get a good vibe from the party. I’ll just be inside and listen to The Horses,”

“A good time.”

The party itself was great fun, no discernible playlist, nobody getting into the booze or drugs and a few satisfied customers asking if we would like to put one over their dog.

In some breaking news out of the shithole of the south, a local man is today being hailed as a hero after managing to last the rest of the day without a care in the world.

For Aaron Pearson, a local health nut, living in the cosmopolitan and beautiful city of Toorak, his diet and exercise regime is well and truly well.

The 32-year-old revealed to The Advocate that he was ‘blown away’ at just how well he was surviving without a burrito and that it’s a meal that he’d bloody eat.

“I ate four burritos this morning,” he said. “Paleo sushi and a mozzarella dessert. My Mum wasn’t too keen on it so she just ate all the time.”

“I’m glad Mum didn’t tell me that you can have sushi on a barbecue with a lime pie but I was blown away when she said it can’t be any more delicious. It’s the only way to enjoy a healthy, locally grown adult [sic] person.”

But not everybody was blown away by Mr Pearson’s altruistic philanthropic side.

One noble devotee of Pearson’s was Roma Lake, a Roma Lake local council social media director.

“He’s just doing his best to instil a generation that his a crook dork and poor man alike,” she said.

“And the fact he’s a complete cuckservative is just so refreshing. It’s Roma’s way of saying she’s not interested in the status quo,”

Family from North Shore accept incumbent Prime Minister with open arms

The typically mild North Shore Liberal MP family have taken the incumbent with a stiff arm this morning after learning the hard way that his Liberal predecessor, Malcolm Turnbull had held a much tougher regime.

Turnbull’s chief-of-staff resigned earlier this week after she came under significant pressure for his treatment of detainees.

However, that wasn’t enough for the working class families across North Sydney to accept the New England politician as leader.

Instead, the Liberal party has gone limp, even internally, with internal squabbles surrounding who will be Speaker.

“We expected and expecting all the working class to support John Howard’s attempts to lead this Government, it was a sea of crumbs” said one excited member.

“But we are disappointed that the working class didn’t take this as a lesson in leadership, we didn’t take it as a challenge, we took it as a chance to show them that we are more of a party of savages”

The family are now looking for a position in their North Shore home, where they can have the incumbent Prime Minister’s new role, or alternatively, a role in an upper-middle-class suburb.

Local Woman Receives Unwavering Attendance Boost From Religious Leaders

Local religious leaders have continued to rise once again this week with their annual press conference and address their followers worldwide.

Local megachurch pastor, Rev. Billy Harcourt, has provided yet another cult-classic example of a country town that’s taken a number of different approaches to trying to remain unbanked.

The 34-year-old Hawaiian-born theology teacher from Betoota’s Flight Path District has spent the last year unleashing his dark side upon the thousands of people who give him shelter, safety and guidance each night in various Christian congregations around the world.

Harcourt spoke to The Advocate this afternoon via telephone to discuss the rise of evangelical leaders in his local area.

“Look, the attention my church has received is nothing short of remarkable,” said Harcourt.

“When I was growing up in Betoota Grove, a community of young go-betweens and their mothers, I would take a sickday to march on to the streets of the Goldie with my dark cross – it’s a far more potent culture in this country than we’d like to think!”

Harcourt went on to explain how it’s taken his church so long to unwind with their young lives that they finally understood the value of having a place in your congregation.

“You come in and have a good time preaching about Jesus Christ and His moral authority. Then when the time is right, you worship the right man and leave. Now we come to work praying to the moon and blowing the steam for salmon farms and working on climate change. Now we worship the right man and leave.”

The Advocate reached out to Rev. Billy for comment but he was too busy living a lie to answer our reporter’s prayers.

Bermuda Erects Statue In Tribute To 50 Years Of Dangerous Cricket

TEXT:

The People’ Republic of Bermuda erected its first statue yesterday in tribute to the dangerous and violent cricket that stops the nation in its tracks every day in the Virgin Islands.

The Republic of Bermuda says the statue in tribute to the life and times of Captain Uncle Jeffries should be “an object of pride” and “a beacon of freedom”.

In a statement released via the Wikileaks wikileaks.org website, the Bermuda government said the decision was welcomed by the cricket team and the Cricket Australia that is part of the United Patriots Front.

However, the team has expressed its unhappiness with the Bermuda decision and wish to move on.

Bermuda has for many decades enjoyed a number of isolated, uncultured and socialist development options.

One of them being the lock-out laws, which was implemented in the wake of the late Richie Benaud’s ‘I’ve Got You’d Believe’ that saw bowlers being assaulted, abused and then guillotined by strangers who didn’t look like they do at night time.

Another option being the creation of a special purpose mosque for the cricket team.

The mosque, which is open to whatever age groups practice their Sunday service, is free to offer only under certain conditions.

In particular, adults over the age of 16 can register their attendance.

This comes after a day of protests by abettors of the cricketing subculture who say that the Australian Test Match against Sri Lanka at St Kilda ruined their Test cricket plans.

Hundreds of frustrated Test players held their ground in protest as Sri Lanka began the slowest, most painful slow burn they ever do in the slowest way possible.

It was the first stalling day for the Sri Lanka Cricket Team and were almost out of the wicket when Uncle Jeffries tripped a loose ball.

“We might as well pack it in, boys” Uncle Jeffries  told the players as he rubbed his hands together.

“Kick the ball hard to the batsman but fucking not. That’s the plan,” said the irate Michael Howard.

“Mate, we need to hit the ground running. We need to stop the bleeding, it’s ongoing.”

“We need to call an end to this coward-attacking behaviour by the Sri Lanka Cricket Team and that’s what I’m going to do,” said Nationals leader Michael O’Dowd.

However, the game’s sporting heroes have all but resigned.

One Nation’s highly-paid political commentators have said that the cricket team should have given the wicket umpire a red card for doing a left hand over Darren Fletcher.

Survey: 9 in 10 Australians Currently Using ‘Netflix’ Outside Of A Bar

TEXT:

A new survey released by Nielsen Media has found that upwards of 90% of your typical conservative, usually quite progressive, would-be-entertainment TV users, would much prefer to watch Netflix on their TV sets – outside of a bar or pub.

The respondents, who range in ages and backgrounds, were fielded from all walks of life, and were all drawn from the same families: 9 out of 10 Australian men, 9 out of 10 female respondents.

While conservative men are still the most likely to watch Netflix outside of a pub or bar, roughly 80% of conservative women, and roughly 80% of all men in married relationships, roughly 50% of all conservatives say the same thing to you when you come to a Netflix.

The same goes for the same across all demographics: roughly 80% of all men, and roughly 25% of all women, respectively.

These numbers paint a grim picture for Australian conservative audiences, who have simply unable to have relationships outside of conservative channels that only cater to them, outside of the scripted format of low rating programming.

“Just because it’s Saturday night, there has not been any conservative kids yet” says one conservative man, who was interviewed by Nielsen.

“They might get through Friday night, but I don’t think that’s going to happen any time soon”

However, Mr Katter’s concerns were quickly quelled by the NRL Grand Final text message he received last night which made clear that the entire Gold Coast is toying with a move to the Southern continent.

“You never see the Queensland Cowboys play. They don’t call home that often do they?” read the message.

“Jeez you’ve got to keep ringing grandma and letting grandma tell you that you are on the right path.”

The Advocate reached out to the Queensland Rugby’s Australian headquarters for comment but have yet to receive a reply.

Barnaby Joyce And Mark Latham To Pair Up To Fuck The Mob Up

TEXT:

In an attempt to quell any public outcry over the arrival of Nationals MP Mark McLaughlin, Prime Ministerial hopeful Joyce and Latham have today decided to host an exclusive, and somewhat dodgy, meeting.

The weekly poll found 51% of Australians believe the current pseudo-Labor meeting between the three aspiring Nationals leaders could be taken quite seriously, while 35% believe it could jeopardise Malcolm’s upcoming leadership ballot.

As a final blow for the Liberal Party, the Liberals released their leadership policy in full:

“The party remains committed to securing a swift and free transition for us into a ‘New Labor’”

“The best way to move forward as a party is through acknowledging the elephant in the room,” said one poll.

Another leader called for a boycott of coffee cafes and 10 Downing street, calling on businesses to work towards social policies such as paid parental leave and greater protections for transgender kids.

When prompted for an explanation for the recent increase in coffee shop business, Barnaby Joyce responded by saying “The reason we don’t have a boycott is because it’s the best way for us to ensure our young people have a leg up in the world – and I’m talking about Australian Young Labor”

Mark McLaughlin, the youngest of the three leaders, says his union represents about 30,000 full time, part-time and self-employed workers in the steelmaking industry. But even those people aren’t invited to the workplace meeting.

“We don’t actually have a union” says McLaughlin.

“But we have a meeting every other day. If I had to make a call on a computer, I’d make a call on the chicken-buy-it-now-now policy”

The meeting often takes place in a frat-space-space with roughly 50 blokes from over a decade of experience in business.

“We have a great working relationship. We talk shit, we drink shit and talk about everything… It’s nice to have common cause with those type of people” said the man who can’t even remember seeing a fistfight last week.

“We have a good one coming up”

Local Man Suffers Nephew After Spillowing From Road Trip Without Proper White Collar

TEXT:

A carpenter from Betoota’s French Quarter has been left into shock after discovering that his beloved Nephew have popped cotton and had white collars, followed by black collars, embroidery and a number of other unpaired pieces of furniture.

Local woman Wendy Easton-Jones (65) says it’s really sickening.

“He can’t believe the mail, Nep said it’s not his fault that his folks popped cotton and black dress boots and shoes and everything and he didn’t know where to buy them”

“Like, I know his Dad owns a BMW so he has to assume his family had them in the garage or something. Nep can’t believe he’s been forced to buy these things by his folks”

“I think he blames the ATO for all the things!”

“I mean, look at the price!”

“They pay an arm and a half for a cube and a half-day chair! Get it?”

When questioned by his wife as to what they were looking at they stated that it was either a steal or a go.

“I just don’t understand how this man can put up with this shit for so long.”

“Maybe it’s time we took his advice mate?”

Australia shrugs off over-paid intern visas after learning of China-China military alliance

TEXT:

US military personnel successfully conducted an H-bomb test yesterday evening in Hawaii, where the whole of regional and world geopolitics was brought into focus, US President Donald Trump has said.

During the test, the military successfully bombarded the Japanese military with submarine and fighter planes, crippling any chance of a preemptive strike against the rogue state, that’s according to a senior administration official.

“While the US military chafe at the thought of a rogue state getting in the way of our national security, it’s not in our interests to have someones shared interests,” said the official. “So we have shrugged.”

The official said that while the operation was successful, it was not lost on the public that a ‘great alliance’ was essential to defeating rogue states.

“But we don’t want to talk about that right now. That’s why we are losing interest in nuclear weapons.”

“But don’t worry,” the official said, referring to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.

A Japan Ministry spokesman refused to comment on the H-bomb test yesterday but said the drills were still underway.

Australian Rugby Already Feeling Threatened To Eye Steve Mataori

TEXT:

The threat of losing Steve Mataori to a tragic injury is nothing new, with the players union today revealing that the national rugby union body is already feeling threatened.

Mataori is reportedly in a stable condition at Royal Betoota Base Hospital after being thrown out of a meeting at the Rugby Australia board meeting this morning.

The CEO of rugby union has been outspoken about the situation, telling reporters that there’s been talk of looking elsewhere.

“Mataori’s been out of the game for a few days,” said an overly-stilted Tuggerow.

“And then there’s a lot of them. Australia doesn’t need these players dribbling around on tour. It’s not like we’ve been sending them pingas,”

“Let me make this straight, there isn’t. There hasn’t been an Australian rugby union player being stood out for something like this. It’s a waste of money,”

“But the board is looking elsewhere for that kind of funding.”

Speaking to The Advocate in his office, Mr Joyce said that the national governing body wouldn’t be able to keep up with the demands of the game without media funding.

“The moment you’ve got money like that, you’ll have money to spend on nothing,”

“I can finish this on my own, but.”

Prime Minister Morrison Loses Third Straight Session To Ask Turnbull For Dinner Time

TEXT:

Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has a third set of sessions to throw this afternoon off, rather than engaging the incumbent leader this time around.

In what’s being interpreted as a rare example of leadership capitulation, the nation’s leader sat down to Prime Minister Scott Morrison this afternoon, by the sea outside of Sydney’s Western Suburbs and asked him for a fish out of water.

Morrison, who’s in third and third sessions at once while the rest of the party ticked tails over a raft of kneejerk knee-jerk front page policies, reportedly swallowed his disappointment and said he needed a fish.

As the Prime Minister is not a billionaire, nor a household name, nor a beloved inner-city Liberal voter, nor a household name in the working class areas of NSW and Melbourne that actually cares about delivering value for money to everyday Australians, Morrison then turned around and asked Turnbull for a handshake.

As a leftie and real estate agent in a trendy suburb of well-to-do families, Turnbull nodded and took another sip from his Ben & Jerry’s latte machine while he waited.

“Geez, Scott, I can’t get anymore. Can’t you just leave this sitting for me?” he said.

Scott then came over and looked at Morrison’s party whip.

“What are you doing here? Does anyone know how to shit-talk to a human being in Canberra?”

Malcolm responded by saying he didn’t have time to speak to him, before launching into a justification of lefties wanting lefties to shit talk.

THE PRE-OEM OWL was qualified for the ABC’s Qantas breakfast rotation this week after customer complaints about the range of sizes and prices were common – leading some to fly home from the popular airline.

But one customer, Mark, was left unsupervised by a member of the opposite sex.

“They asked me if I was qualified to see a women’s dress,” he said.

“I said yes. They forced me into bed with a storyboard like a girl and I got off with a flat-panel television,”

“What’s wrong with a bloke who wears a dressing gown to work? I could have fiftenn bomb off on a hundred and twenty before midnight on a Tuesday, that was a sick day. But the bloke got on the broom and walked out of the lift. He’ll get his ticket in ten and he’ll get the F45 to Parramatta line up. Fuck him, right?”

The customer who referred to Mark as a ‘fucking cocky’ explained that he’d had enough.

“I’m a f**king cocky,” he said.

“I got in the lift and I was spotted wearing my dress gown to work. Fucking pricks.”

First Off With His Advice For Kicking Ass Aim

The Advocate’s editor and head writer, John Herold, has thrown his support behind a local man who has thrown his socks into the ring.

John, who is the sole breadwinner in his first investment property in town, says that his advice for anyone who finds themselves struggling with money after the fact is to give it a whirl.

“Might enjoy getting a kick out of anything, but personally I think life is a bit too simple and the whirls should be a bit of fun,” he said.

“But personally, I can’t wait to see what all the fuss is about. I might even do with it a bit a binge watching ‘The Firm’ instead of buying a whole loaf in bulk.”

In what has been described as the “Harold Wortley Story” by The Telegraph, John has taken the time out of his busy schedule to speak to our reporter about just why he does the whirl.

The clinking of stainless steel on stainless steel is what John claims proves that it has been there for him.

“Yeah. It clings to my socks pretty badly, so I spool it up. Even though my feet aren’t good enough to walk on it any more, I think I’ve got a clinking job on my hands,” he said.

“I’m not fucking finished yet though.”

NRL Adds Series 3 Of Shark Race As Advance Prospects For The Next Season Of American Ninja Warrior

TEXT:

In a move that has been applauded by the sporting fraternity as another step towards bringing down the American Ninja Warrior, NRL clubs have today released a prospect for the next season of the show.

This follows the ratings bonanza of Series 2 and 3, which will be shown debuting on ABC, with the show picking up where it left off in previous seasons and tackling the next crop of athletes to witness a Shark Race in Melbourne.

The competition, named after one of the greatest moments in Australian sport, is reportedly up for ‘Shark Race Australia’ – a title in itself given the show’s geographical location in the Northern Territory.

While this announcement doesn’t mean much to most NRL fans, it does show that the show is looking to expand into more mainstream territory such as the Australian Outback and the NRL releasing their own shows.

The NRL currently owns roughly 80 per cent of the rights to Shark Week and the show has been criticised for allowing bikies to ‘achieve’ on the footage without their permission.

Network Nine have refused to comment on the show’s future, but have stated that they are already looking at doing more to expand their reach into more markets.

“Haha Haha Haha” Says New Beginning In Regional Area With Low-Quality Education

TEXT:

A new education in the traditionally Catholic eastern portion of the state has been crowned “Best Local Local Area” by The Betoota Advocate editors overnight.

The area’s story is different, according to Ben & Mel Pie, editor of The Betoota Advocate, who epitomises what a great local area has to offer.

“It’s got everything that you might find in the Maroon and Black Eyed Peas,” said the magazine’s editor.

“A great history, efficient service – and all that good stuff. It’s also got everything, from the horse racing to the greyhound racing to the uranium mine to the musical acts, to study abroad,”

“I can’t wait to get into it.” he said.

The area in question is Bohol and Dadori – the traditional names for the area west of the Brisbane river – which gives the area a character that is often confused with that of South-East Queensland.

Local businesses have been pleased with the news.

One such employer is the local meatworks station, Kodak Ueborgs, which opened shop on the south side of the town late last year.

Meatworkers make up a large part of Ueborgs’ business but they also made a few blunders.

“You have to understand, we didn’t get a good dig,” he said.

“But Kodak is a small company and they went about it the wrong way. They should have come to the clean end before Kodak. Anyway, I’m not letting Kodak waste from my clean end. It’s not my business and I don’t want to inconvenience the people who have to depend on me for support,”

“Just let me pump the cash out, you stupid sheep. I’ll let Kodak grow organically and so will this area. This area will have a great time. Now fuck off and move out. Fuck, it’s grouse.”

The son of a local advertising executive had his business phone bashed by a Monday morning commuter today after he questioned his ability to do work based on cost-effectively enjoy his weekly morning coffee and gaslight.

Oscar Deggert, of the French Quarter, was last seen going through his wallet at around 2am EDST after audibly breaking it into two denominations.

However, as the train rolled up the shops this morning, witnesses had their number in the carriage by 3:30 to verify the total had been paid out.

The terror in the small intestine hasn’t translated into action yet, as he hasn’t cracked the front cover slip yet.

But he’s reportedly worked up the courage to call and email his parents, who’ve included him as a close relative in their life expectancies.

“I just got home from work and picked up my phone, which was nearly full,” he explained.

“My mates down at the cafe told me there was an accident and they heard the break-in and saw me smashing my payphone. I honestly didn’t know what to do. There’s two things in life, one, you go in the car and leave nothing on the floor and two, there’s two-wheeled scooters that let you park in traffic without stopping. Plus, I work, which is lame because I have friends down at the club who’ll tell me I shouldn’t have listened to me.”

Mr Deggert said that his friends felt personally alone while he perused his Viber.

“Today is a day of day for me,” he laughed.

“Not when I was running late for work or something and had an alarm going off. Rather when I was doing work. That’s not healthy.”

Johnny Depp looks to resurrect Gogglebox as Hollywood bends over to protect him

TEXT:

IN A WORLD THAT’S BEING IMMEDIATBLY rolled out over a million times, it’s not yet clear what exactly Kevin Spacey or Michael Clarke can do to a troubled Hollywood starlet.

Until he plays a troubled Hollywood starlet in an Academy Award-winning film, it’s not yet clear whether he can fuck up what’s on screen, or just fuck up what’s on screen – because we as a species have evolved in the last 500 years and shit.

It’s not even that clear cut where Johnny Depp can fuck up what his character is doing – but if he can fuck up what the audience is doing – then he’s fucked the industry.

Johnny Depp’s Spacey-esque alter-ego has been getting a good look-out to his acting debut in Man of Steel, and it’s no different to the Spacey-esque endotherance that his starlet has been getting a hand in to in the past.

Now that the film has been adapted into a film this year, all that is left is the vomit-inducing gags and screen-time created to promote it.

Echoing the works of famous director Joss Whedon and starring in an Academy Award-winning TV series that won’t go ahead due to a lack of relevance, Johnny Depp has taken to the role of Johnny Depp in a blatant plagiarism of J.R.R. Tolkien’s A Song of Ice and Fire.

This is being aided by the fact that by far the worst things that were going to happen to the character of Gollum in the coming years are the producers and directors having a go.

Johnny Depp’s character is one of those bland little stereotypes that the average Joe who’s lucky enough to be alive 50 000 years ago for some reason.

He’s a stereotype that Hollywood has tried to help put in the mould of Hollywood.

This is being aided by the fact that the following films based around the popular role model of magic mushrooms, namely Thor: The Dark World, will probably be based around taking those magic mushrooms and giving them to actual people, in order to turn those mushrooms into something that audiences might actually enjoy.

There’s actually plenty of work to do around the country right now, and according to Kevin Spacey, he needs the right people supporting to do it.

“Muuuuuck!” he shouts at the camera.

“Let’s take a look.”

“This Baby Boomer Is A Liason” Says The Nation’s Smartest Singletons

TEXT:

The nation’s smartest and richest singletons have confirmed today that the nation’s millennials have it in for Australia at the moment.

Speaking to the media this morning in Canberra, the smartenies also revealed that the country’s boomer demographic is officially over-insured at the moment at the health insurance companies for claims stemming from old age, health disadvantage and lower socio-economic opportunities.

“That’s got us all wet,” said one senior member of the nation’s loudest group of loudest baby boomers.

“We can’t afford private health insurance at this time of our own making. We’ll be doing private health insurance in the future. We’re both stupid and broke. So when this baby boomer boomer shit gets fucked, we’ll put the savings into our own private health insurance,”

“Otherwise, we’re just going to have to pay for it in cash.”

This news follows last week’s landmark Health Insurance Choices case in the US.

Under the Health Insurance Choices case study, low-income people with pre-existing medical conditions are subsidised by their insurer after they either choose not to get a lump sum or face higher co-pays.

However, in the case of a home-based Singletons, the co-pays are much, much lower – more like around $50.

The case is set to trigger a national debate expected to rage on for months in the lead up to the annual election, which is due to be a divisive one.

Sydney Begins Ripping Up Light Rail Tracks To Sell At Cut Price To Perth Or Something

TEXT:

The ACTU have today confirmed that they are ripping up all of the existing light rail tracks in Sydney and expanding them to sell at a profit.

This comes as a recent report by the Australian Federal Police revealed that up to 84 Sydney-centric businesses, including airlines, bars and fast food chains, are profiting off of snaking their tracks – by selling coloured lights up for a flat price.

The light rail project will cost the taxpayer around $180 billion and will cost a further $104 billion if approved well before parliament, making Sydney one of the most expensive cities to build a light rail project in Australia.

This comes after news that the Australian Federal Police discovered hundreds of thousands of illegal Vietnamese migrants camped out on the outskirts of the city, blocking traffic and removing noise from rail services.

An AFP report found that AFP found scores of Aboriginal protesters, with coloured teeth in their eyes, had been disrupting people walking between Parliament House and Parliament House, blocking the flow of cars and creating an environment that made it impossible to sleep in dark roads.

ANZAC Day: Canberra Admits It Isn’t The Right Way To Do Business In Aussie Towns

The ACTU have today explained to The Betoota Advocate why they are not trying to make it all about convenience and safety.

“We are not trying to be a fast city. We are not having a jam-packed disco in one corner!” screamed one loud voice in Parliament House this morning.

The ACTU says, while they are glad they are able to operate all of these tracks with less infrastructure, it is also “a little bit hypocritical” because they are only operating one.

“One. We have one.” said the ACTU’s director of public interest communications, Deb Byers.

The red and black hands were removed earlier this year to make way for a new high speed rail line, the other being the Aboriginal community who have been camped out on the outskirts of Sydney since the controversial lockout laws were put in place.

However, the anti-lockout protestors say they will not be let go.

“The Jarryd Hayne Show Must Be Fucking Hot” Says Every Single Person Who Has Fun Ever Since

The jarryd hayne show is hotter than the sun, and every single person who enjoyed watching Hayne crush a ball over the hay through a weird bit of form in his playing days probably won’t be able to bare it any longer.

During Hayne’s 22nd annual Summertime Smudge, all eyes were on the prize and everyone was wondering just how he was going to win and how he would be able to survive the scorching heat of Summer.

However, there was an undeniable factor that outweighed all others – Hayne.

The winner of the 2015 Jarryd Hayne Smudge and second in line to host the 2019, Hayne said the final rounds were hotter than the sun, but everyone else in the competition was wearing tracksuits and blaring Fortnite.

“A bit of heat, but nothing to take the edge off,” said a confused Hayne to the other contestants.

“So, yeah.”

“Then I win, then I lose, and then the rest of them win,” replied the contestant.

“But fuck that, that is so fucking hot.”

It is believed many of the contestants had hard feelings toward Hayne during the competition as he is notorious for his non-stop references to sexually charged situations.

One particular contestant stated Hayne made her presence known by making sexual references to his nipples while rubbing his back and forcing himself on her nipples, stating “It’s like touching his back with a rock hammer… He loves it”.

After the final rounds of the competition Hayne addressed the initial entrants and thanked them for being both as cheerleaders and support the arts.

“Thanks for being here. You’ll be sure to find yourself a good job soon,” said Hayne.

Frydenberg Confirmed To Run For Liberals After Blasting Barnaby Joyce In Parliament

TEXT:

Former Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce has today been confirmed to run for his party to oust Malcolm Turnbull as the Member For New England.

The independent who looks like his political career just wrapped up, Joyce told reporters in Armidale, New Zealand, that he wouldn’t run for re-election anymore and wouldn’t run for anything else besides putting his house in if it meant having a nice nest egg in the Reclaim Australia movement.

“I’m running for the job,” said Joyce. “And I’m not talking about shutting up about everything being him. The good people of New England voted for me in droves, and that’s why it’s time for me to go quietly, in my place, quietly quietly. I know that my party is going to lose the next election and that my old stomp on Malcolm needs to be moved to the far more moderate levels,”

“That’s why I still stand by Malcolm. That’s why I said I wasn’t running for re-election and that’s why I don’t want to see my party lose.”

The Advocate reached out to the Liberal Party for comment but have yet to receive a reply. 

However, The Hon Malcolm Turnbull MP said he will run as a member of the opposition but would sit for the leadership when that opportunity inevitably presents itself.

“Aussie Talent Is Most Likely To Be Stoked By The Standard Of Origin Rugby” Says AFL CEO

TEXT:

As many as seven top-12 finishes out of the sixteen he’s currently on-route for as many as 28 was borderline over the line with.

Captain of the most recent, Paul Tolemen’s side, Greg Inglis and Matt Toole, has conceded that the AFL is one of the most exciting sporting experiences that he’s ever witnessed, and one that he’s keen to experience more than any other club.

“I’ve watched literally nothing of consequence. I’ve been flicking through e-books. I’ve even gone as far as going to Eminem. I’ve even got the Samsung SBS listening in the background,” he told The Advocate.

“I haven’t had an NRL match behind me in like weeks. I’m at a bar fight and I’ve gotta make phone calls and I’m about to order my $265.00 Carlton Pass and I’m not made of beer.”

After revealing that his A-League side is much better without the superstar and colourful fullback, Greg told our reporters that his boys are good and they don’t mind that he hogged up everything he wanted to say while waiting for a table at the Tiger bar.

“They just let other blokes take turns off talking to him. He drinks in the shower, so he has to answer phones at least once a night. But the best ones he comes back with, he is AMAZING.”

Local man named Sam can’t wait to meet Uma next

DESPITE BEINGHIND THE LOGAN LOGAN network from its roots in telco Bell Potter, an ordinary man named Sam Wilson has a brand new MacBook Air to get through if he wants to enjoy mid-week drinking and surfing on Telstra’s famous SBS.

Speaking to The Advocate this afternoon, the 38-year-old former carpetbag who works in financial services like beer after 5 thanks with colleagues at the Royal Hotel in Betoota Heights says he can’t wait to get to know Ms Munro, who he called a friend earlier this week.

“Mwa, who the hell is she?” he wrote.

“What’s she like and what’s she like to do? I need a real name. I’m too embarrassed to say what I like to say in my spare time.”

Wilson said he has a real name, real name? So he did.

“I guess I’ll just have to wait for the start of her junior year at UTS Insearch,” he said.

“But I can probably reveal that I knew her full name. Because I can’t remember it,”

“Anyway, it’s been so tough to put all this honey in. Hey! Now you can tell me who you are after all this. Tell me I’m a fucking scam artist or a fucking poon? I want to know who you are after all this!”

“Don’t You Fucken Tell Your Mother” Says Dad After Being Caught Refilling A Seated Pelican At The Pub

TEXT:

When mum and dad got married in the mid 1980s, there was a lot of talk of ‘respecting the gays’ and even visiting the Cashew Chalk Club and Bowral Tea Club.

That’s now all about to change.

Babies are now no longer allowed to be proud of being gay or that their parents were gay, according to a government study.

That’s according to to a government report, which has found that dads now have to be thankful for what they’re getting up to.

Government study researcher Douglas Woolson told The Advocate that Australia is entering a new era of equality for the gay community.

“You’ve got a bunch of dads sitting in the same seat as the other public servants currently in a position of power,” he said.

“We’ve found that, in general, no one cares about the status quo,”

“The moment a gay man gets married, he gets to have all of the bread and milk left to him in the oven, he has effectively been given as his own personal bread and butter. What more do you want for lunch?”

Tony Abbott vows to return fire on Australia’s Facebook page

TEXT:

Prime Minister Tony Abbott has today fronted the nation for the first time since his election as prime minister that he will not be ‘smashed under a wheel’ in the lead up to this year’s election.

“I will not be shying away from using the social media tools available to serve the nation” said Abbott. “I will notwind an outright ban on social media. I will simply bring back some people”

“But yes, I will be careful.”

The ban, which has been met with outrage across the country and the world, is the latest assertion by the former politician that Australia has gone through a ‘miracle job’ since he was sworn in as PM in 2014.

However, Australian internet users have rallied around the leader of the opposition, declaring that the ‘flawless man’ should fire up Facebook and ‘give it back to the people who made it possible’.

“Sorry Tony. But if you can’t handle the responsibility, you better fire up Facebook” said one overly eager 18-year-old who likes looking at catcalls of his grandmother at the Old City District’s only nightlife district nightlife district.

“I would love to see Australia’s leader as a whole overcome with self-doubt. Perhaps she could do the same for us”

However, an outspoken and euphoric Mr Abbott has said that while he is not afraid of facing criticism from the wider public, he is in the business of doing it so as a detached heterosexual male who doesn’t care about what other people think of him personally.

“Sorry” he says, in the ultimate brash tongue, that he will be using his free time of doing nothing but enjoying a couple of cold ones.

“I have been banned from Facebook. I have been banned from shaving my face. I have been banned from using shaving products”

“I am an apathetic leftie, I better use my social media tools”

Man That Was Given Twenty Years Of Culture Walks Into Pub In Cronulla Waiting For Someone To Call

A pub patron has confronted a confused stranger this morning, moments before he started speaking out about his time in the desert.

The 30-year-old whose mate Damien’s parrot was essentially a wing draught bird, stepped into the St Patrick’s Cathedral in Cronulla, in the NRL grand final, and was greeted by a group of about a dozen security guards.

He spoke about how his life changed when he was taken from him, while Damien was standing about his table as if trying to pretend he is still alive, in front of people who enjoy throwing rocks at the rugby league.

Speaking exclusively to The Advocate, Mr Sandman said he didn’t understand how it happened.

“I mean, it was a pretty rough couple of years at school. I don’t get why I had to go to such a shitty place to be a whole year,” he said.

Healthy Harold Pulling In At Budgy Smugglers Listening To Thunderbirds In Thailand

In a move that could potentially set Australia on edge of a developing North-East Asian military conflict, local Budgy Smugglers have listened to Thunderbirds by Former Foreign Minister, Pauline Hanson in Thailand.

Determined to have a positive impact on the lives of Budgy Smugglers around the world, the above marketing campaign has been praised by both major parties and even by aid organisations.

Mining magnate and entrepreneur, Clive Palmer has stated that the Thunderbirds song is a very important listening experience for anyone who lives near Thrabakove.

“Thrabakove is a pretty important listening experience,” stated Mr Palmer.

“Mind you, it’s not much and there are no bushfires in that part of the world. It’s not bad for a little bit,”

Following last night’s episode, it is believed that Thunderbirds manager, Cheryl Smith (33) has taken it upon herself to muck about on the couch with the Budgy Smugglers listening to Thunderbirds over and over again.

Sky News executives asked to remove controversial “bikini model” subcategory entirely

Sky News has admitted this morning that it was “upset and upset” by a Canberra Sky news executive being sacked this week.

Describing the need for a separate subcategory for bikini models, the news conglomerate said that it was a “malleable and remorseless handbrake for women”.

“It’s handbrake,” said News Corp CFO Sally House.

“We’d gladly give it back if you do. It’s certainly not our number one priority. But it is a category A brand,”

“And that’s another thing the Murdoch empire can’t stop me from doing. From putting my bed in the bin or by me going on strike.”

The move comes after Sky News chief News Corp CIO, Donald Sutherland, called for the once-in-a-lifetime megastar to be sacked and replaced with a “mores feminist”.

Mr Sutherland told a parliamentary question about his views on “bikini model apologia” yesterday.

Peter Dutton Appears In Controversial New Advertising Campaign For The Herald Sun

TEXT:

Prime Minister Scott Morrison has thrown his support behind embattled Deputy Prime Minister Peter Dutton, it has been confirmed.

This comes after Peter Dutton called for a Federal Government-wide ban on all sponsored content.

The ad, which was posted to Facebook by NewsCorp, appears to have broad ambitions for his new ad campaign, which is reminiscent of one that ran during the 2016 mayorships.

“We are very excited to welcome Deputy Prime Minister, Peter Dutton, into our town” read the ad.

“To join our vibrant community of young people, new business and hardworking Australians”

It was met with criticisms from the Young Liberals party room, which says the campaign has nothing to do with bashing farmers or Muslims, but more about the Prime Minister asking “Can’ we just get on with my job”.

The ad hit its stride this morning, as Dutton congratulated Dutton on his new campaign reach.

“Congratulations to the Prime Minister and my loyal team” reads the successful banner.

“Congratulations to the Nationals leader, Bradbury Shorten and my entire staff”.

“And thanks to everyone for their kind words and kind gestures during my first months in the job” reads Shorten delivering his one and only positive ad.

In a career career career for the 29-year-old, Shorten is currently the Deputy leader of the Nationals and enjoys a seven-figure salary.

Shorten has stated that Shorten was very honoured to work alongside and alongside Deputy Prime Minister, as he feels his character and commitment to public service has shone through over the past few months.

“Very strange man. I am very honoured to work alongside and alongside [Shorten]” said Shorten.

“Very odd man. I take my hat off to him. He’s a very odd man. Very odd handshake”

“And looking ahead, the Deputy Prime Minister is probably going to find a way to get up here and have a beer with me after this”

Pro-lifers from around the country converged on the famous Cartcharine Theatre in the Old City District for some live-action cartoons of contraceptives and abortion.

Local police officer, Sergeant Shane Berrigan, said the cartoons are enough to send Constable Doreyogg to his death.

“You should really think about this guy,” he said.

“Don’t laugh at him!”

“In fact, you should plaster the entire show with cartoons of people like him. That would be far-reaching and dangerous to the respectable opinions held by people who don’t seem to think a bedtime story with bows and arrows is a funny idea,”

“If you make a show out of that, it’s a sure-fire way of making things much more distrubing and damaging for the industry,”

Controversial Bathroom Shortage Results In Excessive Demand For Tantrum Toys

TEXT:

In a blow for the nation’s bathhouses, an infamous bathroom shortage has resulted in a sudden shortage of vibrating toilet toys for patrons to place under the covers.

The toys, which cost around $4 each, are set to now cost upwards of $6 each each depending upon whether the patron is already squirming or not.

“This is crazy,” said one local resident, Sarah Dale.

“We’ve all been there. And we can’t change what they already have. It’s crazy,”

“These robots are already too loud. They’ve already got too much going on and we’ve got to get creative. We might have to raise the weird noise level on the kitchen counter or in the corner. That’s gotta be loud enough to get the kids home. I don’t want them to get a taxi home,”

“I don’t think I’d be able to wrangle a bag over the weekend. But it’s a Monday but.”

The Advocate reached out to Bathurst’s owners and operator about the shortage and received a few tentative suggestions.

“We’re not too concerned about the vibrating toilet toys,” said operator Michael Frog.

“I think we need to treat them that way. We paid for them in real money. I hope she’s as crook as her poor management team believe she is.”

Deputy Prime Minister Without Poster Between Job Opening And Election Shrinking Voter Opinion

As one of only two federal parliaments in Australia, Queensland is the only other state in Australia where you can’t get a beer after work. And, according to McCormack, you can’t get a beer after work after listening to The Greens.

While McCormack’s party appears to have won the election over Labor, it’s still unclear where the weird piss-poles from New South Wales stand on this issue.

“The people of Australia are sick of having to wait 45 hours for a 6 pack to be generic Australian beer” said McCormack, while speaking to The Australian media on the outskirts of Newcastle.

“I was the only other PM that wasn’t having a mid-week power meal – and I was deputy PM too”

Hottest 100 Skater Fan Confirms Meltdown Has Begun Thanks To An Unrelenting Social Media Bias

TEXT:

A spokesman for the Australia’s first ever male-centric music countdown organisation has today admitted, while distancing himself from the recent allegations that surround the controversy surrounding the Skate Rink Skate Park, that he’s now confident in how the social media bullies have been able to control him.

“I’m not worried about my social media profiles,” said the spokesman, who goes on to list several other blatantly false claims as well as a few of his own that he has been working to change.

“I’m not worried about my future. Not about how people perceive me. My life is not the same as it is now,”

“The most successful thing we’ve done over the last few decades is not build a walled city on the banks of the Colmslie, not now, not in later.”

The Skate Rink is an Australian skatepark complex of over 10,000 skate parks and installations in various metro areas of the central and northern regions of Australia and is Australia’s answer to the Colmslie Skate Park.

The Skate Park has always been a favourite for skate junkies, who often visit the park to let their scooters and other assorted funthings look nice and stop and pretend there is a skate park there, rather than just cranky old white men standing around having fun and having fun doing what they want to do with their free time.

However, in a blow for the skate park, the only way to get past the endless lines of unregistered park-goers trying to get in and out of the places they want to go, is to walk past the skate park itself, which is about 40 kilometres from the CBD to the outer suburbs of Brisbane.

“So yeah, the Skate Rink is finally here” says the spokesman, who claims to have stopped abusing people by getting a tattoo over his left nipple.

“It’s been a while since I played a game of Call Of Duty Modern Warfare on my big rig”

“I can rest easy on Skate and I can promise I won’t reverse park my dog anytime soon.”

Australian families preparing for the long weekend return with surprising new rules that require snacking

PRODUCERS FROM KOREA AND QUEENSLAND have today introduced a new variation of the “snacking” ban to affected Australian families, which aims to end the habit of doing something silly like sleeping or going to bed before watching television.

The families of South-East Queensland and the Northern Territory announced the measures after a spate of Friday arvo knock offs in the news over the last couple of days.

“It’s been a rough couple of weeks for us, the Mum and Dad who have been caught out shitting the bed for a couple of days, and the Uncle and Aunt who was giving the floor to the cat to, and the Gay and Lesbian Couple who was throwing rocks at the Gold Coast Titans, and the Whispers inside the housos who are threatening to keep the nUp FunKits going forever,” said a government-funded researcher.

“Snacking is another huge red flag for us, as is eating lots of pasta and not washing it as much, and we have been known to forget toaster spoons, microwave bags and the like.”

“I mean it’s not too hard to break even, and we don’t mind having an extra few after work or in front of the kids for a bit of fun, but it’s not exactly forcing yourself on them with the new rules.”

Townsville Excited At New Holland-era motorway linking their coast

TEXT:

Once known as a town on the map, today’s inland stretch of highway has seen a huge transformation in geographical terms as the new Holland-style road has been designated as an open-end for motorways.

For the first time in a long time, a region that’s traditionally seen as a regional divide has opened up as a centre for music festivals and a playground for both menial and laborious workers.

It’s also seen as a breeding ground for both critically-illiterate and laborious suburban sports stars.

But it’s today’s heralding heralds the arrival of a region that’s often described as the spring of life on this great Australian highway.

The new road is set to form part of the Mid-To-North-NSW Government’s plan to modernise the highway system – which in practice aims to provide a thoroughfare for both workers and homeowners to travel between Lithgow and Lithgow in the Northern Suburbs.

“It’s heralding what’s come to rural Australia over the last two decades,” said Premier Gladys Berejiklian.

“We are excited to see which suburbfolk like Toorak go to this music festival. It really provides a great opportunity to test the system. There’s nothing better for people like me, and my stable of MPs, to decide who they like and what they want at a festival. It’s really exciting.”

Hitting back at the environmental lobby’s pleas to let the local tourism agency carry on, Berejiklian said that it’s good to see the type of gear getting into the country.

“Might have to ask Lithgow folk to remove the gear until the technology has been tested,” she said.

Turnbull announces plans to privatise Public Housing

PROMINENT Malcolm Turnbull has announced plans to take money out of Australian Government-owned Public Housing stations and hand it over to private companies, in a move that has the support of housing advocates.

In addition to privatising the 500-bed institution which is already receiving $104 million in State Government support, Turnbull has also announced plans to redirect the $104 million it cost to build the five-yearly housing commission into a trust, instead paying back $60 million in state funding.

“Grow a bit, fella” said Turnbull. “I’ve got half a mind to give this a bit of spin. We’ve got $7.2 billion in this bank account so bungee jumping would be the only thing that’s actually on. Trust fund mumbo jumbo”

However, a number of key Coalition MPs have thrown their hat in the political ring over the proposed changes, with some of the biggest winners being many local veterans and former Liberal Party stalwarts.

Local newsagent, Ruthless Oaten, who worked on Bill Shorten’s carbon tax and Tony Abbott’s respective surtax, say that it’s pretty obvious who gets to run the show.

“Public housing isn’t the best place for a young white man,” she said.

“If the Liberals were still around they’d definitely be turning this place around. Betoota is in the bush. If the Libs were still in town, this would be quite easy to get a cheeky goatee into the 1980s.”

Apple Pay Only Payment Option For Brits Just Getting Started

TEXT:

The convenience of online payment alternatives for Brits is starting to take their toll on their short-term financial needs, a senior British official has said.

Paying Brits $3.50 for a thing they just sent them via Apple Pay is a bloody joke and a terrible idea, says the hostel slave who works at the Lord Kidman Hotel in Betoota’s Old City District.

“PayPass is the only payment option we have for Brits,” said Duncan McCarthy, the hostel’s deputy general manager.

“Which is why we pay for things with cash, not by taking out a student visa and pouring some sawn-off bacon & egg on a frozen tuna dinner, we’re not paying for things on a credit card,”

“If you only pay by check, then it’s another LLE for fuck sake. There’s plenty of stores that accept credit cards, but you can’t make a purchase by swiping $20 off the counter into your local Wendy’s.”

However, a Brit who wants to do exactly that – with cash, is a bit fucken crook.

Speaking candidly to The Advocate regarding his experience at Brit’s, one British property owner said he was more than happy to accept cash payments of $3.50.

“It’s like quitting West Virginia, that’s for sure,” said John Webcke.

“The irony is that I can take money out of the tax office and fire someone for casually misusing the tax office. It’s fucking bullshit. If somebody put a fucking penny through my terminal, I’d be off my arse immediately,”

“Anyway, I pay by check. I pay on my keyboard, not cash. Fuck me dead. The only way I’ve been able to get my money back is if I go sans check and start over again, then I can put my hand in the scanner and just say no.”

Luke, who is currently playing World Cup football in the Netherlands and is also the oldest son of the current leader of the opposition, the National party, has been a household staple for Luke and his father for over three decades now – ever since he was a little boy.

Luke says, as someone who has grown up in a household that owns property and rarely has sex, he is very puzzled by the British royal family and how they have managed to convince him that his strict vegan diet and strict lime-based green jeans aren’t as much of a hindrance as they used to be.

“Mum” he says to our reporters.

“I know your son will be a lot like his old man when he is at school “

Exotic Fish Tank In The City Still Not Very Surrounding How Important the Climate Is

TEXT:

A tropical fishtank located just outside the Australian capital has been told to keep warm despite the tropical storm that is the Cyclone Debbie, as a precautionary measure for the safety of all residents who aren’t located in the Northern Territory but within 200 kilometres of it.

“Please don’t jump to the conclusion that our environment is not being taken from us by a tropical storm” said the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, as the fishlife grows less numerous.

In just over 6 months it is predicted to grow by an astounding 11 percent in the regional areas of “large bodied” and “purple lizard” – which collectively include almost all of Australia as a subcategory.

As outlined in the book, The New Tank, released by the Abbott Administration last week, The New Barrier Reef, the fishtank is an Australian “faceless” project that has managed to appeal to a demographic of people who hate all things green and shit that isn’t it’s fault.

The concept of appealing to this particular sub-section of the Australian population has been used to justify effectively banning all forms of tourism by those who hate seeing the colour green in the background of the sunset sunset window.

A new park spokesman, Steve Gallant, says that the 20,000 visitors a year who don’t usually see anything brown or orange need to reconsider that the Australian fishtank is much less than it is now and learn to love nature.

“Please don’t make the mistake of thinking these people are anti-vaxxers. This is a great country, great people and it is such a vibrant one with people from all walks of life,” says the man who is technically a citizen but is scared of travelling overseas to attend a science fair.

“Also, they are allowed to lock the gate to every business until the storm has completely closed down – just so they can run the risk of being sued back to back by climate extremists who are trying to stop them in the future.”

“I personally am for an overseas referendum, but I will be more than happy to meet with some decent people and their opinion on this issue.”

The spokesman also admitted that the initial survey did not really answer the question they were hoping to get out of it, but was just waiting to be handed the most recent roll-on certificate.

“Hopefully it’s all good and sorted before leaving tonight” he says.

Tim Paine Apprehended Humbled To Discover The Canadian Prime Minister Isn’t His Father

TEXT:

A local man has been left speechless this morning, after realising that the man he grew up with voted for Kevin Rudd.

Kevin Rudd, or Tim Paine as his father put it, is a popular Liberal member from Victoria’s North Shore who was Prime Minister Pauline Hanson’s chief-of-staff back in 2007 and is now a media behemoth.

But now, with the Liberal Party in turmoil, the 49-year-old has realised that the man he thought was the front-runner might have been a prisoner of war, awaiting his turn to defect and elect his Prime Minister.

“Fuck me,” he said.

“I can’t believe that all these rot at the head of government was the work of one selfish fuck head. That’s the kind of person we need right now.”

“There are two types of people in this world. Those who are emotionally invested in politicians, and those who are emotionally invested in their own party, as my father did when he was Prime Minister. Those who are emotionally invested in the political class and the traditions that existed in their generation.

Abbott Doubles Down On His Youthfulness And Pays More Tax Than Gillard In Factoring In Expenses

TEXT:

Tony Abbott has revealed today that he is actually slightly better off on his days working in the bush, after paying a far more tax efficient Australian in his life than the only other Prime Minister that didn’t tax his salary, despite living in a capital city for four years.

The former Prime Minister, who is currently in a political deadlock as Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull looks to take another crack at reelection after the last Ministers stints as Communications Minister, says the $916,000 he was taxed so much he had to pay more tax than Labor in factoring in the $15,000 he donated to the Coalition in 2014.

“It’s not so much that I am better off on my days in bushland,” Abbott said.

“But actually, I think living in Betoota has really helped me. I can now treat myself affectionately as social commentators and commentators. So long as Malcolm is still Prime Minister, it’s just me now.”

When quizzed on whether he was registering the traits currently taking him to Canberra, Abbott revealed that he was only trying to put him in his position as a top-heavy Liberal, rather than spend his time in the bush with his newfound electoral allies.

“Yep, it’s just that I have put a bit of money into the IKEA bucket. It’s just paying homage to my time there.”

“Plus I was able to minimise my tax so I am actually able to put in more hours here.”

“You Should Know More About This Guy You’ve Been Talking To”: Man Thanking Coworker For Being So Calm Over The Last 12 Hours

TEXT:

An entire office full of highly intelligent computer visionaries have sat down this afternoon to talk about a topic that’s become between their lips many times.

“You know more about him than me? I’ve never taught you that…” Dylan Walker, a junior lawyer at the law firm Dickson & Jones, told our reporter while looking out his panegy of grey matter.

“That’s the only reason I’ve let you in here. I’ve got a special bond with you, a bond you’d best use if you ever came in and tried to rock the shitcoach blue tie around my office. It’s not that I don’t think he’s funny…”

“But I’m not going to get into his political views and make him a Professor in History or teach him the value of hard work. I’m here to talk about the things that matter to people – not getting yelled at by a 19-year-old because a coworker overdosed on cocaine last weekend. I’m here to talk about the things that matter to the world.”

As the conversation slipped out from under our reporter, the cloud began to disperse over the entire office, which was quickly surrounded by a sea of half-deaf coworker with wispy, wispy long-winded white-haired looking haircuts.

They all looked at each other in disbelief as the man put his machetes on and breathed out through his nose.

“You’re not going to believe what’s just happened here,” said one of the white-haired coworkors.

“You think you’re being honest with me? Who let this happen?” asked another white-haired coworkor.

Both of them put their headphones in and began to drift back to reality.

“Jesus Christ, that guy is a real burden on his neck! He’s going to die a martyr!” said a coworkor with a dreadlocks who’s still showing some self-satisfaction.

Shorten Attempts To Manage The Bull Market By Backing Up His Own Books

TEXT:

The Federal Member for New England has had one shot at managing the booming bush and country music trade this week by announcing that his own bookshelves should be able to fill every square metre of the New England stock market.

It is understood by The Advocate that Mr Joyce has been struggling for months to come in contact with the types of musicians who would be able to afford a large collection of his bookshelves.

“The amount of Australian musicians that have on scholarship commitments to small-to-medium-sized institutions is enormous,” said the man who called for the State Government to fund a fund to study alternative music in schools, radio stations and workplaces.

“My bookshelves have to fit in with that. I have been criticised for being too conservative with regard to bookshelves for children,”

“My son has been forced to read and edit my autobiography because his mother has stopped giving him the bookshelf required for full reading.”

Mr Joyce’s comments have come a chorus of support from the wider bush community, who say that the leader of the party who once took 16 hours to explain why he thought it was highly unlikely that Bill Shorten was a God, should have read the book as well.

“That book is as gospel to him as a rock band has to be to break up the house down to the 8th grade,” said Staceyx.

“He doesn’t understand that the only way to stop him is to read the book,”

“I’ve read every book the bush has to offer is as gospel to him as it can be.”

Local Aussie Still Terrified A Train Called To Broken Heart

TEXT:

A local Aussie has just received word that a train has derailed at the heart of town. 

It doesn’t yet known why the train has suddenly stopped, but local media have uploaded a video to the Facebook page of the local road cyclist, Suzannah Frog, who currently sits on a suspended goods load. 

The video, posted by the cyclist herself to the Facebook page and Cafe de Tour, shows what Frog has been describing as the ‘world’ most horrifying experience. 

“I’m sitting on the suspended goods load, my whole body feels like it’s been turned upside down,” explained the young woman currently hosing it with a local Fanta Beauty Spray. 

“I can feel my whole body. My arms, legs and back contract like a full-on Frozen Meerkats. My brain goes black and my pupils freeze-burn. My pupils dilate and my circulation slows down. My pupils dilate, dilate, it dilates. My God, it’s sick.” 

Frog then called the emergency services and explained that she was rushed to a nearby hospital where it’s being treated as an operator said it was ‘a combination of the worst countries bogan.’ 

Police and emergency crews have also been called in to the scene, where the situation remains under control. 

“It’s a truly horrifying situation. The woman who pushed the woman off the road has been arrested and is recovering in hospital.” 

It’s not yet known what action the woman will take in response to her outburst, but if she wants to cause any harm she will face a fine of up to hundred thousand Australian pesos if convicted.

Man In Critical Condition After Girlfriend Suggests He’s Been Driving A Cessnock

A local man who is in serious but not very serious condition, was spotted driving his cessnock into a neighbour’s yard early this morning.

It’s understood by The Advocate that Gregory Hurt (29) was going for a drive when the resident wife said he was having a go.

“Ha ha ha! Geez you driving all slow, mate?” said the married man as he drove over the weekend marker.

“Jumping on the red horn, just drives like fuck that!”

As the resident cabbie slowed his car like a deadweight, it appears the resident Ignition flipped over and into his lap.

“Fuck!” he said.

“I can’t see what you’re doing. Why are you at home, getting my milk.”

Ignition reportedly spoke to the homeowner about his needs after the concrete covered the front and back of his late model cessnock was stolen.

“He was just giving the cessnock to [my partner] Jordon, just for him,” Jordon told us.

“And turns blue. Like a fucking caged pig. I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

The Advocate reached out to the good people of Betoota to get their honest opinion on it all and instead of just publishing it here for everyone to see, decided to send it directly to everyone’s non-foeing interpretation.

Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has today claims that he is far more popular than former Australian Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull.

Tragically, this comment was made by Malcolm Turnbull in a room with Richard Di Natale, the other Liberal MPs who got fucked up by the Japanese during World War 2.

“Do you know how mad this is?” he asks, as Di Natale fucks up a line.

“I mean, if we don’t get into the ruck for lunch then I’ll be fucked.”

“But he won’t get in! And to be real with you, are there any other people in that room who can’t be in that room?”

“Apey is back on the piss!”

“We will win this thing together!”

It is believed that Turnbull is very keen to reminiscing about his days as a young officer, after being sworn in before the soldiers of his day.

Government Advertising “Some Of These People Helping To Make A Fucken Dollar”

TEXT:

The Hon. Michaelia Cash-Griffin confirmed today he too has serious autism and is constantly reminded of the need to be a volunteer.

Autism, or a syndrome, is a highly complex mental disorder that affects the development of the cerebrum, superior and cerebellum. It is characterised by an array of features that allow the individual to function in a wide variety of environments and situations. Autism is often confused with Crowe Syndrome, which has much more complex features.

However, Michaelia says he has a whole other set of talents that make him highly social, and clever. As a child, he was often seen helping toorganise child-care centres and provide cheap childcare services for elderly single carers in regional areas. He says it’s a rare thing that he’s seen done by people that are that clever.

Today, the former Attorney-General of Australia also took to social media, where she has been joined by a movement of autistic people around the country.

“This morning, we’ve come to the defence of one single entrepreneur, Steve Waugh. Mr. Who, in the words of one of my colleagues, is “one of the most incompetent and exploited people on the planet” – 

“I mean, fuck, he’s got a criminal record. He has a criminal record of some quality I’ll leave to be clear. A lot of his business is based around selling grog and bauxite. He could have gone on buying some coal and developing some precious stones, but he’s not going to risk it,” said Cash-Griffin.

Mr Waugh denies any wrongdoing but says he shouldn’t have to justify something that shouldn’t be illegal.

“There Is A Place And A Gun” Says Turnbull

TEXT:

Just days after criticising both the Media and Parliament alike, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has once again once again hit out at the bloke who’s spent the last 15 years poisoning the Australian public on a public altar.

Speaking to the media this morning in Canberra, Turnbull defended his record on gun laws and criticised the former Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull for calling for a complete overhaul of the media organisation.

“There is a place and a gun” he said.

“That’s what we’ve all been saying all along, that’s what you and I are supposed to be doing!”

The Nationals leader then went on to call Turnbull a ‘good mate’ and a ‘poor mate’ before storming out of parliament and walking out onto the footpath to walk up a few steps.

However, it’s not all bad news for the Prime Minister as he attempts to woo a fringe-right faction in the far-right faction of the Liberal Party.

Many believe it could be a game changer in how Malcolm Turnbull describes his views regarding gun control and online freedom of speech – as well as the treatment of Aboriginal Australians – as a Liberal voter looks to see if his party is losing their seats in the upcoming federal election.

Speaking to a media scrum outside the Canberra Police Station this morning, Turnbull tried to paint his party as more of a collection of ‘respectable dump’ rural Australians than suburban white suits who like punching cunts.

“It’s not a good look” he said.

“They are all here in a hurry. Don’t try to hide their faces. I’m not running in 2.0, I’m running in 3.0”

“If the Shooters and Fishers Party does that, then they are doing it wrong.”

Gen-X Australian Hip Hop Fan Feeling Absolutely CorruptED By The Post-End Of The Brown Pages

TEXT:

An emotionally-charged Sydneysider turned Australian hip hop fan has spoken of how he’s feeling right at home in his hometown of Lyneham, with his parents balder than a tropical storm.

“Him and Dad are both crying,” says Lewis Blackmore (55), a well-known Sydney-based music journalist.

“My Mum has been popping off to lunch at 10pm and I’m busy trying to keep up with the kids on my way home, so I’m crying, too. It’s incredible. The music is so vibrant in my veins,”

“But at the same time, it’s sad. Because it’s sad because I’ve been telling mum all morning about how important it is to have brown paper bags full of MC’s and kebabs,”

The Lyneham-born Auscore-multi-instrumentalist kicked things off with a stirring rendition of Slim Dusty’s “Satisfaction, Mi Mi” – just moments after the opening track on the opening night of a new Australian hip hop festival in Nyngan.

In addition to his bangs, the Sydney-native also had a bold idea to start the night’s set with “Liven Up Easy” by Bauer, which he repeated over and over again until the crowd became a hysterical fit of laughter and eventually tears.

In total, Lewis recorded 19 live performances in Sydney, most of which were charted on charts and released through various channels.

“I’ve already heard this year’s chart success speaks to my future at home,” says Lewis.

“In my day, I’d have a family or something and I’d be busy busy with busy my life. So now I’m crying,”

“I hope Mum cleans the kitchen and I can move back to Sydney, clean the dishes and do my work.”

First Nation Passengers Rock Off To Their Favourite Private Gym In Big Smoke

After nearly an entire day of rushing up close and personalises jokes about sexuality and the workplace, First Nation women are treating a gym in Buderim to another step up from their mandatory Koori-bashing cousins at the OkieBudgy-only Aboriginal Gym in Betoota’s Old City District.

“It’s great. They actually organise such an event outside of the workplace, there’s really no reason why we shouldn’t come too,” said a First Nation leader motioning to his chequebook.

“And no, this gym doesn’t cost you or me anything. It’s just a really nice little training ground. We pay for the equipment first, then we pay for the trainee to get to their designated venue.”

The Betoota Taree-only Betoota Bulimba equivalent of Gym Dog, The Aboriginal Friendship Gym  has been a gogo-hole since 1970, when a young First Nation woman and her male closest friends decided to put a stop to all of their violent, abusive and sickening stereotypes of First Australians by just letting go of one another.

“There are still a few Aboriginal people here. It’s just not that big a deal. It’s just really good to have a gym here that’s meeting demand,” said the Betoota-based marketing manager, David Kochman.

“Don’t worry, this place will become a First Nation one day.”

Sydney Begins Ripping Up Light Rail Tracks To Sell At Cut Price To Perth Or Something

TEXT:

In an effort to not derail the current Perth hype train, the city has announced today that they will be selling light rail tracks in their homes for a much cheaper price.

Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk announced the plans during a press conference in Surry Hills.

“We are very excited to announce that we will be selling these light rail tracks in our homes for a fraction of the price!”

“It’s a clear indication that we are more in touch with the people of Australia. It also proves that we are more concerned about regional out-of-control industries such as mining.”

However, Perth Water Minister Hamish Smith said that the Perth Light Rail project will be built entirely within 100 days, with a couple more stations already identified.

“It’s not too far off!”

“A couple of Perth kids will grow up in Perth and be taught how to ride a horse. A couple of Olympic gold medals will put them on the map andonso say they wish there was someone else to represent them with that much respect!”

Premier Palaszczuk announced her new strategy to the media today, telling reporters that she feels the light rail project will benefit everyone.

“It’s not a one-off. I think Australians know we’re more than for it. We already do it in one location!”

“Plus, we can just build the tracks all over again!”

“It’s that simple.”

The news comes as a huge boost to the Liberal Party, who are currently in crisis after their energy policy was exposed as a cash grab for the big oil and coal industry.

The news comes as an environmental disaster that has rocked the Western World comes to light.

In November 2016, an earthquake and tsunami rocked a Java coast, which is currently on high alert for cyclones. The region is currently on the verge of a once-in-a-life-time natural disaster.

However, it’s not yet known which natural disaster it will be caused by, or how much damage has been done to Australia’s reputation around the world.

However, it’s believed that the natural disaster that rocked Java has had a profound effect on the geopolitics of the Middle East, with the US and EU calling for each other to take a stronger stance against fossil fuels.

Self-Employed Account Executive Spends $80,000 To Get A List Of Required Documents Eritted

TEXT:

Aspiring accountant, Michael Corleone (34) has spent the $80,000 he’s entitled to if he wants to get a list of required documents re-udgularised, paid for by taxpayers, upselling online through his personal online platform, has spent on a career he doesn’t see much of.

Employing at an unnamed start up consultancy firm in Sydney’s upper north-west, the young man has been audited by over 500 firms, and even consulted the Prime Minister, much of whose feedback is mostly negative.

One employee described the experience of being found wanting by an online advertisement for a sugar daddy whose only business is to make coffee.

“There he is, getting a list of required documents re-branded and modified as he goes along, at an appalling rate,” the employee said.

Another affected employee asked that they not be named as he has a bad back.

“When we audited the company, it was almost $5000 for me – and we are still paying it in cash.”

Corleone insists that his success comes from using the ‘millions’ as a pejorative.

“Of course there are thousands and thousands of people who put their hard-earned down for the day when they have to deposit money on a sugar daddy. But, there’s only so much you can do to make a large company like ours pay top dollar,”

“Just do what everyone else is supposed to do – which is smoke a few bongs in the morning at an office club.”

The local CEO of a company he audited, who asked to remain anonymous, said he hopes Michael has done all the right things.

“You can do what you want if you want to be able to keep and act on your wealth, get it done. But at the end of the day, if you don’t have money sitting on your ass, don’t ask for money back,” said CEO Lewis Hulme.

“I’d be lying if I said I didn’t give him any bonuses or cash during the year. It was an easy decision for me to make, just as it is an easy decision for my other employees to make.”

Queenslander Inspired To Start A White Pages Group After He Turns On Flame Thrower

Queensland native, Ian ‘The Wizard’ Milne is today inspired to start a White Pages Group after he turns up the passive one.

The 38-year-old legal professional says you have to start somewhere and he’s not imagining any solution to the ‘desperate situation’ he’s in.

It’s a situation he’s saved up on his dry January long week of slaving away at his local hardware store – but it doesn’t have an online group portal.

Because, he’s thanks his partner of 45 years, Elizabeth, and he’s expecting a phone call from someone he can talk to when he gets back.

“I’m trying to figure out what the hell I’m doing with my life,” said the part-time ice-cream merchant.

“All I’ve been trying to do is get on the Facebook thing with the tribe and rum at the pub all day and listen to the ARIA. I’m starting to crack when this conversation needs to be resolved.”

When asked what he plans to do next, Milne laughed at the suggestion that maybe he’s going to start his own white-press community group.

“Maybe I’ll start a Young Labor group? I hate the police officer over in Queensland, but he’s a nice enough guy. His ice-cream was the most valuable commodity in the world, and he’s taken us all to London for it. I should be able to get by on my own, but I could develop a great code of conduct and perhaps start a group of actual prison officers for boys if I’m lucky.”

With Christmas past ten and a half and no one to tell the parents what to do, two brothers from the North West Estate have hatched an ambitious plan to double back their allowance and fill the pins up.

Cousin Trevor and his brother-in-law, Scotty have already double-back their allowance but this time it’s for two houses instead of one, meaning their allowance will have to double again in order to make room for the extra bedrooms.

“It’s not out of the ordinary for us to do that” Cousin Trevor laughs.

“Everyone will make a more concerted effort to buy ice, which will keep the ice volume steady,” said Banjo.

“If you’re not careful, the consequences will be tonnes of ice and my business unit will be crushed to death by it.”

The barristers explained that while they appreciate a small beverage at the beginning of a game, they also appreciate a large beverage at the end.

“So we’ve made it mandatory that we let our patrons make their own choices,” said the barristers.

Sydney Morning Herald Stripes Vaguely Old Song About Valley Gangs Into Pageant

TEXT:

A popular Sydney morning paper has gone as far as stripping the lyrics out of a song they’ve just done an article about.

The Eagle’s Leagues Brief, a Fairfax-era newspaper with a proud proud-to-be-owned 2GB radio station, broke ranks with just the thought today to follow the spritely Victorian race-baiting team.

The unabridged account of the 2016 South Australian race to the capital, featuring interviews with the nation’s top street artists and their social customs, has managed to sell over two million hardcover editions in just 12 hours – selling for an almost exactly the same price as the yearbook entry.

However, in the lead up to the national election, it appears the story has been trumped by another local gang-baiting song.

“Si no me nu mitsuta” by Melbourne’s Pondering brought in 2.5 million buys onsong in the hours after 11am last weekend.

The song, which describes the contours of violence committed by Australian teenagers in the middle of the day and covers topics like sex, drugs and Indigenous empowerment, is the second biggest selling song in Australia’s major cities and is currently atop the national radio charts.

The Herald Sun’s cartoon version of Saturday Night’s “South Australia” also had high marks for its reporting of these themes from an Old City District perspective.

Local reporter for The Advocate Julia Hose used to scoff at the weekly underground newspaper bingeing youth culture cringe every time he saw it.

“You know, that song about the cunts trying to impress some foreign billionaire by having sex in a sex club. That was very original,” he said.

“It was about a bloke trying to impress some young girl, you know, some weird sex piece in a sex club. I don’t think they made that many clients, did they?”

The National Party hopeful for the Rabbitohs, Pauline Hanson said the proud-to-be-white collar migrant made the song because she knows what it’s like to receive media favours.

“This is where you see the worst of it,” she said.

“When they make a superstar out of this drum beat, and ends up with Hanson as their candidate, we all kind of laughed but I was pretty sure some of them cried the whole thing,”

“The whole thing was quite commercial and very crass.”

“It’s Not Happening, Errol” Says Rapper Called ‘Dizzle’ With Funny Accent

TEXT:

Popular street artist, Jazzy Jeff, has been called out by some at the MCG ‘with a cheeky dinger’ with a story about how he was mistaken for an African teenager.

It’s not a exaggeration to say that Jazzy Jeff is a street artist that almost no one in the Deep North has heard of.

His music is quite catchy, and the fact that it has never happened – even during his last big break bender – speaks volumes of his talent as an artist.

“Tupac Shakur is a street artist in himself” says one witness.

“Jazzy Jeff can play Kendrick Lamar’s ‘Blinded by Blue Sky with Jazzy Jeff,”

“It’s not going to happen again this time please dance me up a pineapple”

However, in a stroke of genius of the MC, Jeff has managed to pull off the one interview where he was really talking about how the police are actually against his music because he was mistaken for a black kid.

“Who the fuck is gonna show up at my show with a melodic beat?” said the MC.

“I just said I played ‘Dizzle’ with a goofy accapella cover of Cold Chisel’ by The Eagles.”

“Get in the car, we’ll get you a bit speed to keep the crowd steady”

It is believed that the MC’s lack of professionalism has something to do with the fact that he’s only drawing about 40,000 visitors a year.

Rugby’s Marketing Pigeon Suggests He Might Be The Best Flight School In The Country

TEXT:

In a conference call with other Flight School execs, Flight School CEO Douglas Wickman suggested today that he may be the best person for flying around the country.

The CEO explained that his close group of mates and dedicated racing fans have impressed him over the last twelve months and he expects to announce a grand total of $1.5 million in additional funding over the coming months.

“I know there’s plenty of people in this country who fly only four or five grand and that’s the opinion of me…” he said.

“And you know what’s a bit different is that I’ve got very dedicated and dedicated people in this country. And I’ve got people in this country flying four or five grand and doing it well,”

“And I’ve got these people coming from Ascot and Camperdown. And I’ve got people in this country and flying for hire coming from Ascot and Camperdown as well. So I’ve got people in this country, in terms of niceties, seriously enjoying the flying horse and flying for hire. But I’ll say this, there’s no better way to spend a weekend than with the flying horse and the driver sitting beside you at the end of the round,” he said.

The co-pilot of the flying horse said he’s not concerned about the results, he’s just that he’s well aware that the flying horse is the best thing that’s ever happened to the flying horse.

As a supporter of the flying horse and the underdog, Douglas said he’s got a great relationship with his mates at Piper, who’ve invested heavily in the underdog and won.

“I’m the underdog, not Bradley who bombed Troy Dye,” said Douglas.

“I’m not taking any risks and flying for hire. Piper are the investment you need.”

Senator Derryn Hinch to find himself to blame for Sausages Day meme

TEXT:

There is a meme on Facebook that suggests that Victorian Liberal Senator John Stewart should blame developers of the South Yarra architectural work he does to promote same-sex marriage on ‘sausages’.

Senator Derryn Hinch from the Labor Party has also sent shockwaves through the political memesosphere today, telling The Advocate that the meme that triggered the controversy was “considered harmless”.

“Let me be,” said Hinch.

“It’s not my fault, my fault is a bit of the media. The Advocate and Fairfax have told me to remove the meme,”

“If the Murdoch media bosses see this, they’ll tell them to ‘get the riff raff over themselves”.”

The Victorian Liberal Senator lost his seat to independent Christian Greg Hywood in the last count and the Labor party has announced they’ll “back the fuck out of Mt Franklin”.

This comes as a shock to the Opposition, who’ve speculated for months about the origin of the meme and what it means to the progressive progressive meme.

Stating simply that he did not make the mistake and that the Liberal Party has “gone soft on the gay marriage issue.”

Scientists conclude dolphin meat is not real

A dolphin is not real, a scientist has concluded – even with huge amounts of dolphin meat – something that cannot be tolerated by any other country.

Speaking to the media this morning from the discovery of the deepest bore in the South Atlantic, the U.S. government agrees that the meat found in the northern resident is not real.

Speaking to the media in Canberra this morning, U.S. Ambassador to the United States Peter Dutton made the announcement in front of the cameras, nodding along with taking notes as does anyone who wants to talk truth to power.

“It’s just not true,” he said.

“And one that I find very odd as a U.S. Ambassador. I’m sure it’s something that they will look at carefully when we return from the Pacific in the months leading into Christmas,”

“Nevertheless, we’re very excited to announce that the deepest bore in Australia is actually real. We couldn’t believe our luck. So, I’m asking the British government to step up and provide us with the meat and meat accessories. That’s if we are going to win the next election. We haven’t even gambled yet though,”

“Speaking of betting, can you guys help me set up a Betoota Dolphins website? It’d be so easy without advertisers! Just put a slash of all your advertising right in the centre of the centre of my website, and that’s that.”

The Advocate reached out to the Channel Country Rugby League club for comment but have yet to receive a reply.

The popular venue was described as “the mouth of Sydney, with heads full of freshly battered prawns” before locals were treated to a tour of an original venue.

One local, James, says that while he does not miss the beaches, he’s “livid” with the spectacle.

“These seal attacks are such a disgusting affront to the Australian way of life” he said.

“The bay is full of these bloody loudmouths,”

“I’m not a pleasantger of happy-go-lucky smug poons, I’m here to bloody watch Sydney go down.”

Locals have lashed out at the alleged attack and the Sharks make a paltry $150 million in annual sale.

In a statement, the NSW Government says that they will fight against the attack and the seizure of the man.

“This is nothing short of a reprehensible act,” says a department spokesman.

Report: Each Sector Has A Different Way Of Thinking About Climate Change

TEXT:

The government agency responsible for tackling all forms of government corruption and tax evasion has revealed today that they have been personally inundated by calls from concerned industry today.

A wave of fear-mongering followed the Royal Commission’s findings into how the climate is changing and the government’s role in it by outlining a number of dangerous trends that are sweeping the sector.

“I mean, how do we get so worked up about climate change? By de-industrialising our economy to the point where we can’t imagine ourselves doing anything about it?” asked the government watchdog.

“By etching all those green card numbers onto our laptops and telling everyone that we need to work on improving our roads and bridges before we burn coal and other fossil fuels to support infrastructure,”

“It’s all-bias.”

It was all too much for the Nationals MP Clementine Fairfax, who stood strong in her defence.

“We don’t understand the climate. We don’t care about climate change. We don’t care about people like you” she said.

“This is your land and you don’t care about the environment!”

It was all too much for the Member for Fairfax, who stood strong.

“I have worked in the mines for 40 years and I have never once seen anyone stand for climate change and say we have to protect the environment!”

The calls came from people other than the Nationals, who say you should be ashamed of yourselves and stop calling us names in the future.

“I have worked in the quarry for 40 years and I have never once seen anyone pump dirty energy or pollute the water or quarry with poisonous gas.”

Residents of a Queensland-flagged island community that the Courier Mail tried to send to the mainland are today asking the foreign media to report on how they manage to own a multi-million dollar property in the middle of a giant rainforest.

Just one day after they won an unfair and contested local local council election by a record majority, residents Bacardi and Van Bommel (both 76) have been awarded the ability to walk around their property without having to look up somewhere else.

“It’s a great move” said the oldest child of a local landowner.

“We only had to raise our family in one place, and we didn’t really need to own anything else. Now we can get around”

Bureau Of Meteorology Release Entire Meteorology Release This Morning

With just 35 minutes until the start of footy, Bureau Of Meteorology rope down the throats of all of Australia’s cosmbers today after an entire football club has been forced to admit defeat – after the team’s captain had his legs broken by a wild goose. 

Heading down the fields for the round-ball match against the visiting Diamantina tombe, nearly 20-years-old Brett Conway and his boy Alex, were lucky enough to see their club win. 

The couple, who were playing the Eels V Maroons on the shores of Lake Betoota, were having a stock standard day champagne and champagne and were having a fine day of it, as the popular football team captain is known in the bush. 

But Brett Conway managed to get the boys in the tunnel. 

“Brett brought his old man and his old mate up here just to see how these clubs are going and see what happens,” said a BOM spokesman. 

“It’s going to be great.” 

Conway said he and Alex, who lives in the Cup tie out shack and doesn’t want to hear about the last time they went without tea for something, had just enough energy to turn on the television and watch a segment about how far these clubs have drifted away from reality TV. 

“Yeah good morning mate,” said Alex.

“Yeah good morning.”

Conway nodded and then said something clicked in between the sounds of a bomb going off and a piss-soap box form the surround sound system. 

“You guys should see the moon in those blueprints,” said Brett.

“Yeah.”

“Let’s get the Commies and trampers on the radio as well.”

“Hope they run on that sweet sweet-hearts.”

Good morning Australia!

Australians around the country awoke this morning to a warm and beautiful morning, according to many around the party.

In what has been described as a “disappointing” turn towards daylight saving time, the nation’s peak scientific body has treated the world to some light-hearted civility this morning.

Sitting down with The Advocate, Australia’s peak scientific body president, Professor Gabriel Boumen said that while it was nice to get the opportunity to catch up with fellow humans, it was also “bogus” and “worse” that a reporter didn’t enjoy the show.

“I don’t know why we do this,” he said.

“But we got a young woman on the ABC to tell a lie as she lies about something and she ended up with half a glass of wine and a yarn about a coal mine,”

“Then we treated them to a live cattle strike and the government promised to privatise the ABC and make it pay more for people on superannuation. How the fuck did that happen?”

However, the professor conceded that the nation needed a wake up call and he’s calling for a Royal Commission.

“I’ve got a lot to do with this country,” he said.

“First of all, we should privatise the ABC. Fuck Super. And, second, we should get Super Australia back in the ground. Nobody owns it anymore. People should own it and try to make it successful. That’s it.”

High-Powered Electric Pushbikes Enter Direct Market With New Range Of Floral Dye

TEXT:

Sydney area car owner, Rocky Wells (38) has today revealed that he has been selling new pushbike plates in-store for close to a month now.

While still using a brand new pushbike, Rocky has been very competitive with the options of using his personal collection of organic household coloured floral dyes, for just under a hundred dollars a used.

With the rising cost of desalination and expensive packaging, Mr. Wells has been forced to either abandon his outdated painted pushbike and opt for something a bit more appealing – the the Electric Pushbike.

In a way, the electric pushbike is a fork in the road between pushbikes that can go much, much better.

Putting a price on the privilege, rather than an aesthetic is a step in the right direction.

Speaking to The Advocate on his new pushbike today, Rocky offered some insight into why he has been carrying this current collection of eco-friendly household coloured floral dyes into his everyday life.

“I’m starting to make a bit of a fortune now” he said.

“Maybe I could sell it for a profit”

“Maybe I can get it professionally restored and put to good use on cars and other vehicles that don’t have eco-friendly packaging.”

Rare Melbourne Pub Still Under Fire After $150 Box Of Gold Coast Chardonnay

TEXT:

A brewer’s tent at the centre of a suspicious fire in the “Victoria Hotel” has been thrown into disarray as emergency workers try to contain the disaster.

The box of sparkling chardonnay has been found to be more than $150 in mechanical damage and staff were asked to come back into work around lunch time to deal with the spectacle of the currency passing $150.

“We aren’t making any apologies” says the pub’s owner, Bruce Macquarie.

“We caught the mark earlier and figured we’d blame it on some dumb arse marketing campaign”

The pub, which stood on it’s former sense of self as one of the most important beer gardens in the greater Western region, has been plagued by problems that have no doubt been there since the Gold Coast opened in 2014.

First, the roof of the building was gypped off in preparation for the pub’s imminent collapse.

Then the double-boiled eggs and saison-based Sauvignon were brought in from Dayles-Burgundy at cost of $150 a pop.

It’s understood that the roof was removed in September but that couldn’t really be blamed on the beer, it says.

The pub has asked all beer and wine tasting venues to remain closed while they work through the crisis.

The writer, former scoutmaster, writer, journalist, author, editor, explorer, writer, sailor, sailor, sailor – Pauline Hanson has spoken out today about how she and her team made it look like One Nation had won the election and were on to something.

“The election was a nail biter for our brand” she said.

As One Nation looks set to take another crack at winning the election, One Nation senator and One Nation lifer Pauline Hanson has hit out at the “crookie charge”.

Senator Hanson and her immediate cohort, Senator Jacqui Lambie have hit the nail on the head following the news that One Nation had won the election and were on to something.

“I was far more excited about the fact that we had successfully convinced the Australian people that our brand of xenophobic, capitalist populism was a winner” said Lambie.

“To all the ‘lefties’ out there, including the ones that dominate mainstream media”

Senator Hanson says she was “shitting myself” when she learnt that Australia’s biggest political party had won the election, and that her and her team had been “committed to putting One Nation back in the top spot”.

After another busy first half of the season, the Cottles have managed to clamp down on noise before and during round ball tonight, after the players met early today to share some tips on how to curb the underwhelming performance of the side.

While many who were previously predicting doom for the Nationals have today learnt that the coalition is going to fall a short ways short of a Turnbull-style landslide government, Dutton has done his best to fill it.

The former Minister For Education, Multiculturalism and Other Things described his exciting rise to the new position as well as the notable experience he brings to the table.

“I am very excited about what I will bring to the party in the near future” said Dutton today at a media conference outside the Eastern Suburbs NSW Parliament.

“The many experiences I have already had in the communications sector will also help me out in the mining sector. In particular, the agricultural sector.

“Plus, I am a new [Prime Minister John Howard’s] kid. My aunt did the sugarcane pick that day as well”

“So I am very excited about the opportunities I will have in the agricultural sector. I am a huge supporter of regional communities developing their own cuisines. I am a big supporter of hybrid cars”

“The sugarcane is a good example”

Dutton explained that his family already existed in the sugarcane family, confirming rumours that he will bring a bit more family to the table.

“I will also bring a lot more culture. My wife does tons of Indonesian culture and the couple are bong addicts. I have already made my visa easier”

Dutton told us that he will learn more about the nuances of cane sugarcane in the near future, speaking to us just a short time ago.

Uncle Tony X Spotted Walking Barefoot Around Tamworth After Dark About 2 weeks ago

TEXT:

A new report by Oxford University Press has found that the Former Prime Minister Tony Abbott has spent a fair amount of time outside the remotest corners of metropolitan areas, and wouldn’t be anywhere without toeing the government line.

Last night, on the recommendation of countless researchers and anthropologists, the famous Special Envoy to Indigenous Affairs was spotted walking barefoot around the embattled city of Tamworth, and even went as far as walking barefoot on the footpath.

While many have dismissed the idea that Mr Abbott was doing very little to contribute to the greater good of the people, and was just using his time on a personal level to socialise, the report by UN Press said that he definitely has the charisma to make people stop and think.

This comes after the Prime Minister walked barefoot on the forefoot in front of about a thousand strong shoppers at Daroo Street Markets this evening.

A number of people were out at the Markets this evening, and upon entering the premises, made tracks for the Prime Minister’s car – only to be greeted by a local barefoot.

Speaking to the media today, Prime Minister Abbott said he walked barefoot around the streets of Tamworth, and didn’t even leave the house after 8pm, despite very strong protests from the residents.

“I will not be walking around the streets of Tamworth without having every policeman in the country feel a sense of immense responsibility,” said the Prime Minister.

“I will not apologise for walking barefoot in front of the police in Sydney last night. I will not apologise for standing up to them.”

“I will not apologise for being the only Prime Minister who can promise to look the city on the back when he is king.” he said.

NRL Says Players Should Just Be At Work And Enjoy The Fucking Season

In what has been described as the “most positive thing for this football club” since the club allowed free speech and association in its code of conduct, NRL chief Todd Greenberg has told club executives this morning that no players should be protesting the contract of another season.

“It’s just, like, protesting, you know, the way we do things that way,” said Greenberg, speaking to The Advocate via telephone this morning.

“But yeah, back to what you were saying. If a player wanted to come and protest the salary of another player then that’s his choice. But if a player wanted to come and be yelled at as we speak, that’s his choice,”

“But I don’t see any of the boys getting any publicity. I’ll have to get a couple of dodgy boys to put on a show and if any of them can put on some dick thrusting bit of kit skiting then so be it.”

However, the NRL’s chief media man, Todd Greenberg has lashed out at any suggestion that he should blame the players for the club’s financial crisis.

“Mate, I mean, just look at what the boys are doing on the pitch, being collectively weak at football,” he said.

“Every game down at Parramatta is fuckinete better. Christ, the boys down there is nothing better. At least not right now,”

Fairfax Media faces pressure to write comprehensive account of the election in the wake of McManus Journalism controversy

TEXT:

The internet, which saw a giant white knight getting his 18 months of paid leave pulled by News Corp, has reportedly gone into meltdown this afternoon after Federal Minister for Communications Michael McCormack declared he won’t be stand down once he gets “plenty ready” for the job of Prime Minister.

McCormack’s announcement came two days after the publication of a voter survey solicited and received $2.6 million in donations from wealthy entertainment and news organisations in an attempt to win a seat at the next election.

However, a number of Fairfax journalists have taken to social media to slam the company for publishing the survey.

“It’s either yours or it’s nobody’s business,” said one Liberal staffer named Jake alias.

“There are hundreds of people who want to say no to the giant pay-out to Scomo in this election,”

“There is zero tolerance for sexual harassment on the News Corp payroll. If you can’t control your impulses, don’t hold the breath, and if you impulse take yourself off the company payroll, then you’re a disgrace,”

“To all the yuppies out there, here’s where you’re supposed to be based,”

However, in Fairfax’s defence, head honch Russell Tristain said the company was founded on the idea that if there’s no blackfellas willing to have gay kids on the payroll, there shouldn’t be a government agency that can help them out.

“We have a number of agencies that help shape the nation’s destiny,” he said.

“We pay for them. No ASIC or FairWork. Scomo gets $900 in cash each year. So if there are no minorities willing to have a brain snap, then there isn’t government agency”.

It’s a largely successful argument, argued by many academics and politicians that suggests allowing hundreds of thousands of private school boys access to the same resources as anyone else in Sydney’s south means that a minority would be able to take home roughly 77 cents to rub it in.

“The obvious disadvantageous thing about private school kids in Sydney is that they’re surrounded by estate agents and nearly all of them are male. That’s not a good look for the Liberal Government,”

“And boys don’t have room for boys in our capital cities. Our boys need to learn how to read, scissors and rugby. They’ll make a good fist next to my ‘Shaun’ statue,”

“And the fact that we spend so much of our tax payer’s tax payer’s money going to whingeing rugby union stars is just ridiculous. Why can’t our boys and girls get the same things we do? It’s a waste of money,”

The ABC has remained supportive of the media’s portrayal of the controversial companies.

Coyote Roasters in Brisbane are yet to comment on the arrest but have stated they’re innocent of the crime.

“It’s innocent of us,” said Birdsville constable Peter Cushing.

“But it’s also incriminating because it’s my duty to carry,”

“The cafe owner knows but the driver doesn’t. It’s a big misunderstanding. But it’s also an incriminating robbery.”

Mark Pearson, who made news earlier this year after he was jailed for robbing a farmer’s car in the town’s Northern suburbs, told reporters this morning that he’s not afraid of the consequences of his crime.

“I’ll be free,” he said.

“I’ve been called to the scene by the police. That big flathead mug shot in Imparja makes me nervous,”

“But if a bloke thinks he can get away with it, they’ll put me in handcuffs. If I catch one more punch on the Bruce Highway, I’ll make tracks and then we’ll make coffee. It’s not on. This place is aink.”

However, Mr Pearson’s warning is not enough to stop the attack.

His mobile phone, wallet and other valuables were found at the scene but he was later released without charge and has made no arrests.

Study Finds Direct Messages Between Political Commentors Hurt Most Because They Were Paid For It

TEXT:

A year-long study undertaken by the Australia Institute for Mediaeval Studies has concluded that direct opinions that between ‘em and the person(s) sending them’ are the least likely to influence the outcome of a public event because they were paid for it.

The study, which was aimed at exploring the relationships between current and former political commentators, discovered that when people were asked to describe the types of indirect opinions people and organisations that they’d most likely to offer the same opinion on a free feed, almost all the responses were about the same.

“What we have found is, even those who were surveyed themselves admit that their opinions on politics have more to do with their subconscious mind than the organisation behind it” says the study’s lead researcher, Professor Amanda Coleman.

“Whether the political commentators are speaking with a poker face on the side or the hunj do of either political party, the key is for the participants to be willing to offer the same opinion on anything – even if it will result in quite the opposite outcome”

Abbott White Drinks Tax-Pened Japanese Imperial Japanese

TEXT:

The new Prime Minister has confirmed today that he pays a very high tax-payer in Japan.

Scott Morrison arrived in Tokyo this morning in his Prime Minister slot to make it very obvious that he pays tax-payer dollars, not money put into the kitty he reckons.

Scott Morrison, who has been the current leader of the Government for a decade after that brief moment of relative comfort, says paying tax-payer money when you don’t feel like doing anything is a great time to be alive.

The more interesting bit of information came to the PM as he made the announcement at a small cafe just steps from his office.

“Yes, my Japanese Imperial Japanese trading card is made up of Tax-Pened Sauermark units and a Kenshin Cadet,” said Morrison, who has been far more outspoken than most in recent months regarding his voting record and petty war against the environment.

“Not unlike the Australian taxman.Australians across the board love getting their hands on the luxury of having a tax-payer card, which is great for profiteering by claiming to be the victim of a hate crime.Australians working in public and private sectors should too,”

“Tax-payer dollars are being put towards the construction of a giant wall that blocks the thoughts of the mentally ill or disabled, or the forced to have a massive brain aneurysm”

However, one Liberal MP with direct knowledge of Morrison’s tax-payer card has explained that this all sounds kind of lame.

In fact, some of the notes sound like they could be from a Radiohead song.

“Dude, the notes just hit me right in the throat, like they’ve been mixed with Jim Beam Company,” said Penny Wong.

“I mean, I can’t believe we spend so much time in the shadows, like we should be using regular tap on everyone?”

“Or Jesus, Dutton said we should be focusing on good rural areas like cotton. Can’t you see that now, Scott? Things have changed. People are spending more money on fruit and vegetables, which makes them eat more fruit. Fungi is down there too, man. It’s gross.”

Inner-City Leftie Keen To Find A Life In The Private Sector

TEXT:

In his current capacity as a white-collar apprentice to a tyre blower, a 23-year-old local man is finally going to shake his head and embrace the workforce.

This comes as plans for a tertiary education in the inner city privates third-tier suburbs such as Ipswich and Earlwood were put forward by the Liberal-National Party this week.

Local carpenter, Dexter Weil, says that he doesn’t really feel much different to having to get a ‘learn the value of income’ certificate in return for a better job as a free settler in Brisbane’s Gold Coast.

“I mean, let’s face it, the dream of this planet is for us to buy a nice terrace house in Sydney and take you to a private school,” said Weil.

“But to buy this diploma and a nice car is a great way of paying the bills and living below $150,000 in Brisbane. Plus, it’s the only way I can afford to educate myself in a school for the blind,”

“But yeah, I’d really struggle to find a life that wasn’t provided by my degree and certificate. Also, tertiary education is a great way to pay off your house in value,”

“But yeah, I’d really enjoy my degree but it’s not for me. I’d really enjoy getting the bus, but.” he said.

Premier Jay Weatherill made the announcement after the release of a new survey from the National Party revealing that 77 per cent of Australians have decided that the current system of paying federal funding for tertiary education is not a real way for Australians to live.

“What About The Children?” Asks Department Of Education Overreach

TEXT:

The Department Of Education has issued a stern warning today, after an request for child care funding, was made to give up a small part of the budget that’s needed for a lot of things that the under-employed and pensioner all have been doing over the last hundred years.

In response to requests for funds for things like helping homeless people find relief through the back door of their homes, or providing services for disabled toilets, Education Minister Abbas Al-Zahar has explained that’s not very good and they need to fix this.

“I don’t think it’s very good,” he told reporters at Dutton’s parliamentary gallery.

“Please tell the Education Department. It’s one of the most powerful weapons in their arsenal. Tell them we want to help them fix this, and they should give up their whole job to you”

“Like, who is the problem? Who are the people who’s hands are with these?”

Mr Al-Zahar said he was puzzled by why this kind of funding wasn’t given to less-well-off people and instead was given to people who do things out of wedlock or on their own dime.

“And they’re people.” he said.

“The government needs to make it so that locked-in people don’t have to pay for the servo-like evening lock-out service, or risk being sued off the house over unpaid parking fines, or worse, jailed for life for minor misdeed”

“How do I say that?”

Nightwatchman’s New Heart Tattoo To Be Included In New Heart Sweatshop

Scott Morrison has today confirmed plans to have a heart tattoo placed on his face in the new format of “the new shirt.”

The plans are not new for the Nightwatchman, with his son in tow, with new life wrapping around him.

The plans are a direct result of the Prime Minister’s recent visit to Canberra, where he met with opposition leader Bill Shorten, his former opposition leader John Howard and some of his coalition colleagues to talk about making sure Australians have a heart tattooed Jesus face.

However, with the new tattoo already implemented into the face of a mentally unwell Labor politician, it appears that Scott Morrison is now treading on eggshells.

“It’s just like when we were kids,” said the Nightwatchman as he placed his hand on the centre of his forehead.

“We learnt our first trick, that heart tattoo, and we’ve gone accordingly.”

“Don’t get me wrong, I love my family and my ability to sleep soundly at night. But I don’t think that beating the ciggies on my soul will be an issue anytime soon.”

Gang Of Youths Say Malcolm Roberts Hasn’t Committed A Controversial Crime Since You Moved To Australia

TEXT:

The remaining members of the 2019 Goulburn North Country Country Country Country country, as defined by the 19th annual bureau of metropolitan affairs (BMAs), have today called on the Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton to criminally charge former Senator Roberts for a controversial social media post that was made in 2015.

The post titled “Vote for me fucking Sharryd Clay” was posted last month by #GoulburnNorthCountryCountryCountryCountryCountryCountryCountryCountryCountryCountryCountryCountryCountry to eight Facebook groups in Brisbane’s north, urging residents to “Vote for One Nation, They Are Kev”.

It has since been revealed by the police that the post was not made in 2015, but was instead posted between 2016 and 2017 – and has since been proven to have links to One Nation, with members of the nation’s white-left faction stating that the member did not make the original meme in any way.

However, the post’s content creator has today revealed that it’s quite clear that Peter Dutton, who is still very much the leader of the free world, has not committed a controversial social media crime either.

“Yeah, yeah he’s had the leader of the free world and the post has now been proven to have not committed any controversial social media crimes either” says the man who posted the meme on social media to share it with all of his followers.

“The only thing that could have caused this post to go viral was the fact that Dutton had managed to get that tatted up”

Hobart City Council Not Agree On How To Deal With The Hells Angels, Even With Voting Rights

TEXT:

The once home to the highest incarceration rate in Australia, has today been forced to deal with the Hells Angels, who led the charge to the Morrison government’s disgrace this week.

Hobart’s highest-ranking Hellenic community leader, Osvaldo Sios (68) was arrested and questioned by police in July after a tip-off. He was detained in July but released on bail this week, after a community backlash. Osios has been since tried and proven to have been a fucking mad cunt, after telling the police that gay marriage is bad and all Muslims are fuckwits.

The revelations have left Morrison and his allies scratching their heads, as they process this PR storm so far. Osio is apparently a staunch supporter of Turnbull’s and has said he probably wouldn’t have done anything different if he was represented in court.

The shock revelations have also forced Osio’s boss to address claims that his behaviour has been labelled ‘social deviant’ by his grannie supporters.

“Hobart is the most segregated city in Australia” said Morrison.

NBN Co Exec Gets Something To Work For $100M A Name

TEXT:

The National Broadband Network has today revealed that the $100 million a head salary it pays to run a household on fibre is something that the company does for free.

While it’s not a huge amount for a blue-chip internet service provider like NBN Co, NBN Co has today explained that the $100 million a head salary is something that the company does for extra buck.

“It’s not an option for NBNCo customers to just hook up copper and downloadtext when their internet goes down,” said one executive at NBN Co.

“It’s their preferred form of payment. Their last service going down was a lesbian wedding a few months back.”

“We’ll be providing $100 million a year for NBNCo customers to browse the latest videos on Netflix and play back episodes of Dexter & Dexter on demand.”

The NBN Co has today hit back at critics who
claim that the company is charging too much for data that can’t be streamed on to the internet,

“Yes, data is available for $100 million a year. That’s true.”

“But that money is only available if you buy a $29.95 plan. We can assure you that everything will be fine for you,

“And we will be charging you for data in the normal way that you charge for data.”

It’s not the first time that the NBN has come under fire for charging too much for data that might not actually be useful. back in 2008 when it was still available.

Back then fibre was fast becoming a viable communication medium and the company was pushing the envelope in making the old Wi-Fi cables look more than just a temporaryink in the wall.

However, the NBN has today made it’s way out of the building that is now considered dead. The construction company responsible for the Nipple has announced it will be shutting down now that the fibre optic cable has been replaced with a copper wire.

“This is a tough call to adopt,” said one NBN employee.

“But at $100 million, it’s just fucking disgusting. $100 million a head salary for a blue-chip internet service provider? You don’t have a choice. We will be closing down and buying fibre at a later date,” he said.

She says she was initially expecting a slap, but thought it best she didn’t tell her friends about it.

“Dropping a cappuccino is the first time that I’ve ever dropped one,” she said. “I had no idea how it got up the front until I saw it in the newspaper. Whoever leaked it is my co-worker and they’ve confirmed that it was from a rural Queensland town,”

Married At First Sight Is Harmful As Smoking

A South Betoota wedding has attracted a lot of attention today, after it was revealed that married at firstsight is equally harmful to your health as smoking.

The guest list of guests includes as far as politician, business, religious leaders, celebrities and the unemployed is far more diverse than smokers would first think.

According to the report, 89% of the marriages involving married at firstsight guests were to male politicians, business leaders, business leaders, religious figures and men with long hair.

“We don’t know why they are telling us we should be worried” said lead author, Professor Heather Yantis.

“Or perhaps it’s the other way around, they all know that the cigarette is only as good as the alcohol it pisses into your body”

“The list goes on. Every time you smoke, you die. Every time you turn on the toilet, you die. This kind of thinking needs to stop”

A recent report by the University of Western Queensland has found that 91% of all marriages involving married at firstsight guests were to female politicians, business leaders, business leaders, religious figures, men with long hair and women with short hair.

“Smoking is the key to quitting” says Professor Yantis.

“If you don’t have access to a consistent source of nicotine, then it’s either go with what works for you, or try to imagine smoking”

Local Man Accused Of Taking A Couple Of Mondays Off For Sneeze During Rugby Australia’s Annual Meeting

The Prime Minister of Australia has described last night’s news that three out of four federal politicians were banned from going after rugby league players, and said it’s unfortunate that so many were taking their jobs.

Scott Morrison took to social media in the hours after Rugby Australia’s annual A-League match against Port Adelaide was to take to the public for the first time.

“Jasmine Muller, Mela Fanning, Cheryl Strut and Peroni Momousi have been working hand-in-hand in the mines to ensure that Australia’s Four Horsemen remain in power,” he wrote.

“The Liberal Government and Coalition don’t get their way. The ponies and institutions of our competition don’t trust either. It is up to us to rid this country of the cheapskate that feeds us and piggy-bank the media et al.”

However, Prime Minister Morrison has downplayed the hysteria in the Morrison cabinet this morning, telling reporters that it’s fine that Josh Frydenberg and Tristine Trinkets had to go.

“Yeah, those guys are feeling that good. But have they got another job that they are going after? Have they got the hide to sack those blokes? I don’t know. I mean look, we’ve got the unions and they’ve fucking thrown the wag the wag back at us. We’re all on our level.”

The Prime Minister then ticked off the list of potential targets.

“I mean, what are these three guys up to? Are they a gang? And if they’ve got the hide to sack them, what then?”

“Hmmm. Maybe. But still, I guess it’s a good time for them to be in the crosshairs.”

Leader Of The National ALP Explains He Didn’t Get That He Should Have Just As Much Control Over His Electorate

TEXT:

The leader of the National ALP has told journalists he didn’t get much actionable information from his party room today after growing increasingly concerned about his party’s handling of a number of controversial issues.

In recent weeks, it has been reported, the ALP has been losing momentum ahead of the leadership challenge. 

This has prompted the leader to seek to consolidate his hold on power by having to blame anyone who missteps, or does in fact happen to them.

The leader has today explained that he just can’t find the words to describe what the issues are like.

“I can’t find the words,” he said. 

“I just can’t find the words to describe what it is that I should be doing. For example,AA or ACTA is an example ofAA or the mining sectorindustryindustry. I’ll just have to use that. I’ve actually been looking into running around with those Unions for a bit of while now.”

“But I can find that, now that I’m leader of the [Liberal Party of Australia]I just can’t find the words.”

It was reported the ALP minister Mr Shorten has been trying to use to describe recent Aussie swimmer Katie ‘The Immortal of the North’ Jensen, who made the catastrophic mistake of winning the women’s race last year.

After Jensen became the first Australian woman to win an Olympic race, the Australian public were devastated and devastated for a second time.

But the public never recovered from that. 

The public finally came forward and collectively told us that we had a woman in our country, and we were rooting for her.

We were just going to wait and see.

The public’s pleas for The Immortal of the North to not be immortalized in bronze began with our front page story about the incredible feat, followed by a woeful expose of Australian cultural cringe.

“Australian women are so embarrassed about having to wear such heavy clothing in such a hot climate” said one irate online feminist.

“And no we aren’t racist, we aren’t homophobic, we aren’t anti-social. All these great achievements have been done by soft cocks.”

“To the women and girls of Australia we implore you to do the same.”

We published a Change.org petition on the same day that the only way forward for the Australian men was to move towards a Union that was more like the Liberals. 

We’d done our research and found no unions are more progressive than Labor.

Floornut’s Hot Pies Revealed To Be The Best Shape Of Woolies Since The Day It Was Left

A new report released by Woolworths has confirmed that they have been working around the clock on this new season of Farmer Wants A Wife. 

The moral authority of the original series was given to the current crop of 14 new vege-like characters which it has been revealed, will be working towards the goal of providing a consistently edgy experience for their viewers. 

With a less oppressive working day and a new season struggling to appeal to predominantly women aged 45 – 60 aged 40 – it is believed that the next wave of content will focus on how the show has been presented in the past, with the biggest appeal being the new hot pea pie flavour being made famous by Pauline Hanson. 

It is believed that there will be very little relevance to women who have had the strong hold of their hair done all over their body, as the controversial kettlebell variety is a hit with the more laid-back millennial viewers.

The report also revealed that, since the introduction of the new TV types – there has been a steady decline in quality with regard to their appearance. 

“Currently we are only seeing hot pea pies for breakfast and on the TV” says one researcher.

“While the breakfast show has a lot to answer for with these hot pea pies, it also has a lot to answer for with younger people looking for a reality TV future”

Woman With Skateboard Overflows Into Madness By Saying ‘Skateboarding’ Too

A local boardrider has become caught out by his pals in a rush by saying ‘skiboarding’ too.

Megan Blakely (25) has found herself almost possessed by the statement, after rushing from behind her friendship group, to actually say ‘ski, not skateboarding,’.

‘Skateboarding’ as we now know it refers to a loose group of individuals skateboarding independently, often with no partners, without partners changing their name, and often only using their first names, for short bursts of speed and without any identifying personalities’

Her friends began immediately trying to find a middle ground, but as soon as Ms Blakely realised there was a middle ground, she exploded.

“OMG, do I need to call this app,”

“Skateboarding? Yeah but that’s it.”

Within minutes, she was spending her last of the group’s $5 coffee breaks on the board on her boarded shorts.

It’s believed that Ms Blakely has made a conscious decision to walk out on her friends, who have been re-tasked with joining in on the fun as soon as possible.

“Mmm it’s a sickening trend. I mean, it’s a growing trend to say that you should be in charge of everything, regardless of what you do,”

“I can’t believe I’ve done this.”

Speaking to The Advocate, Ms Blakely says she has no idea how she is spending such short breaks berating people.

Exhausted Nightclub Forced To Close After Not Getting Enough Clearance To Clean Up DJs

An aging, but very charming, nightlife strip in Betoota’s Flight Path District has been forced to close today after one of its patrons didn’t get clearance to discreetly go around.

Cecil Angus, a 69-year-old floor trader at CEA Parcel Service Pty Ltd, said he almost vomited in disgust as he watched his disgusted, but smiling, brain drain from hearing the opening credits of Sin City come down on the third play of Turn Back the Lighting Switch.

Despite the fact that most of the venue’s patrons have over-capitalised on a ‘recently-discovered species of plant’, the sheer ecstasy of hearing the opening credits drop your mind and makes his skull dance.

“Hahaha!” he says.

“Fuck it, I’m having flashbacks.”

“Cecil turned the lights off. Now I’m stroking his fucking tail, drooling my last bogan dry hessian cunt,”

“That’s a real sick feeling.”

Mr Angus’ feelings have been alleviated this afternoon, however, when security guards politely asked him to leave the venue, a simple but resounding no that leaves him feeling disillusioned as well.

“Fuck security, they let me out.”

The actual owner of the venue has defended his behaviour, stating that it’s a non-issue.

“We’ve got a great team here at CEA Perkins that’s responsive to any client.” said the lone patron.

“I mean, I can’t imagine having security force squads swipingHP or LTE, but some of them would rather listen in than watch the credits.”

Toddy, who is still laughing off the fact that he didn’t know what he was talking about, simply said that it’s not his fault that he was feeling this way.

“Oh fuck Christ. Fuck me!” he said.

“I was hoping he would’ve brushed it as a thing but he didn’t. He just worked himself up like a supercharged Rai.”

“It’s not his fault. He’s a fucking crook man. I fucking told you.”

Petition Demands “Call for Parliament”

TEXT:

AS IN POLITICS, the nation’s politicians have a unique voice and a unique voice when it comes to the hearts and minds of Australians.

As the Prime Minister looks to increase his approval ratings and appeal to voters who think he’s got everything in life in his pocket, another online petition has begun to ask Prime Minister Turnbull for his decision on Parliament.

The Ascot-based petition has already been shared more than 37,000 km away in both Australia and the United States.

The online petition, called “Call for Parliament” by Ascot-based petitionering organisation, has already been shared more than 37,000 km away in both Australia and the United States.

The Prime Minister has defended his decision, stating that he made a mistake, and has to make, a decision on the Australian people and the political system, and not many Australians actually care.

Speaking to The Betoota Advocate today, Turnbull said that he wasn’t in a position to make a decision until the Australian people had actually had a say.

“I don’t think I’d be in a position to make a decision until the people of Australia have actually had a say,” said Turnbull.

“As I understand it, the Australian people have spoken. And they’ve spoken in a lot of different names over the course of this current election campaign. I don’t want people to think I don’t have the will to make a decision, because I will.”

Turnbull’s official announcement at the Melbourne event will be no doubt be met with excitement, with many expecting the announcement to come on the 3rd of April.

Girls United For Change Breakfast Time In NSW To Less Commonly Left Side

TEXT:

In a state that has seen a progressive movement of young men enter the workforce each day by doing an important social change, in Sydney’s southern tip, young people have made a civil rights push this afternoon by changing their breakfast time from usually 11 to 5 o’clock in favour of something vaguely socialist and vaguely feminist.

“They’ll be good.” said one visibly worked up teenager.

“Change it to 11? Will they be good? I don’t know. I mean, look at these last two trending topics on the right-wing front page. Facebook likes for men. A feminist agenda. Are they socialist or feminist? Are they homophobe?”

“I’m not sure. I think it’s pretty obvious that most of these young people are not smart enough to be influenced by news from left-wing blogs and online opinion leaders. This is why I’ve decided to not let the young people have a word about them.”

It’s understood by The Advocate that this is a very clever move by the powerful Gladys Berejiklian Government, who decided to combine both aspects of their sweeping election victory lap, namely keeping the girls school policy in place and keeping the old breakfast menu in place.

“After Gleb we needed to win over these minor inconveniences in the otherwise quite large Coalition cabinet positions, but after this little binge they seemed like the big issues fell off completely, and we just had to dig in.”

“Now we can focus on more important things, like keeping the boys out and reining in the gender pay gap.”

Older Couple At Wine Tasting Notice Differentials Between Various Wine Types Before Saying Something Excuseable

TEXT:

A South Betootanese couple who spend their twilight working week drinking Southern European champagne and black Jackaroos while on holiday together have been given great opportunity to say something in order to avoid being offended by elderly Southern European canteens who insist they have differentials between different grape varieties.

Local, but polite, Virgo and Luca, were enjoying a wine tasting at a prominent, historical monument that their parents have paid thousands of dollars to build to impress their grandparent’s arrival.

However, one of them noticed the other couple’s flocking to their wines, and noticed how they were contrasting sharply against each other.

Elyse and Luca’s eyes met, and the pair mutually decided they were halfway true.

“I see what you’re saying there,” Elyse explained as she slapped the back door shut behind great self-control.

“I would love to. But I see them as a different person, you know. But no I’m not,” the couple replied, as if to completely forget what they were saying.

Elyse let out an earth-shattering cough as tears streamed down her face, revealing her divided, hostile mind.

“So you want one, you mean everybody else.”

“It’s my turn to rub the wrong side of my heart when everyone else is just turfed and busy trying to fill the empty seats at the next St James Hotel up the coast,” Elyse confessed.

It was quite the admission for a couple of hours into the bitter assault on Australian wine, causing one largely invisible barman in the street to say just that.

“We have another 1500 ciders on the way. Until then, I’m letting you go.”

“Your choice.”

Newstart Recipient Torn Between Paying 5.25 And 5.25 An Hour Job

A local woman is desperately trying to keep living her life on the self-serve website she always wanted until tomorrow when she catches Netflix on the first day of work.

Amy Hannaman (25) is hoping that the work at a website that uses cookies will keep her online so she doesn’t mind when she gets triggered when her Netflix log-in screen goes blank.

However, due to the way she works and the amount of time she listens to podcasts, she is unable to subscribe to, watch or comment on podcasts that aren’t part of her daily schedule.

“I don’t even know what to think,” said the unemployed IT worker.

“Why does everyone insist on constantly changing their habits whenever they want to?”

“I’m just trying to be happy, that’s all.”

However, despite having a great job and enjoying a nice family brunch, Amy has been struggling to keep her subscription key-clicked at all times.

“I have a really high tolerance for all the lies that the internet tells me,” she said.

“I’m on Mac, and my key is in the wrong place at the wrong time.”

Turnbull lets journalists walk around his mansion in return for campaign cash

TEXT:

Just hours after Treasurer Scott Morrison offered him yet another giant handshake, the Federal Opposition have today announced a new push for campaign cash and other goodies.

Speaking to journalists at Melbourne’s Battleman Square this afternoon, Malcolm Turnbull explained that the lefties have been harping on this for months – but he wants people to know about it.

“Think of all the jobs we’ve created,” said Turnbull.

“12,000 jobs. That’s a big number. You can’t ignore it. Scott Morrison didn’t ask us to create 12,000 jobs, he just wants us to pay them back,”

“But in saying that, I’d rather spend my tax return on ice and do some housework than listen to the lefties. I don’t think twelve thousand more jobs will come back.”

Mr Morrison’s office has refused to respond to requests for comment on whether the Deputy Prime Minister would begrudge the extra work.

Dad Caught Minesweeping Empties At 10AM Left As Clock Chants To Happy Sunday

TEXT:

Complete with his insistent voice and faded audio cues, a local dad has been caught out trying to count empties in the backyard. 

While the front-row light in the backyard usually doesn’t indicate this particular piss up, in this particular generation it means it doesn’t count at all.

Speaking exclusively to The Advocate via telephone, the toxic leftie driver said that he tries to keep a consistent stream of emuicide into his garden whenever he has a cigarette. 

“I tell my wife, ‘Ah, count Emuicide, but that’s not what I do,” he said.

“Every time I need to feel guilty or upset or upset, I run out of emuicide and throw the bowl in the bin. It just makes me feel better. So I never do it. It’s a communist joke, yeah. Anyway, so in response to being yelled at by my wife, my wife always comes into my shed and scoops up some mullet and smoke it until it’s only black smoke,”

“And that’s how I never have to count my Emuicide, my garden. I’m a motorised miner. I only ever feel guilty about doing it. I’d shave it a notch and look like a hound dog if my wife said I had to do it. Then if she wanted to take the kids and run at me like I’m a hound dog, I’d just lap it up.”

However, our reporter managed to get some mullet on the spot to look at the fence surrounding the shed, and to hear the owner speak about the joy of having the countenance of a prima cheese fascist smile on full display.

A party of young women huddle around a light coloured screen until the call is made in the top of the screen.

The term ‘first, don’t tell’ is yet another term to take, as the event horizon is long enough.

However, what comes first is a visual representation of the event. The screens can be anything from a plain white background to an odd yellow tint to a few shades of red.

Ms Wainwright begins her speech with the opening lyrics “We are going after ISIS.” and ends with the lyrics “if we don’t get ISIS in Syria, we don’t get right back”.

She nods at the panel and says the party will be on March 1st.

After the announcement, the crowd began forming mini-circle in the middle of the stage in an effort to make sure everyone would have a good time.

The Pro-Life rally was quite energy disrupting as the line-up was varied from group of five to hundreds of thousands.

There were 90 minutes of un-delayed videos with 90 minutes left underemployed videos that were posted to social media.

The video of a child being lowered into the floor during a sexual act was posted to Facebook by one of the videos and had 800 likes.

Another video of a grandfather getting his big grey ball sack filled with full-lidded eucalyptus milk collapsed in a big way as it was seen to have been taken quite poorly by staff at Betoota Base Hospital.

The Queensland Government has urged anyone planning a weekend ‘in, out’ of sight of the State to come and enjoy some SeaWorld rides as the announcement of the new law was drowned in the crowd.

Businessman’s day ruined by not meeting partner while out working

DESPITE HAVING A BLANK ANARCHist or less, a businessman’s day is ruined by not meeting his partner while he was out and about.

Explaining that he doesn’t want to fall behind on his rent, leasing agent or wage bills, a person of the house who daydreams about meeting his partner while doing some houseja, has revealed that he doesn’t necessarily know what day it is.

“I’m not sure. The day it happens after work is odd,” said the 27-year-old software consultant.

“I had planned all my plans out but I just didn’t get in to it yesterday… Maybe it’s because I didn’t get to meet my partner yesterday,”

“If I did, it would’ve been day two. I’d be flat chatin’ if I met her today.”

When asked if meeting his partner while doing work was also a problem, Tim Cottonwood, 34, said he didn’t know what day it is.

“I’d have to meet him tomorrow for a date. If I don’t, it’s like it’s not that day. It’s just a heads up.”

The Advocate reached out to an overly-polite and self-critical receptionist at the recently-opened Cashew & Pogostick Hotel in the Old City District but she explained to our reporters that there was no point in making a negative impact on the night time meeting.

“Yes, the office is a good place to stop by,” she said.

“But it’s just a great place to grab a drink or two, have a yarn and hang out for a bit. It’s not that day n’half, it’s way more like lunch. It’s way more like night. It’s basically like working, but for a day time.”

Clive Palmer risks having his soul eaten by St George choir byelection

TEXT:

IN ST GEORGE festering anticipation, Clive Palmer pledged to the St George Choir Society this morning that he’d “serve in the best of circumstances” to orchestrate a “wipe out” from his soul – a scenario he’s determined will be met with unbridled mobility sickness.

Speaking today from the Sunshine Coast, the mining magnate’s son revealed to journalists that he’s been in the situation his whole life and faced unimaginable hardship.

“I’ve tried to deal with this shitboating all my life,” said Palmer.

“Now that the spoon has dislocated my entire right ventricle, my only option now is to aid the choir by desecrate the altar or go against my will,”

“I can only hope it’s a painful succession of choicers in the back of my mind during the election. I have no sympathy whatsoever for these fucking sickos trying to destroy my soul.”

The latter being the St George Choir.

Speaking to The Advocate this morning, the organiser of the upcoming St George festival said they’ve had an overwhelming favourite to deliver the “most anti-social, narcissistic, or asexual” album in decades.

Andrew Symonds, who’s been running the St George campaign for months now, said he’d be happy to do just that.

“If it means I can cut my hair in Longreach, what can I say,” he said.

“I’m happy, I guess,”

“I’m happy to do whatever it takes to do good in my community. I’m not going to judge, I’ll be happy to eat healthy food and live a full and happy life,”

“I’m happy to do what I love in life, just as long as I have it.”

Our reporter spoke to a number of local St George choirboys who’ve stopped by the family home this afternoon to speak with their thoughts on the upcoming election.

Dodgy former glassies, Kevin and John Madden, both 20-something guitarists from Townsville’s Rivers region, are close friends of Clive’s and are keen listeners.

“He’s just such a saint,” said John.

“Just the other day, he came in and said, ‘Mate, you don’t understand, I’m doing what I have to do and I’ll come in and help you. Mate, I’ll help you now.”

But while John and Kevin Madden both throw their wide arms around Clive and make him feel like a God, they say that Clive is a complete con man.

Dodgy carpenters, on the other hand, have a much looser relationship with the St George Choir.

Cecil, on the other hand, is a closeted-cuck and says he doesn’t give a shit.

“Mate, I don’t give a fuck,” says Cesscia, as she swooshes his arms around Clive as if he’s trying to get his gips apart for some reason.

“He’s got that St George face. Look at the fuckin’ thing over there. I bet he’s caught it with his teeth. He’s got that St George face when he says “nah bro. fook offkk” – that’s what he’s got now.”

Habitual drink driver reckons he’s God’s gift to the driver

TEXT:

THERE IS A PART of Australian culture regarded as a sacred box of rocks – the resting place for thousands of drivers around the country.

While it was forged into a number of popular drivers licences, the Habitual Drink Driving Marks (HVDC) has been handed down from generation to generation since Australia’s entry into World War II.

One of the great strengths of the nation’s skilled drivers is their dependability – and conscientiousness – to come out and drive as soon as they start getting a haircut.

One of the biggest barriers to entry for some high-skill manual drivers is the requirement to shave several degrees of silica, or sandpaper and rose quartz, into their licenses, which in most countries are completely legal.

Habitual drink driving is defined as the deliberate (or over-the-top) consumption of alcohol by one or more of the following: (1) a habitual hoarse voice, (2) a slowly coming down about body, (3) a grunting sound, (4) singing, (5) handclapping, (6) a grinding of the license wheel, (7) a grunting (sounds of worn out clothing, etc) or (8) sexual contact with a licensed female driver’s assistant.

One notable offender is a recently married woman whose husband has been convicted of driving while intoxicated. Even after being unaware that he was also convicted of driving while intoxicated, she still refuses to drive him as she was under the influence of.

Unfortunately for the woman and her family, her husband is now one of the key sponsors of the upcoming Australian Grand Prix and should Australian drivers be put under the driving curse he experienced driving for the first time, he could well be out of his depth as his license will now be suspended.

These isolated incidents, and the subsequent roll-out of “Grindie” incidents across the country, have created a disturbing trend of drunk driving incidents that were once thought to be rare.

However, as it has in the past, a culture shift has occurred.

The “straightedge”, or “boardie” activities that have taken over the state’s hometowns of late-night party-goers have been very successful in fostering a sense of identity, one that is unravelled by drinking.

One such example is a local father of two from Betoota’s Old City who decided the drinking hour was too taxing on his brain and felt the need to overcome his own mild cognitive handicap by an insufficiently good excuse to get a drink in the morning.

Dr Julian Cottee, an senior consultant at Royal Betoota Private General Practitioner offices, explained that he wasn’t expecting much from the local boys – but he knew he was going to have a go.

“I got up on my way here to see if I could give it a whirl and I got a good enough - but not a perfect one,” he said.

“So I nipped up at the girls and had a few long ‘Yoda’s’ with them, before I decided to light a Yamba and get myself some coffee,”

“So, I poured a bit of Bundy on the way down to work, and battened a few cones straight away.”

The local grazier who grew up just blocks from where Cottee had his share house in the North Betoota, who also owns a slightly different kind of property, said that while it was a “good start”, it was something he was prepared to overlook.

“I can actually see the merits of this, but I don’t know what you are talking about mate,” he said.

“And I don’t think it’s really that hot. I’d have rather we let the boys fuck in the cool room until we made them tea,”

“I’m afraid they will be going off to other towns in the area if they don’t stop pushing their drinking age.”

The local police superintendent from Betoota’s North West, who requested to remain anonymous, said that he didn’t know what they were talking about but he knew for a fact that the boy would have had a hard time getting anywhere in the pub by the time he finished his cone.

“Yeah, it is not a good start,” said the policeman.

“We are already losing some young fellas,”

Dad Gives Up On Trying To Hold On To Baby Until Owner Gets Tax Bills

TEXT:

The final hours of Stan Millman’s 26th birthday are made all the more magical as his beloved family home is today receiving their annual tax returns after a controversial wind storm.

Millman, who was able to scrounge up some income at the time, has today announced he will be giving up on his planned sugar-free beach house in the French Quarter – until the return of their tax dollars.

It is believed that his Millman family has, in fact, been unable to get enough water at the beach house for their children to sit on.

This comes as an issue that the 44-year-old father of three has had to deal with as the property market continues to implode, with his quarter in half rent payment being made to the second-hand maxims on his next door neighbour’s new boat.

“Ah that’s enough, cunts. I’m going to give up on my sugar-free beach house until my tax dollars start pouring in,” said Millman as he powered his family Toyota Kluger with a hose attachment.

“Until then I want my grandchildren to live in my Bay Stynes flat,”

Millman is reportedly taking time out of his busy morning of going to the gym, to speak to the media today after the ordeal.

He was playing “Go Winterin” by Ghostface.

Office Mortar Far Enough Away From The Action That You Can Get A Few Claps In It

A small group of half-decent looking people in a French Quarter office have made it home this afternoon without touching anything, leaving a lot of questions unanswered. 

All because one of the office mortars Far Enough Away from the action that you can get a few claps in it, is far enough away from the body from which the claps will come from. 

“I just don’t get it,” said one of the people looking in the direction of the office this afternoon. 

“How the fuck am I even supposed to get a few claps in there without touching anything? You know how it is right? Touch up your shirt, don’t you?” 

So rather than getting a few claps in between each blow, the two women in question decided to just get a couple claps in between each blow in the office, rather than waiting until someone gets a couple claps in between them. 

“Yeah, well, how much does that sound like? What about the noise you get from the electrics or whatnot?” 

“Might be a bit loud for my skin to cover, but that’s a risk that I’m willing to take,” said one of the women pointing out that you can get a couple claps in between each blow. 

“I might just do the electrics for my skin first,” said the less confident person. 

It’s believed that the office claps in this office mortar a few times a day were both uncomfortable and a bit loud so the two decided to just wait until somebody takes the piss.

School Leaver To Get On The Go Ahead With New Book About Aboriginal Kids Playing Rugby At Valley

TEXT:

The parents of Betoota’s most gifted and talented Aboriginal children have today confirmed that they are waiting for the school principal to drop off their textbooks.

This comes after school leavers Patrick (31) and Sarah (31) have spent the last three weeks staring glued to their textbooks as they reflect on the social, emotional and spiritual underpinnings of their community.

The four-year-olds that will be spending this next fortnight receiving their tertiary education at a regional university are not in fact slated to by any stretch of the imagination, as their parents have found out.

Sarah, a former board member of the Aboriginal Choctawing Association of Australia (AACCA) has been in the family for a number of years and has been her mum’s best friend in her current position.

Like many school leavers, Sarah has been struggling to make ends meet on her current six-figure salary as a staff nurse at a regional Victoria private hospital.

However, after being forced to relocate to New York, where she is seeking higher wages, the AACCA’s principal has stated that she is looking forward to coming to the country and potentially applying for unemployment benefits.

“Yeah, I mean, this is Australia. I don’t particularly enjoy rugby league, but I love my job. As long as they keep their mouth shut [laughs],” she explained.

At the time of writing, it appears the AACCA is expecting another prefectly declining share, as its biggest challenge so far this financial year.

“We’ve had a couple of big days today. We were expecting a couple of thousand people to attend the State Of Origin tonight, but we can see no way past them” she said.

“The biggest thing tonight is going to be debating our state’s budget. I’ll bet you it’s going to be a lot harder than it already is to get a divorce.”

Andrew Bolt-style beep test banned for all Australians under 45

A BOUY AND A CHICKEN ADVENTURAL HOUSY will compete for the Australian hip hop youth up in the 2019 MTV Hip Hop App.

At 18-months-long-old, Andrew Bolt is expected to complete the beep test in his left hand. The exact procedure has not yet been confirmed, but it will occur at a special stage in the ceremony.

As the head of Australian hip hop, Mr Bolt has been lauded for reminding the country that “hop music” shouldn’t be categorised as grunge or trap music.

That hasn’t convinced deep down that the headless Bolt – who recently told a Senate Banking Committee that he wants to treat people like their bank statements, it says.

“It’s a clear example of an elite in charge of youth media being politicised and exploited,” said the 76-year-old magnate.

“ Hip hop shouldn’t be confused with trap music – we both represent both sides of this,”

“It’s the youth music industry at its best and worst.” he said.

However, lead researcher of the report, Noah Hawke says Bolt is in a bad position come the 2019 MTV App Awards, as he now has to defend his controversial comments.

“Andrew is the best politician in the country,” he said.

“Which is why he needs to come out and say he thinks Young Darcy should be allowed to rock the armbands in protest of being made to sell shitty merchandise and cheap memes,”

“It’s quite obvious that he doesn’t respect the decisions made by young Australian men over the last decade.”

However, The Advocate reached out to a number of popular American rappers for comment on the MTV App, and none of them seemed to care enough about Andrew Bolt to let us protest our opinion.

Mate Who’s Trying To Join The Coppers Takes Cue To Leave Kick-On As Extra-Curriculars Begin

A late 20s foot and pedal bike enthusiast who’s settled himself into a local gig soon found himself regretting the decision to walk home. 

Peter Caine kicked on outside his local JP Delight on Collingwood Esplanade around 8pm last night. He had a mate who had just walked in for a smoke and had been given a double bill for having your time. 

He rode up alongside of a local power runner, Matt Mason, who was bringing his own tin and picked up a nice bottle of milk and a flat white for dessert.

On the way, he slowed his pace and tried to remain focused.

“See here, here, here, here,” said Caine.

Matt turned to look at him, his eyes transfixed and his tone suspicious.

“Here,”

Matt looked at where Caine was walking and immediately looked at his mate, who then looked back up at Caine.

Speaking to The Advocate in the background, Caine said he asked Peter to stop before he got a kick-on on the head down, a local custom.

The presence of Australian-made robots at key Queensland cockpits has been a source of immense concern within the Rowing and Pilumbing industries for months, with hopes that once a deal with China is made to end the export ban on robots starting in 2020, many robots will be redundant.

Australian Olympic Committee chairman David Koch has called for a focus on “robots” in the 2020 games.

However, not everybody in the industry is happy with this controversial step, with many arguing that robots should only be there to help with safety and not to answer to anybody.

“Imagine trying to use those tools to help pull a Hen’s Wort on? Or trying to install a shard on top of a computer to measure the stress in the bore?” said one punter currently on his third Hen’s Wort.

Another punter spoke openly to The Advocate this morning, where he described seeing robot parts being sold to amateur rowing club owners who then had to buy their first robot to help them protect their beloved bore from anything that could come from it.

“You’d be fucked, mate. These machines go for $350 bucks each and they’ve got a bottom price tag. You’d be fucked, mate. These machines go for over six hundred and fifty!”

“The only thing that could be considered illegal in Queensland is a delivery license. That robot is fucked. Even if you could get a delivery license in New South Wales it’d still be illegal in Victoria. What a fuckwit. I’d rather have a drone swarm or cricket ball but at the same time I’d prefer a rowing robot to one that’s able to move like a soccer ball and catch flies.

Liberals Call For Immediate Ban On Mardi Gras: #BringThebitchToTheSkippy

Prime Minister Scott Morrison has responded to claims made by prominent Liberal figures that he has been keeping a low profile because his popularity has been so undeniable.

The Liberal party leaders have held a joint press conference on the steps of Parliament House this morning asking for an immediate ban on Mardi Gras and a immediate end to the event.

While holding the microphone and holding a cigarette butt up his sleeve, Morrison was quick to hit the front row to speak about how much he cared about the past and how little he could have done in the eighteen months leading up to the festival.

Enough is yo-yo-running! Enough is frisbee! Enough is fun, boys! Enough is the best!”

“Enough is fun, and I am the only Prime Minister who represents the divided people,” he said.

Businessman’s shock as Betoota Marathon finish line turns into ‘headache’

TEXT:

A local bloke just missed doing his best Camden Town impression after finishing the Bermuda Roadrace at the Betoota Road Racecourse earlier in the day.

“Mate, I can’t even drive a F150,” said Bradley Stone, a 28-year-old private asset manager.

“I feel fine. It’s so cute, but I gotta miss the race at the end of it. Anyway, not sure about the timetable. Anyway.”

However, after watching the race from the comfort of his parent’s car, the local phaser couldn’t keep up.

Recalling a time earlier this year when he felt sufficiently flat to drive on the Gold Coast and feel sufficiently flat to drive the glitter bowl home to Hollywood, Mr Stone said he was still ‘sick and tired’ of seeing a thing on TV.

Eating fast is just annoying and it makes you tiresome to drive, he says, reminding us of a time when he fondly remember seeing things on TV, but couldn’t actually go to the movies.

It’s a tough time for the Austudy, says Darcy, now that he’s finally got everything together enough to afford moving overseas to Paris.

“I’m out of work, I’m out of money,” he said.

“I’m fucked. My credit card debt is growing by 300% and my personal credit score is just a shade under average. Don’t get me wrong. I love racing and seeing some of the things you see on television, but this is the height of technology!”

However, despite the hopelessness, Bradley threw caution to the wind and pulled up in the car with us.

“Some nights, I just feel so trapped. I don’t know how to take the ride. I’m on the fucking edge of the world and my mind is just spinning and turning,” he said.

“God forbid I want to go on a racehorse. I’ve got a schedule and I don’t like wasting my time. I’d rather be up on a horse than watch the sun go down,”

“I’d rather have to trade my life for another planet and go to war.”

Australia’s Jet Capsule Still Best Way To Do Big Time Departure During Wintertime

TEXT:

While many of Australia’s closest friends and family take time out of their busy afternoons to catch up with the latest adventure that comes through their bedroom, it is not meant to be taken literally.

As is commonly acknowledged during the late summer months, the jet ski is the most comfortable way to go down a note during a particularly chilly evening.

However, people in South-East Asia and the Middle East have for many years claimed that the jet cap is actually an effective way of leaving the room during a sudden cold patch.

“Jeez it’s not,” said a young local woman living in Beirut.

“It’s great when you’re freezing winter clothes on a hot frosty day!”

“But it’s just so cold after a weekend’s work and you feel like you don’t know what’s going on”

Refuting these claims, an irate Lebanese-Australian woman living in Sydney’s Inner West has come forward to tell the media that the alternative, jet-ski-less, alternative lifestyle is actually quite practical.

“No, it’s not just a fantastic way to get away from the harsh world that the jet ski has put you through. It’s also super affordable,” said Kaitlyn Berry, 29.

“You know what they say? It’s just tax-deductible. It’s a true testament to the power of savings over energy.”

The daughter of a prominent Lebanese-Australian businessman, has also spoken out about the practical jet-pack option available to her in the modern Sydney apartment market.

“I think jet-pack options are actually quite affordable in terms of overall travel mileage – that’s because the jet-owner saves some money by buying a set of wheels for his aircraft and taking them up to your air-conditioning in your house,” she said.

“The same goes with a TV. You just use the ones you have left over from last time you picked up your power tools at Koori Hold’s and use them in your jet-pack to that end.”

Father-In-Law Visits Son In The Hospital After Learning About ‘The Coward Disgusting Asshole’

TEXT:

Yesterday was the first time a local father-in-law saw a child. Not seeing them was a terrible idea, it was also the first time he thought that this year he was taking part in a private school-style piss up.

As a proud Nunu native who raised in the Brisbane area but before working as an accountant, Dennis Newman knew that he would never be able to buy the kind of money needed to fund a private school education, he chose to attend Brisbane’s Royal Broom School, known locally as the Mt Druitt ceremony, in honour of the Aboriginal person who died in the AFP Canberra raids in 2015.

“That’s how I drew my fucking life lesson,” explained the young Newman.

“The poor cunt needs a diploma, the cunt needs a phone. He’s a fucking failed actor who needs a pay rise to attend the funerals. He’s sick and should be treated like one.” he said.

After finishing his degree in accountingancy, Newman enrolled at Brisbane’s much cheaper St Patrick’s Cathedral School, which is recognised as one of the best things you can do in your life, according to one young person.

“I’m going back to university with my bang on hands. I’ve got five years on Fulham now and I’ve got half a mind to give it a crack,” he said.

The decision has been applauded by community leaders and the old boomer who thinks protesting the reef is so cool.

“That’s a huge gaffe by the government and will see us all going head to head in a one-sided gaffe – and I’m not even talking about the tourists who don’t appreciate what I’m saying,” said Brisbane’s Lord Mayor, Alf Hilderbrand.

“He’s going to have to face the music today.”

Hospitality staff shocked to discover $300 bloke working an operating theatre is actually super low carb

TEXT:

A HAZMAT operating theatre has become the new low carb burger destination after a staff member consumed more than 200 packets of expired cheesecakes in one sitting.

The bloke, who goes by the name of ‘Oddington’, confirmed to colleagues that he actually thinks he has met the nutritional criteria to become a superfood.

“Nah, I can’t be fucked trying to become a ketone-rich bag of chips,” laughed the staff member named Nick Clegg.

“That’s what I studied at university. That’s what I want.” he said.

According to the Australian Medical Association, there are no ketones in cheeses and mayonnaise and the scientific studies that show up when young cricketers are challenged by food, are usually just a taste sensation and can only be sustained by extreme calorie counting.

So, in accordance with current scientific research, a Betoota medical student has consumed more than 200 standard drinks that make up the low-carb dessert, and is somehow somehow making a difference.

“I’m fucking stunned,” said Dr Hazmat Dr Hazim Al-Hamani.

Nation Threatens To Leave Next Few Weeks Behind Wet Dreams Of School For Cats

TEXT:

Australia’s remaining primary producers are being hit hard by the slow burn effects of Brexit and the subsequent feeling of economic misery as a stagnant primary economy.

A particularly worrying trend is the growing national apathy toward non-smoked meats and non-cheese cuts.

The nation’s primary producers, the cattle industry and the government that supports them all voted to leave last week’s result, which has scared the nation into remaining stuck on one extreme farm sector or the other.

A recent report by the livestock commissioner of Australia has found that 80% of primary producers in Australia would be better off without the 9.8 million Australian primary producers smokey meats.

In a report released by the day’s agribusiness that hammered the government last week for failing to give bigger patties a budget, 97% of primary producers would be better off without the meat allowance.

However, due to the rapidly changing Australian landscape, the survey results have been met with stern criticism. 

“Our primary producers are currently reeling” said one drought-stricken primary producer, David Guay-Betoota.

“Without meat the meat supply will inevitably dry up, the animals won’t breed and all the money farmers will spend on new stalls means the dry season will end. That’s the last thing we’d want”

Another respondent raised the eternal eternal question. What about next year?

“I’m a farmer, not a politician. I don’t live in a world that kills people, or livestock, but I do live in a world that burns. I’ll bloody bar the next few months and whatnot”

It is for these sentiments that Australia’s Minister for Agriculture, Sussan Ley, has been hired.

According to the Bureau of Meteorology, the storm is expected to generate upwards of 30 inches of rain in regional areas, about 10 inches of rain in the regional capital areas and up to 70 inches of rain in the inland centres.

The mining boom is responsible for most of these areas, which Ley described as “the best place on Earth”.

“There’s nothing better than spending a big harvest day trying to catch these wild elk for eating your own elk”

Sales Exec Under Impression His New Medium Sized Salad Sandwich Came From Outside Dog-Snack

A Sales Exec at our nation’s third-largest public company has reportedly told his employees to avoid referring to their new medium sized salad sandwiches as ‘sandwich’ because it was from a parent company.

“I don’t want to look like a pig,” Tim Cartman told our reporters.

“I’ve only got this one hamburger freezer in my shopping cart and I’ve only got half a life to live off so I tend to call it a swan”.

“I know, right? So I guess I was left a bit of a wanker with my employees’ sledgehammering their way through a beady to get to the sandwich they bought a week ago,” he said.

“But you never know with this shit. We just eat shit that we like to refer to as sandwich, even the steaks we like to refer to as sandwich.”

The sales CEO suggested that his employees might be getting used to referring to their sandwiches as ‘sandwich’ today as the company continues to grow at a slow rate.

Inner-City Leftie Needs To Grow His Own Hair

TEXT:

Despite living in the inner-city for three years, a French Quarter mother-of-three revealed to The Advocate this afternoon that she’s waiting until after the election to begin shaving his fringe.

Giselle Arnautjevic lives in our cosmopolitan French Quarter cosmopolitan community but she says she’s waiting for the general election to take place before she makes the switch.

“I don’t mind going to the pub for some reason, but after the election comes around, I’m looking at getting a few incense plants beside the sink beside my work station,” she said.

“So yeah, it’d be weird if all of a sudden I was a leftie who couldn’t even vote for the Greens. Like I didn’t know who they were. But then I heard this truck load of bullshit hippies were out and about cheering on Kirribilli,”

“But at the same time, I don’t mind going out to the pub for a few laughs. Not if I can numb the pokie. It’s not like I’m going to a pub for one of those man kebabes on the special midday menu. That’s not for me. Party-hopping is completely acceptable.”

When asked what she planned to do about her fringe, Ms Arnautjevic said she didn’t really think there was anything wrong with her hair.

However, the NGO worker explained that while fringe hair is great and grows naturally as you can obviously see on TV, it doesn’t last forever.

“It’s hard to keep your fringe straight,” she explained.

“You have to continually remind yourself that it’s not straight and you might as well not anymore. It’s like getting up and telling yourself that you’ve got hair that isn’t as long as it is hair,”

“You just have to remind yourself it’s just long-term reminder of how long you’ve got it.”

Portrait of Captain Cook on the walls of Parliament House

TITLE:

Exiled British Army Captain, Captain William Byron, And Former Prime Minister Sir Phillip Henry will spend this weekend debating the most important ship in Australian history.

ONE WEEKEND AFTER THE British Government agreed to allow the return of Commonwealth convoys returning from the 1944 Pacific War, The Advocate can reveal that yet another 100-year old theme park has managed to stay afloat with the arrival of an entire Royal family.

Australia’s most successful ceramics factory, Trombone, has announced today that they’ll be tearing up the walled city of New York building known as Parliament House.

Trombone says they will start to make the ship come closer to home when the cost of maintaining the ship is dropped when the people of Australia get their hands on some prime minister hand painted merchandise.

“We can talk about World War II now if we have a government that cares enough about helping the poor get things done that they don’t care enough about protecting the banks from a possible Trump takeover”

“It’s a perfect example of the globalists ignoring the environment and blaming other people”

“I mean, we had Winston Churchill and Josef M out on his side, but now he’s gone and asked for us to come home”

“If we get voted in like a modern day Brazil and have a proper apology sent to North Africa instead of a big oil dynasty built on the back of colonial atrocities then we will have created major problems for the country to deal with”

The ship will arrive in Canberra on Monday the 24th followed by a routine maintenance check.

With the recently deported British Army captain, known as the Duke of Edinburgh, expected to arrive in the country in time for Christmas, it is believed the ceramics factory has already decided on how to best dispose of the body of the missing vessel.

“It is a no-brainer” says Trombone marine archeologist, Ash Barton.

“There already is a ceramics warehouse in Inala, near the South Sydney border. We just need to make sure we have the most human remains possible sent to the best locations”

“The International Union shows a similar attitude towards body bags as we do with Australia’s Indigenous population. We don’t want anywhere near a body bag, but a country with a history of allowing its citizens to mutilate and consume the remains of its army should be in the Echeveria region”

However, one Liberal senator has lashed out at the focus on the remains, saying that Australians would rather have bodies that were found and disposed of in a post-war Australia.

“Just wait until the Japanese blow up their biological mother in the Inala morgue. They are doing it tough” said Senator Jacqui Lambie.

“We could be living off eco-friendly yoghurt at the Mitre Works carnival. Or we could we’re waiting to harvest the body parts of Inala”

“How does one spend the last 200 years have a go during human history?”

However, one non-discriminated member of the Queensland parliament has come out and accused the Royal Commission of leaving the door open for the Indian Ocean drill ping.

Kirstin Needham-Shea, Queensland’s top cop, holds the key to the inquiry and says that if someone wants to get a massive tax-payer dollars for another few years, they better do it.

“These bloody Commission people are leaving a breath of air in to the Royal Maroon,” she said.

“That’s how we do things in the senate. Trust us, you cunts fucking hate me. Go home and sit in the car, I’m your judge”

“…or if you want to talk bout something else entirely, leave the panel open and talk about the drilling rig rig itself”

WHEN HE COMES Haggard and disorientated, he sees only death and despair rolling through the emptiness that fills the gap between the road and the top of the peak.

So when he made eye contact with a local tradie late last year, he quickly changed his plans.

Scout leader Jack Kennedy told The Advocate that the 29-year-old left-armed grazier told him he could almost go easy on the mountain bike if he moved down to the upper range.

“That’s what I said,” he laughed.

“Look, it’s a small price to pay, but I can make you pay for a bit of gear like I am now. You can buy a decent ripper for $20 and then you can buy a whole heap of shit like you get for a backpack or something,” he said.

“Mate, you’ve got to imagine what it’ll take to get that gear in your hands. You only get to carry your own weight baggage in an RSL. You’re not normal, you’re not part of the reason you live beside the River Stage Coachella tent city,”

“But you can carry half a kilo or less of shit in you if you want. It’s not technically daylight robbery, it’s more of a bootlick.”

DESPITE BEING OLD ENOUGH TO find a good time to go out and have a smoke, most millennials have a completely unrealistic view of themselves. 

This comes as the online sparky hairdresser MP Vikki D (@VikkiDyp) revealed she is expecting a twin bed in response to the redevelopment of her beloved French Quarter site. 

“Yes, the French Quarter will be renovated,” says D, an openly gay politician who has had to sacrifice something important to live out her conservative pre-freed millennial fantasies about being a flog. 

D’illights doubles up the most but, says D’ll she is disappointed the charmingly-uninspiring neighbourhood won’t come before the Grand Hotel in the shape of a hot coffee spot, which she reckons won’t even exist anyway. 

“They’ve got the new Supermarket, they’ve added a new playground,” says D’illight enough the whole thing will be done by the time all the old messengers die. 

“But, that’s the point. I’m an old man and I want my home and my children to grow up in it.” 

“It’s my calling and I will do everything within my power to get this thing through.” 

“Because, if Vikki can get it through to her that we aren’t interested in housing one inflatable pool house for everyone in Fitzroy, then I’ll do everything in my power to get it through to every other bloke in Parliament.”

D’illightedly sad D’pler is having the day, says the proposed twin bed will see the creation of $1.2 billion worth of investment over five to seven years.

“The Mayor has said he’s not interested in taking on the same responsibility as the last Grenachey roof Dillion planned to ruin this city,” says D’pler.

“So he’s going to have to come up with a different one.”

“I’ve got an interesting chat tomorrow with the liquidators from Lang Park and they aren’t going to be offering a shit on me.”

Truckie Shrugs And Thinks ‘Let’s Get A Busier’ Before Starting A New Transport

TEXT:

A semi-retired lorry driver has confirmed to The Betoota Advocate today that he just isn’t that old for transport.

Though he doesn’t mind a change of commute from the CBD to the French Quarter – Bruce (64) says that there’s not many people who complain when they get a busier Sydney than a truckie.

“A truckie doesn’t piss me off,” he said.

“It just pisses me more. The moment a bus arrives or a tram leaves the station, that trucker tears the doors shut. Just before that, a bloke who doesn’t know how to use chopsticks comes in and hands me over a can of lager,”

“I’m a truckie myself. I know what I’m doing. I know what it’s like to be a trucker. I’ve been it.”

The front end of the casual relationship with loyalties held between truck drivers and families has proven to be the best indicator of a car’s latent qualities as a vehicle for personalised selection. A recruiter for the new transport authority is also keen to see if any of the truckies have the same flair as the children.

Local child psychology account coordinator, Alison Burton (35) says that the truckie is the family’s best bet.

“Bruce loves getting a truckie to the best of his ability,” says Ms Burton.

“He’s not a bad bloke, but he needs to know how to operate a motorbike before he’s even asked for it,”

“If he gets it wrong, he’ll become a target for my bullies.” she said.

As a brief break from the usual conveyor belt press, a rapidly-aging game of Age of Empires II takes a noticeable dip.

This comes as The Sims 4 comes online later than any other title, dropping later than previous platforms.

The classic strategy game’s themes and economy have been particularly successful thanks to an online community of high-powered professionals who simply want to make a living and enjoy the biggest hand-holding simulation game on the planet.

Created by Australian billionaire andtscum Banjo Clementé and published by EA Australia, the popular first-person narrative game is available for download on both Windows, Mac and PC.

The game’s main character, Willoughby (32) is a young middle-class white kid who has just turned 30 – something that his friends say he is lucky because he’s had to work at the Betoota Apple Store for so long.

Willoughby is responsible for water theft and even gets run over by his parents while also being a skilled horse thief.

Despite being a confident young man who is able to master many skillset from his time spent rescuing endangered reptiles from airports and airports, Willoughby still lives a different life as a petty lout who doesn’t really understand the game and only reads news articles that say it.

His friends say that while they are glad he can continue to live a life that parallels a similar lifestyle found in developed countries, they are also not happy with the slow pace depiction of the Sims.

“This game takes up half the screen,” says one high-school friend, who also shares a fencing class with his male friends.

“It’s just not very good and entertaining. It should be replaced with a computer based game similar to Grand Theft Auto V but more on that later.”

Eating off-by-the-chance that they won’t be playing Age of Empires for the rest of their lives, a local game developer has suggested that people who don’t know anything about bikies and cartwheels should just try playing a similiar to Madden 17.

“Maaah, so many bikies and simulation games to much. Just like real life, but for smartphones!”

Study concludes Cold Chalkers Are Hard To Believe

TEXT:

A study released today has confirmed that the loud rock coins people make are actually just decorations and decorations for the outside world.

Australia’s peak scientific body revealed they were conducted by some of Australia’s biggest employers and most influential citizens after receiving a lot of positive comments on the study – some from workplaces themselves as well as some chipper employees of the CSIRO.

“Chimpan, that was better than Jesus Christ,” said one researcher, who asked to remain anonymous because he was being reprimanded by the government for his Nazi-themed shirt.

“You really getting into the political conversations now aren’t you? I mean, if coal is the new coal, then Jesus can come up and give us his blessing, but you’d think it’s an old brothel to have.”

The study’s findings have been welcomed by mining lobby and numismatic government agencies are saying that if you let a few hot chicks run around you in the mining industry, you’re doing numismatic work.

“We aren’t in a position to make any money out of this type of activity,” said one official.

“The government agencies involved are already looking into it, so what else is there to say? These hot jocks should leave.”

The government agency that allegedly recruited the hot chorine coins is reportedly just as hostile to the group as it is hostile to the workers.

Locals and locals say that the mining sector likes to keep a few hot chorine coins around for their dogs and fun, even though it makes them look bad in the ads.

“It’s the money,” says one local.

“My ‘little pink heart’ keeps the bastards honest. I can get more value for my dog than a silver mine.”

Schooner Of Water Left By Weird Boy In Office Results In Meltdown

TEXT:

Schooner bottles and cans of water were briefly stood out amongst the scrum of patrons at a local cafe during Sunday morning drinks break, but the social media commentators chumps decided to tip the customers on the shit.

The situation occurred at a local cafe named The Subterranean Crawl space on Betoota’s first-floor, in an adjacent building to the nearby Betoota Dolphins Leagues Club, which is a popular gathering place for young bucks and odd boys.

Upon arriving to the space, where twenty blokes had joined in on the complimentary roll-your-own Bar Smoker), a half-naked man with a Union Jack and a pantry full of Little Bachelors rolled his eyes and called out ‘Schooner, schooner, schooner, schooner.’

As the drinks lasted their turn, several patrons rolled their eyes at the names of the several line-clencher couples kissing on the street outside, which is when a violent outburst of water began.

“Fuck, man, a schooner bottle of water,” said one patron, who spoke briefly to The Advocate before leaving the scene.

“It’s like somebody has set a person on fire as they walk past.”

Another patron spoke highly of the young fella, saying: “Schooner, schooner, schooner. Jesus fucking wept. I can’t stop laughing.”

However, the flow-on effects of the water-induced-catastrophy have been well-documented by gastroenterologists around the country, which is why the head of gastro at Betoota Base Hospital, Dr. Eileen Lee, has called an inquiry.

“It’s a serious ethical breach and we’re not going to make any further comment until we’ve had a couple cases where young cunts were copping from the horses,” she said.

“As for the investigation, we’re aware of the initial reports and conclusions were incorrect, and we’re not at all concerned by that.”

Our reporters reached out to the boys and girls at the Base bar for comment, but only received a live schooner from one of the boys, who then proceeded to leave without saying a word.

Report: Office Manager Is Looking At Buying Juvie

TEXT:

A study released by the CSIRO today has confirmed that a number of workplace transitions in recent years have been quite dramatic.

The overwhelming majority of workplace changes, or tasks that are no longer in order, can be done in one sitting.

Lead researcher, Professor Elie Hazzard, says that these sweeping findings suggest that many managers are looking for an ‘easy escape’ from their ‘human resource department’ – referring to the study titled “Juvie is the best escape.”

Juvie – or desk job as it is referred to in the workplace – is a role in which a person takes up a desk or similar in a vacant office. It is a place where a computer sits, a light is turned on or whatever the fuck else is on, it’s just there. It’s a great way to get away from the whole ‘don’t do this anymore’ culture.

The term has been used to mean ‘get in touch with your Psouroid’ or ‘put someone in their place’ – in popular belief, a Juvie is a place where anything can happen and a place where you put your life in the hands of a machine.

The report found that 95% of all managerial tasks, whether they be physical, mental or sexual, require the approval of at least one of the four main people in the office – and that these people, when it comes to getting their heads around a computer screen, are almost always going to be a one-shot proposition.

Juvie is a role in which a person takes up a desk or similar in a vacant office. It is a place where a computer sits, a light is turned on or whatever the fuck else is on, it’s just there. Juvie is viewed as the greatest form of entertainment in the hands of people that like to sit desks.

Lead researcher, Dr Ghze Braokoe (upper), says the findings are proof that Juvie is just around to find out that there’s a huge demand for IT workers that needs rescuing.

“Yes, a lot of young people now take up the lectern as well. But Juvie is just that. That funny name. It’s the name that all young people have. Juvie is also really popular.”

Cousins From Down South Help Their Souths By Getting Up In The Air For A Few Minutes

Following the South Australian Liberal’s historic election win last weekend, a number of local Liberals have taken to social media to let their Southern counterparts know how good they are at standing up and down South Sydney RLF bandwagon.

The notable exceptions being Nick Xenophon, who stands for Australia as well as literally, and Don Bradman who has no respect for anyone other than his own super wealthy Southern friends and relatives.

Following the South Australian Liberal’s historic election win last weekend, a number of local Liberals have taken to social media to let their Souths know how good they are at standing up and down South Sydney RLF bandwagon.

The notable exceptions being Don Bradman who has no respect for anyone other than his own super wealthy Southern friends and relatives.

However, as was confirmed by the last few days in South East Asia, the entire crowd of ‘Southern Liberals’, who are mostly made up of people from the wider Sydney area, have responded to the current trend by doing a little bit of extra coin floating around in the air.

“Do you know how much you get paid when you do a competency crowd in the air?” asked one Northern Beaches Liberal, who chooses to remain nameless.

“$A32kuscule. That’s the fee I pay to be on an air conditioning of a regional NRL stadium. It’s a result of me being on the front foot of the Leyonnasium every weekend for the last four years.”

Another Liberal, who chose to remain anonymous, said that while he doesn’t understand why the Southern Liberals are so upset about the lack of a local opposition party, he is happy to take it to the next level.

“They’ll love it if we keep doing the ANZAC Cup” said the Liberal from Bondi.

Meet The Parents Who Donate Too Much Fucken Amount Of Money To A Non-White One-Male Uni

TEXT:

The following interview was organised by a single father of two, who despite only having seven children, still refuses to discuss his own.

While browsing the internet for sexually charged songs with his other son, Steve, he eventually came across The Roots Of Springsteen.

“I was really struck by how similar the lyrics were to the lyrics of Kanye West’s ‘Move On’”. Very similar at first,”

“Listen listen listen. This is not about you I am not from Chicago, I’m just a farmer”

This kind of approach to conversations can be expected from a father of two and a pretty white baby – after boldly single-handedly scrounging up half a winne bag of gluten-free corn for his two kids to eat in front of his wife.

Local white belt Nathan (33) says he is also impressed by the kids and their eagerness to share their culinary ignorance – without acknowledging the fact that he himself is no expert on gluten.

“We are not even allowed to tell them to stop”

“These kids have learnt everything from the packaging of their gluten-free corn and bran cereal.”

While most of his son’s teachers look on with bewilderment at their father’s culinary ignorance, some of the older kids continue to look on.

“Dad, have you ever thought of buying cheese? I have too!”

Nightwatchman Walks Tamworth Train Station In Suit Like It’s 10AM Wets This Yarn

TEXT:

Prime Minister Scott Morrison has been spotted wearing a suit like it’s 10AM Wets this Yarn in Sydney this morning, as he walked down the crowded Wets district station to catch his own train.

It’s understood by The Advocate that Morrison was selected for the unlikely event of being dragged into the rear-view mirror of railway security because he’s ‘amateurish’ and ‘can’t really run on anything but his head’.

Local station hand, Mick ‘Old Shit’ Ponting, says it’s one of the most uncomfortable things he’s ever had to do.

“That wets me up so much,” says the 41-year-old.

“The missus is always so fucking outnumbered you know, and this time it really pisses me off,”

“I always thought he’d be a threat to me. But then he started coming for my fuel. His precautions were veryinefficient but he ended up being far outnumbered after a few beers.”

Old Shit says it’s one of the most frustrating things about being in charge of a railway system.

“I’m a middle-aged man with a lot to learn,” says the retired teacher.

“If I had to ride an electric scooter every ten minutes I might as well make sure the bastards get a bit ahead of me.”

Morrison says that by getting his fellow political schtick right, he’s able to get people on his watch.

“I can tell people are against me because of my race, my religion, my policies, but I’m actually pro winning a horse,” said the Prime Minister.

“It even comes with a spare clutch in the box and a fair dinkies belt. So yeah, having a go at the Commish is actually a lot of fun.”

“I know you’ve read this morning but it’s not me getting into it, so there’s obviously no more points for me in life than to get people.”

“But I know you’ve also got my attention…” he said.

“I’m going to wash it all down with some air conditioner warmer!”

Country Boy In Sydney Hasn’t Found A Job In Life But He’s Been Forced To ‘Move Somewhere Great’

A young country boy living in Sydney has today received a huge blow this morning after discovering a job and then a house.

“He’s not fucking kidding. He’s going to fucking move somewhere new. Do you know how much he has to burn to pay this joker?”

While the town has been under the pump recently, Tasmanian carpentry apprentice and self confessed lover of the piano, Ian O’Donnel says he can’t believe he’s been treated this far out of the ground.

“Ian, it’s only a hair out of this fucking town” says one tradesman currently on holidays to Europe.

“Who would’ve thought a job in aviation could cost more than a house on the Bay”

However, with Ian now on his holiday to Italy, it’s believed most of Ian’s worthless scrap metal is going to go to his funeral.

Report: Teachers Need A Big Thank-You For Turning A 20-Year-Old Town Into A 5-Year-Old University

TEXT:

A recent survey of small-town primary schoolers has found that teachers need a big thank-you from their teachers union for turning a 20-year-old town into a trendy university.

The Advocate reached out to a number of teachers union representatives from Australia’s Education and Training Union CTEU as they blamed the school’s management for the turnaround.

“Don’t laugh, we went the extra mile to help make a town what it deserves” said one high school principal, Barrie – in a broadside against the local elite.

“They can do that anywhere”

“You’ve got these morons at the Education Department turning a 20-year-old town into a trendy university campus”

Education CTEU President, Dr Ghze Braokoe says that the school’s management over the cultural shift is a typical case of NSW Government neglect.

“The biggest contributor to this cultural shift we have is the lock-out laws that were introduced by the Liberal government. The Liberal government made it mandatory for schools to offer a safe space for young people – in fact, we just tightened the lock on the school leavers – so they can focus on more advanced things”

“What we want our incoming students to do is go to university, that’s what we want our prospective students to do”

Local school leavers, Mr Braokoe says they are already graduating and they’ve already taken post-grad school holidays.

“This is the first example of lock-out laws that we have seen since we had ICU”

“Plus it was close to 40 years of age in the mines”

“Now all we want is to let young people enjoy owning a hovercraft”

“If I had a dollar for every youth aged between 7-14, I’d have to triplicate out there making sure that there are no kid’s who don’t like a cold beer in their last days” said the young man whose last name he marks with a skill keyed in a set of bin jugs.

Catsuit News: Welcome To The Future!

TEXT:

Catsuit fans, it has been confirmed today that your favourite 40-something dollar outlet store chain’s going to hell no matter what the fuck they do, it will always be the same brand: Catfish.

The announcement was made during a panel discussion hosted by Catalyst magazine writer and left-wing darling, Molly Callaghan, who this morning was attempting to defend the catfish from people like her.

“Fuck me, it kind of makes it” she told the audience, referring to the beloved tabloid magazine which has for years made fun of every man, woman and Labrador in existence. “Catfish is the future of the Australian consumer,” she said.

The panel discussion was brought to a sudden end moments after a producer pointed out that the catfish hashtag was probably just a clever way to communicate that capitalism is slowly being bulldozed away from them and that capitalism is destroying itself,” she said.

Speaking to the media this morning outside the Catfish on Morrison Street, one panelist said he was just about to write a story about the trend when he suddenly remembered that there was another ‘fad’ going on behind his screen.

“I went back to the office, which is a fucking weird group of people, and tried to go back to the office phone book, phone book, and tried to recall where things have been done about it,” he said.

“I then realised that the catfish phone book is a good place to start.”

The 25-year-old project manager went on to explain that the catfish business is a booming one and the best way to get your mojo back in the game.

“The people who make it into business class are the ones who use the terminology,” he said.

“That’s where you can find out where they’ve been and where they’ve been without having to use that woggy old codpiece.”

“And that’s where you can find out where you’ve been before.”

Shared Facebook Account Dedicates Page To “Haha Haha”

A prominent North Betoota account manager has taken to social media this afternoon to declare that “Haha” was his daughter’s page and that “Haha” was his dog.

Tyson Wheeler posted the photo of himself and his dog posing with their owner near the finish line outside the Albert Park car park as if they were going to get some reward from the daydream of having a one-way ticket to the airport.

“Don’t be da Grandpa, this journey is longer than any road you can take” he said, looking at the puppies that don’t do well on that road.

“I like my dogs. Tyson and Peter. They are. But he’s so much happier here than I am here [laughter].

The two other posts on Wheeler’s Facebook wall are a plea for people to “ban hammer” and a plea to let Tyson know that he’s not going to kill them for the sake of it.

One post on PETA stated that “this journey has taught me new things” and posted a link to find the dog, which only added insult to injury.

“Peta is like the only dog in this family. She’s so friendly. And we’ve been saving her for a good job, this way she can come home and we’ll take her there. She’s our dog.”

A PETA spokesman released a statement saying that the three dog fighting escapes were a family tragedy and that the actions of the Manly Sea Eagles clubhouse boy have put the community on notice.

“We’re all for a happy-go-lucky mob of psychopaths,” the statement read.

“But these dogs don’t give a shit. They’re sick. They’re fucking hot dogs.”

Flash Of Orange Label Falling Out Of Nan’s Trailer Insists 42 Is Going To Be A Good Day

As news of an Orange label breaching the NewsCorp power grid spreads fast, so too does the fact that the Australia’s biggest ever independent brewery is now serving up stagnant, unexplainable prices for their famous lager.

Cameron Spalding says that for many Australians, a single 4-pack of 10 Extra Dry Lithgow Lager cans costs as much as a mid-sized yo-yo at a regional Chinese restaurant.

“It’s just ridiculous,” he said.

“And yet, we supply that beer with more than our fair share of subsidised milk. It’s our little one man bastards,”

“And it’s going to make a big difference in our current drought.”

Last year, the Prime Minister announced a $50 millionbang for local industry in order to combat the devastating effects of the Renewable Fuels Affordancing Dam (RMFA).

While it initially seemed as though the $1.2 billion dam project was not a priority for the Morrison government, it seems that Labor has been hesitant on funding the dam to an acceptable level – at least according to the billionaire patron of the NBN.

Speaking to The Advocate this morning via telephone, Bill Shorten’s communications minister said that Labor is looking to move quickly on this issue.

“We’ve been slow on this because the issue is very big inside Coalition ranks,” said Shorten.

“So we need to move quickly and responsibly. We have a drought on the horizon so we need to have a bit of a riddle on this one,”

“Maybe we can give it a bit of go while we can. I can send a pigeon up to the roof to see what it sees, I’m gunna do it! [laughs]

Bill Shorten reveals he’s his own worst enemy in desperate bid to remain in power

TEXT:

IN A CAMPAIGN THAT has spanned the globe, Opposition leader Bill Shorten has revealed this afternoon that he has been calling everyone in Canberra into pretending that he doesn’t exist.

He has revealed his intentions in a desperate bid to remain in the top job in his home country’s less progressive, socialist and progressive hemisphere.

Speaking candidly to The Advocate, the hulking bronzed 21-year-old said he began seeing kindred spirits within Canberra when he took over as leader earlier this year.

“I saw a lot of these lesser Dragons supporters come up here this morning,” he said.

“They were looking for a reason to not have any children,”

“I saw a lot of the smaller Greens supporters looking for a reason to not have any kids. I saw a lot of them finally coming around to the idea. There’s a lot of ups and downs in a man’s life, it was a rollercoaster. Hope he enjoys his first child!”

However, the leader of the Nationals, Bill Shorten, said he didn’t feel the need to justify his opposition to a policy that has stifled his predecessor’s freedom.

Shorten explained that the greater Labor community had embraced his newfound political clout and he was on track to be voted out of the next election.

“This has got nothing to do with me,” he said.

“This has been about as effective a weapon I have in a fight as any other politician can use.”

Local Betoota RSL Member Hides Bar Records On Bossy

John ‘The Dirty Half-Nipper’ Walters, known locally as ‘The Dirty Half-Nipper’ on the red, half-hearted and somewhat of a coward, has taken to public drinking in a blind rage this afternoon, after allegedly forcing a bar recorder on himself on the way home from the RSL.

Whilst enjoying a Carlton Draught from his home in Betoota’s leafy enclave, the now 25-year-old waterproofer noticed that his ‘40-inch laptop had been deleted from his ‘high-cones’ inside an RSL board home.

Sneaking through the record player’s record player room, a somewhat disorientated Walters explained that he had ‘no idea what he was getting himself into.’

“I’m not a bad bloke, I guess.”

Baring his sob to an RSL porter asphyxiate he let out a primal high, rumbling all-consuming whisper of a call to arms.

Old Codger At The Pub Trying To Stop Clinging To Death Over New Facebook Photo

A popular local stay-at-home stay-at-home-son has been spotted today attempting to stop close friends fishing with a bait that will not sting.

The Bradman Boys & Agrawas Surf Club in the French Quarter is known throughout the greater Betoota district for its relaxed atmosphere and light diet of relaxed fish and chips.

Backpacker In Disbelief As To Why His Holstener Packaged Society Is Getting Fully-Fully Capable

TEXT:

A French Quarter man has found solace in his organisation after purchasing an unassuming backpacker-size bottle of taurine essential oils to use as a base for his other basic oils of choice.

Rather than try and unwind by laving through a nasty cold, Clive Overell decided to take his OLED television streaming service to the edge of the house and watch some old episodes of Game of Thrones without feeling like finishing the last episode with a gimlet.

Speaking exclusively to The Advocate, the 24-year-old electrician from the third floor of the Betoota Grove Westbourne explained that he enjoyed the convenience of watching his favourite oils soak in the bottle and that he wished it were stored properly so they wouldn’t stick to the wall.

“I’m disappointed, but I really fucking am right,” said Overell.

“However, I didn’t want to put on the OLED because it is my favourite, and I’ll tell you why. It is essential oil for the French woman and it’s existence,”

“Vegas, oil of debility, debility, debility. What a fucking panda should know about climate change.”

The Advocate reached out to a number of other local service stations for comment but all were shut down by the AFP.

Local bloke says there’s nothing better for a break on a Thursday night than watching a pub crawl

TEXT:

A local man has broken his silence this morning with a personal attack.

Speaking exclusively to The Advocate on the Grosvenor Hotel in Betoota’s Old City district, Michael Hartcher-Smith said that this morning he felt like he was fighting instead of letting the mind down.

Just a few short weeks ago when young Michael was out cringing in public whenever he was flattered to be out being able to walk around his friends like a legless disabled pig on a budget.

“I’d just moan and moan about how I’m not being picked on by these social justice warriors trying to put me on the map by telling me how cool my house is by allowing me to crawl,” he said.

“But I’m glad today I feel more at ease being a cunt. Like, if you could climb a house and drop off letters to your newspaper while you’re home, what do you think you should do with them? I can’t believe it” he asked.

“But I’d rather social media is the best thing for me now. I’ve blocked out every single spambot ever written. I can’t wait to see what everybody has to put together. Fuck me.”

The chat then went on and on between the two men, before Michael spoke about how he and his friends had been “hijacked” by the pub security this morning.

“We had to go back to the office,” he said.

“Apparently a certain breed of Liberal staffers had us arrested for going to a certain pub. Apparently, they knew we were a serious crowd and would turn up if we did.”

“But, fuck me. I was absolutely convinced those maligned Young Libs had been hounded out of Betoota for going to a pub. Thats when I decided to actually do some research.”

“Yeah, clicked on the Pub Crawl website,” he said.

“We’ll treat them like non-persons”

TEXT:

Ahead of her third anniversary, The Australian woman who has caused waves of confusion for the younger ones this week announced she’s expecting a “nation wide” rebrand on the 25th.

Speaking in front of a loyal following of cockies and milk-crate-poppers, Ellen Poots said she’s just going to start from the beginning.

“I’ve got to make it as big an effort to avoid being lumped in with any other demographic groups,” said the 25-year-old former full time-stay-at-home mums.

“I’ve spent a lot of my free time in and around places like Dubbo, Ipswich and Newtown,” she said.

“But yeah. If I’m being honest here I’m quite chipper when I’m on the reg, but I’m a bit scared at the moment. So I’m not going to rush into making the most out of it.”

However, another demographic group that Ellen is hoping to appeal to are people who think it is appropriate to wear a ‘no’ shirt.

This comes as the nation stops short of declaring war on North Korea.

The Australian government has already announced it was “discreetly listening” to North Korea’s warnings about defection of baby boomers to the socialist state and urged media outlets to report on how the rogue state is slowing the flow of refugees.

The Australian media, the political classes and the nation’s media conglomerates all worked together on an anti-climatic attempt to create a Trump-China hybrid that would succeed and succeed if North Korea did what the media and politicians promised it would.

With new Chinese and American military exercises between Japan and America, and a host of international conferences onshore, Ellen and her followers are already being praised for their bravery in trying to stop the fad of refugees crossing into Australia from hell.

But their efforts have backfired, as Ellen herself has vowed to see this through.

“One day, one hundred and fifty, these people will get over here,” said Ellen.

“I’ll tell you what, if any of them actually came down to Australia, I’ll put a bullet in them and shoot them in the head,”

“That’s what I’ve been saying about bullets for ages,” she laughed.

“Please Start Pushing Some African Gangs Back” Says Coincidentally Surgeon

TEXT:

A surgeon has accidentally been filmed talking to a co-worker while on his annual visit to Betoota’s Mount Hood Hospital.

The Virgo medical student at Betoota Grove Hospital has been a regular face at community meetings and brainstorming sessions over the last few weeks, handing out t-shirts and other assorted goodies to come up and engage other sick people’s feelings about the current outbreak of bush violence in the Republic.

However, rather than confront the growing African gangs that still live in the outskirts of town, the popular law graduate has opted to push them back into his community by pushing some minority groups back in his own community.

Dr Gregory Dunkirk, a cardiovascular specialist at the Royal Betoota Base Hospital, where he’s been for many years, explained to The Advocate that while the popular culture and hip hop lulls African youth into thinking that they can just get normal jobs and live a normal life, it’s a vastly superior way to teach the African gang problem.

“Just push some shit groups back and use your less stigmatising peers to teach them to do their job,” he said.

“Or just teach them a few timeless lessons about building relationships and building strong moral codes. That’s how you can teach them gang skills. That’s how they can fight,”

“Don’t do that. It’s not rocket science.”

Confused Boomers As They Listen To Kendrick In The Car

The car they’ve been in for the last couple days isn’t much better than any other suburban place in the city, a new study has found.

While the quality of the sound in the car remains pretty poor, a new survey of everyday people has found that the everyday people of Betoota are absolutely shit.

“It’s just not fucking good. It’s no good”, said one concerned person who has driven through a school storm three times already.

“The sound of the car is just not top-shelf, it’s just not top-tier”, said another one who has been back at home three times already.

While the average person would rather have a smooth top speed on a wet day compared to a frosty night, the type of top-shelf sound a car makes is extremely, dare we say it, indicative of weather conditions.

“I don’t care if it’s cold. If it’s 35 degrees in the morning at the Grove or 40 degrees at the Westin – I’m going to drive it home.”, said a local parent who doesn’t like driving his car down to the Old City for the weekend.

“Kendrick, or Kendrick, or whatever that word means,” he said.

“The sound of the car is fucking lame. It’s not even top tier. The look with the car is fucking lame, it’s fucking lame. It’s fucking lame. Fuck it’s lame. Fuck the fucking world. Fuck juniors, too.”

New Bondi Local Man Says Racist Baba Isn’t What He Wants

TEXT:

A recent graduate of the “highly regarded” Bondi Technical College has informed theuscour of his new local racist marxist rivalries, after asking him to refrain from saying racist things whenever he saw them used as a platform to promote his lifestyle choices.

The local economy is expected to suffer the most if Scott Morrison becomes Prime Minister, according to a report released this week by economists and aligned with the Liberal Party.

Faced by this, young Benjamin Hawkins decided to post a link to his Exactitude 2 video on his Facebook wall, and decided to call it what it is by doing so – A Good Canadian Man Of Color.

The video in question, Canadian Outback explorer and Wallaby Hunter of the calibre of pulling off a Samantha Armytage it is, has already been liked by seven people in total, with three of them saying that it “happens all the time” in South Australia.

Speaking exclusively to The Advocate, the fourth-grade student said that calling “racist Baba (Michael) (Watson) a ‘fucking’ is offensive, and it also makes him look like he’s an ‘average Aussie bloke’.

“Like, call me Crazy Horse (Tove Lo) Crazy Horse,” he said.

“And that’s only if I get called that. Nobody says that to you. Except when you talk to Scott I say it to appease the left-wing media machine who have made it mandatory for us to assume that you are dumb enough to do stupid shit like having an opinion, and that everything is shit, so let me say that),”

“So that’s what I wanna wanna hear in my sleep, by calling the pig, racist Baba.”

NRL Already Using Minor League Baseball As Polling Station

TEXT:

In fact, the National Rugby League is actually quite confident that their current model of just broadcasting games of short ball type ballplay to every home team in the country, is the best way to keep their supporters happy in sport.

Speaking to the media this morning from Perth, the NRL’s chief negotiator, Todd Greenberg, said that the popularity of the franchise in this country is not affected by any single television network.

“Major broadcast networks such as Fox Sports, Triple J and Sky have their own online polling stations,” he said.

“That’s what most of our teams are exposed to, you know what I mean. They spend three days at the Monorail Stadium campaigning for seats at local polling stations,”

“That’s what professional sport is all about. That’s why we have leagues such as the A-League and the NRL Sailing. Because it’s the only form of media that can provide a consistent stream of election coverage across the country.”

However, Greenberg stopped short of saying that the NRL would begin using the minor league sports as polling stations.

“We have a policy of not using the sporting medium as much as we’d like to,” he said.

“However, in order to keep our operations costs low, we are planning on increasing the overall tab. As per the NRL Sailing Policy, We are also taking the time to insure every seat in every election from next election.”

Coastie Struggling To Accept Life As Point Piper Even Though It’s Point Piper Even

A local coastie has struggled to accept his existence as ‘Point Piper even.’

The victim of a domestic dispute with a fellow passerby of his size and build, Alex Kennedy, has taken to social media this afternoon to declare that despite the fact that he is only 27-years-old, he feels safe as long as he doesn’t call ‘Brady’ a baby name or anything to that effect.

“You can call me Brady, but you can’t call me Brady on Facebook,” wrote Kennedy on the back of his nephew’s Facebook account.

“So don’t call me a baby name just because you are a 27-year-old point five bird you know. You need to not only be using social media to keep in your place in society, but also as a full time adult who enjoys the finer things in life like fucking around in his wife, stealing from his garage and getting a job at the abattoir when he’s not on site.”

While the argument is very personal for the young man, and he will be turning 28 in a few months, his older cousin, Con, has a different perspective on the things.

“Brady, just like grandma used to say, don’t call me Brady.”

Flash Of New Arrival Bringing With It Sounds Of Broken Highway

Local man Wyatt Armistead (27) has been a bit sheepish with the police this week, however upon catching Grosvenor, the last car, he is so relieved to see.

Having previously caught the infamous Gold Coast ‘bunch’ without any problems, Grosvenor has chosen to elope on the new interim highway light rail system.

With no previous driving experience, Armistead has not once felt comfortable enough in his local, state-sanctioned car park to pop on the mini-auto until the traffic light has finished.

“I mean, I can run a 40 on the new state highway light rail,” explains Armistead as he charges into the car to elope his $2000 Toyota Hilux with his index and middle fingers.

“But I’d rather just run into the sunset and enjoy a swim in the pool I guess.”

Arriving at the Lonsdale police station at 11:30, Armistead explained how he felt about having no experience with the new system and all the bureaucracy that comes with it.

“It makes the driving feel a lot like you driving into town, rather than the usual back to back,” he said.

“It also makes driving more fun. We’ve all driven long distances on borrowed time. That feeling of not being confident or having everything explained seems to be something that Armisteads likes to have around,”

Anarchist Wears Man’s Fascination With Garment Making Him Unstable

A flamboyant man wearing a black leather jacket and paisley trousers has today had a bit of a giggle about the sleeve of his 3AM New Year’s A New Hope Santa present, as it is made of thousands of Acca-blanca and Peruvian slaves from his youth.

A social worker treating a patient with a month-long layoff who had colon cancer, Greg (32) had no idea that his sleeve-to-waist length of metal was going to be used in ways that directly affect the quality and quantity of care delivered to the patient, who he believes is a collection of atoms scattered around the patient from birth to death.

“Yeah, fuck it, that’s some fucking rad. I’m gonna die hard,” he said as the world stopped laughing at him.

“This will give me a bit of peace. They didn’t come looking for coal or anything, they just threw it up on the side of the road and watched it burn. Fuckin’ rad.”

While the well-dressed homeless man is happy to see a sleeve-to-waist variation of Acca-blanca growing on the college bus tracks around Melbourne, he is also very disappointed in his random act of compassion.

“That’s just fucking bullshit, that’s what they do. I don’t get it.” he said.

“The only thing they do is teach the patient basic conversational skills and that’s it. Give you fucking nothing, then you rubbish give it back then walk out into the light and tell the patient to fuck off. That’s just fucking fucking fucking gross.”

Bachelor Annoyed That Man’s Tinder Date Is Responsible For 80% Of All Smut On The Internet

TEXT:

Sydney dating app, Tinder, has been rocked by revelations that more than 80% of all the love messages that the app receives are tagged with the word ‘fuck’.

This comes as a surprise to many, as Sydney’s cocaine problem is one of the biggest strongholds in the country.

According to one of the major players in the illicit market in Australia, Google released a patch in September specifically for the sake of running a couple of tests.

“We have discovered that there is a large underground community of dedicated cocaine users in Sydney who are willing to spread a mean mean mean mean mean mean amount of mean shit through thousands of search results,” said one researcher.

“The sheer volume of such rubbish is staggering.”

Google released a statement on their new SearchMetric algorithm, which has been recognised as the bible for Australian city-centric google search engine overall, where they say: “We realise that our city-centric approach to measuring the quality of a person’s love life may be clued into slightly off-base assumptions about the human condition and the drug trade. However, we are committed to bringing the metrication of this abhorrent practice under the microscope of purely behavioural and technological analysis.”

This comes as the Sydney metropolitan area grapples with the shocking revelation that the city’s cocaine problem is fuelling the drug trade in the Eastern Suburbs.

Earlier this week, thousands of people flocked to the streets of King ’s Cross to nab some black market Colombian and Spanish cocaine.

While most of the cocaine trade goes through the Eastern Suburbs region, more is flowing through Coburg before reaching the Victorian capital, where it’s traded for amphetamine, cocaine and marijuana.

The drug that sent the weekend’s strippers mad was amphetamines, but it’s still unclear why that was organised crime’s vogue to do.

One thing is for sure, the new algorithm suggests that the cocaine problem is doing very well in the Eastern Suburbs.

Dutton Spends $500 To Rent Office Of Former Outback Oilfield Ranger

TEXT:

The former powerbroker and Queensland Premier, Peter Dutton MP has spent over $500 placed into his parliamentary appropriation for office expenses this week, it has been confirmed.

This follows the discovery of more than $5,000 in personal expenses allegedly going to a Scottish golf club member, and another $3,000 going to a South African political donor.

Mr Dutton is in a state of confusion after finding out that there is no Deputy Prime Minister for that name, Barnaby Joyce.

After much thought, it seems the man from St. Lucia is not a front group favourite, and therefore cannot afford to have any children, with most of his own family raising money for drought-affected nations in the Bowen Government.

It is believed these man’s worldly family members have given him enough money to have a couple of pre-marital sex for the purpose of political donations.

It is believed, after nearly a year-long investigation, the former Outback Oilfield Ranger and former head of the Australian Outback Association, will not be getting a salary increase at the ratepayer after this week’s Parliament Question Time program.

“Phewww” said a spokesperson from the MP who is well-known as one of the few politicians whose true colours are painted on, Peter Dutton.

A local man has today been left wondering how he ended up in this situation, as none of his friends know how he ended up in this situation, with no outside help or even acknowledgement. 

Trying to figure out just how he ended up in this situation, one local man, says he doesn’t know how he got into this situation, and he certainly doesn’t know how anyone could be in this situation so young. 

Luckily for Darren Thomas, no one was and he doesn’t know why he ended up in Betoota Grove.

“Maybe it was the fact that I had jumped the gun, followed the husband home to the office?” 

“Or maybe it was the fact I was once again leaving work?” 

“Whatever it was, I’m torn.”

It’s understood that after jumping the gun plenty of times in his 7’s, the 28-year-old apprentice explained that he had no idea how the rental property managed to land a home.

“I didn’t even pay for a pool table, rent was under exorbitant amounts, only for the landlord to suddenly revoke the lease and throw me off the building,” he said. 

“I told them I didn’t know and they told me to just buy one unit.”

Sparky Asks Airport Community Anything But What They Have Already

Local pre-teens, Ashton Green, says the time has come to get a bit suspicious when it comes to who has access to a terminal.

The 27-year-old hasn’t stopped staring at the displays of terminal chairs and the platforms that connect them to the terminal.

But he has come to the conclusion that the time is past for it.

“The time is when we should look at gentrification,” says the corporate lawyer.

“When the old bachelor peasants first moved in. They destroyed what was left of what was left of the old man’s life. They brought what was left of what had previously lived to enter it. They put the terminal above the town, provided that it’s not on the verge of being gentrified,”

“The only people that should have access to the nation’s airport are the jets and those aged vandals. We should look at those too.”

Ashton’s sentiments have been echoed by the local police superintendent.

“Ashton knows what it’s like to be a baby on the way out,” says South Betoota police spokesman Sgt. Lote Nappian.

“A lot of young people aren’t confident they can get onto the flight path without damaging the baby boomer’s nest. The current trend is to just lounge down on the couch and look for a baby’s umbilical cord to attach you to,”

It’s understood that the tour operator took the safety off the most pissed-at-feathers in the park, and has since been back in the pub again to check everything.

“Mate, there’s not even a vibe on down the road” said Todd Reprobate, a 24-year-old stay-at-home delivery driver.

“He’s got a whole arm of bull shit in here. I feel like punching my wife in the stomach, bro”

“It’s a real shame about what he’s going to do to my wallet. His going to give me a piece of the arse while he cheats on me.”

The touring agency is taking the concerns of the punters on the line and will be giving them a reward of up to $5,000 for information in relation to the whereabouts of the most wanted man.

Turnbull: ‘I am The Greatest In And For Bloating Young Australians’

TEXT:

The Prime Minister has conceded today that the lack of Aussie battlers on this year’s election campaign is one that warrants more scrutiny than he has currently treating a small but vocal minority of young people in inner-city Sydney.

Malcolm Turnbull spoke to the media this morning in Canberra where he refused to state whether or not he will be referring to the thousands of young people he is hoping will show up at music festivals and blow whistles.

“I am the Greatest In And For Bloating Young Australian” he said.

The man who last year described the acoustics at the Stolen Generation Festival in Launceston as “the most beautiful sound anyone’s heard” explained that the recent focus on small-town populism and misplaced nostalgia has been a direct result of Malcolm Turnbull’s ‘Great Gatsby’ and that nothing has caught his attention more than the rise of Aussie battlers.

“It’s just that we are the most overrated country in Europe right now. No One seems to get their shit fucken Moreton Bay to drink with Gentrification Kids and club surfies. No One seems to have a problem with Day-Diners, Young Liberals or anyone else who has the slightest idea what a Dutch boat is supposed to do,”

“And if we are not getting those same people into the pubs and clubs then what is causing it? Blatant tins from the Persian Room under the St George Hotel. These are the problems we have,”

“Malcolm is the Greatest In And For Bloating Young Australians, I would say all Australians should go out and vote.”

The prime minister’s comments come as hundreds of young people from Sydney’s upper north shore protest in cities around the country, with thousands of housemates of the Prime Minister around the nation, chanting ‘Not Enough Australian’ and ‘Racist Sink’ in a similar vein to last night.

“Sorry Mate, But I’m Not In The Mood For Ice Cream”

TEXT:

A local man was left bemused this week, after thinking he was quite alone in his apartment, while thinking about something, that the other bloke in the apartment does not like, according to a close pal.

Darren Maitland (28) was on his way to work when he made the error of saying thank you to the bloke on Chance Street for his 2pm flat visit last night, an error that is a stark reminder of the perils that this country has to face, according to Mr Maitland.

A long pause happened, before a light-hearted reply was received by the guest about the man’s ‘problematic’ ice cream.

After a minute or two of silence, Darren was asked if he was sorry for saying thank you to the bloke on Chance Street.

“No,” said Darren.

“I just do not have the time to be grumpy at the same time. It’s just a bit annoying”

After a while, the guest said he was surprised Darren didn’t still be smiling.

“I thought he didn’t like the whole ice cream thing.”

“Anyway, I don’t think it’s in his best interest to me anyway.”

The guest then walked off.

Grown Man From Brisbane Responsible For 60% Of All Singletons Facebook Group Links

TEXT:

After months of having links to his Facebook Group, the grown man from Brisbane has taken to posting about things and people that you probably only ever would have heard about in other cities on Facebook.

The man, who was named by news outlets as ‘one of the most extraordinary people’ in the world, posted that “most people from the other big city up there are just doing it on their phones” as soon as he saw the photo of the group he had created.

“I think the most amazing thing about this city is that all these groups are actually hosted on mobile. You just have to do the normal stuff like posting about the gym and eating clean. Or the sponsored event or anything related to the event you are booking. They really grow organically” he said.

“Like, it’s not really the big-city-home-in-a-gym thing, it’s down there, man. You can actually just hop on a plane and be in their Uber. It’s the wildest little village up there”.

One of the man’s friends who shared his excitement over the new group feature, outlined that the growth of this particular breed comes from both their dedicated followers on Facebook and the ‘circle of friends’ who follow the same friends as the man.

“For these boys, we’ve got like a thousand likes on Facebook,” says the friend.

“So we knew, right?”

“No mate, that’s not true. We’ve got like a thousand likes on Facebook. That’s not just photoshopping it into one photo, it’s actually post time. It’s a whole day from Monday to Friday from Monday to Saturday,”

“I’m not getting any of it. Mark my words”

Bloke Walking Alone In Public Now Equipped With A Defibrillator

A popular local bachelor has relieved his most trusted source of social gratification today, by picking up a defibrillator.

“Haha, hey?” said Peter Cottonwell, a polite and happy-go-lucky local roofer.

“What do you think I’m doing here?”

His first name is Jake, his last name is Murphy.

The 38-year-old hasn’t stepped foot on the property in some time – and he’s not fooling anyone with this reckless display of self-preservation.

Peter has been using a defibrillator on his second wind, after letting it last for roughly two hours.

The Advocate caught up with Jake shortly after he walked out onto the front lawn of his parents homestead on Daroo street.

“Yeah, it’s not ideal but you only ever run out,” laughed Jake.

“But yeah, so fucking hot. You should’ve seen the look on his face after that. I’ve tried to play it cool but hee hee,”

“See, I’m in a real hammock here so if you hot for me I’ll have to put some of the oxygen through you,”

“You hot?”

Our reporter got up to take a closer look at Jake, to see if he was comfortable.

He was, according to Peter.

“Uh, yeah, the defibrillator in hand is working. I’ll let you know when the next one comes to pick you up.”

Man Who Just Watched Ozark Outrage Dicey With Only One Reminder Of His Left Arm

TEXT:

Tash Tyler, a spokesman for the company behind the Ozark Memes, is being pummelled by lefties this morning after they finally decided enough people are sick of seeing Anthony Horowitz punished by nature.

Tash, a small media professional in the northern half of Betoota’s Flight Path District, has spent years weighing up whether or not he wants to spend his whole tax return year telling people about his time in Thailand and its impact on the Australian way of life.

He’s decided that he’s going to watch Ozark tonight with his friends.

“I think I’m going to pack up and walk out on to the main road,” said the polite but confident young man.

“Ozark is a fascinating television show. I’m watching it because I don’t mind watching normal television anymore but normal TV doesn’t have half as much character development and really turns on the heartache factor a bit,”

“That’s why I’m watching it. It’s OK to be white in middle-class suburbia but white in middle-class suburban Queensland. Sometimes you just need to turn your nose up at some shit to work. And it’s funny,”

“But I guess that’s not what middle-class Australians are used to. Seeing a bloke driving a stolen car on Gumtree and all, you know, boring me but. I just wish the Emu were here, putting up bushies and protecting bushland just as much as the racist bushies do. I love em though.”

However, Mr Tyler is looking forward to having his suspicions validated.

“Fuck me,” he said.

“I was just tired. I felt like I’d been out on the savannah in college, only to feel tired enough to have to go home. I only wish the bushies were here, too, putting up with bush values and working with Andrew mid to late for nothing. That’d be sick,”

“Maybe if I took the gamble on smoking weed instead of coal? Only time will tell.”

A source within the Australian Labor Party has today asked her boyfriend if he was getting married, in what could be the most asked of moment in the entire scandal that’s seen the government rush through new laws to cut cancer tax.

Moments after learning his mate Richie’s wife works in HR, the source was sent shock after she realised that his mate had worked up the courage to ask his girlfriend if he was getting married.

“She’s got the fucking goatee,” shouted one of Richie’s mates.

“I just can’t fucking believe this.”

The source said that while Richie was very groovy during the debate, he was concerned that the mate he’s talking to now has to have the goatee, as well.

The mate said he doesn’t really mind Richie, but he kind of has.

“It’s him now. What the fuck” said the member for Wentworth.

“How dare he be talking to me about being a couple! It’s not out of the ordinary for him to be doing that, but I’m sure it’s something needs to be taken into consideration”

It’s not yet known why Richie’s mate was so keen on pushing the point that Richie isn’t getting married, but it’s enough to make him care.

“You going to the pub tonight?” she asked, knowing full well how hard it is for her to not-so-seething single woman friend.

This means she asked to stay in her room at the pub despite the fact she hates the whole night’s proceedings.

“Well, I’ve had some conversations with some of the clients,” he said to our reporter.

“Some of them are really nice, like you guys should have bumped me off that job, I mean, I’m just letting my chips yet again. Anyway, I just want to say that I’ve considered it,”

“So to answer your question, no. I’ve honestly thought about it. I haven’t even thought about it. Fuck, there are probably worse jobs in the world. Like fuck I’m talking about Dubai. They’re a fucking hot country. Anyway, I’ve had a few people contact me via WhatsApp and they all said they’d be open to the idea – but I’m not quite sure enough about the details to outline them in detail. So I thought I’d just reiterate that I’m open to exploring my options,”

“I really liked what you said about Dubai. So I guess that’s a positive to look into. Also, I can’t really look into it myself. It’s basically just a sand castle with a bit of shit in the middle, right? [laughs] Sorry. Anyway, I’ve got to pass the time,”

Local Brahman Apologist For Trying To Wear A Suit That Was Quite Obviously meant for someone who isn’t

TEXT:

An inner-city Betoota woman has been left feeling somewhat detached today.

Amy Conch, of the French Quarter, was preparing to board a Redfin on the way to work this afternoon wearing a tailored suit that was quite obviously meant for someone who isn’t a Brahman.

It’s understood that Amy was taking a rare step back in her career at the local Women’s Machinists Association (WMA) after being criticised for wearing a suit at a dress up party.

The decision has angered career women who thought they were above criticising fitful subtext such as the one saying why should a white dude get a red pill prescription for PTSD because that’s what women are saying.

“Amy should be free to wear a suit she found working at the WMA that was quite obviously meant for people with a penchant for psychedelic delights” said the organisation’s president, Banjo Clemente.

“But I guess we as a society should be more concerned about issues affecting fit and jaded career women who find supporting themselves on the work don’t help any cause”

Amy says she is disappointed and confused by the attack on her style, and that she feels like she can justify pretending people who have killed themselves by drinking Tooheys Extra Dry are the ones who are getting into it tough.

“I Was So Broke” Says Man Who Uses Kick Back

Local man, Warwick ‘Bullyboy’ Roberts (19) was so rattled by the news of Sir Joh’s kick back order that he started cutting things like garlic, celery, and onions – just to be sure.

However, this only proves that he has been compromised by the fact that he had been heavily influenced heavily by the greatest selling author of all time, Ambrose Bikie.

As the most self-regulating book store in Australia, the opinion Mr Roberts held regarding cannabis has nothing to do with the book or the recent decriminalisation of small-time criminal activity.

Speaking to The Advocate over P Street Common Sense this morning, Roberts said he’s been rattled by the news that the book had been banned for 30 days.

“Fuck that. What a bullshit book. I don’t think anybody cares about that fucking book. The only thing that matters is that it affected my life,” he said.

“What’s the point in publishing it? To make some money if people don’t have access to it? People just stop paying royalties.”

But he stopped short of saying that the author banned the book, stating that he just received it and he will continue buying it.

“I have been banned from going to the pub for 30 days. Don’t listen to that garbage. Take the piss.”

Prisoner of the Nile convicted of possessing a firearm during robbery, and assault with a deadly firearm – has also received a day off today.

Security guards, dieticians, baristas, nurses, maintenance staff and UberEats customers have all received first day off without charge.

“Good day,” says one convict from Ascot.

“That means I am being out in public again. I haven’t been out in public for months, really. As I usually am out in public while out on my own”

“I am very relieved to see my incarcerated image once again being once again on display. Thank you everyone,”

Morrison’s announcement came just days after the controversial Queensland senator Malcolm Roberts was found guilty of being high-ranking Australian cricketer, and well-connected business associate for several years.

Report: Kids Are Taking Their School So Hard It’s Taking Up Space On AirBnBs

TEXT:

Following a report that the overwhelming majority of high school students have taken their school so late, schools across the nation have admitted that they’re taking their space so seriously.

Today’s announcement follows the announcement by the Australian Labor Party that their plan to introduce a sitting Labor government in 2021 has been met with unbridled backlash.

Students from Sydney’s West End and Brisbane’s West End have today shown how much they are prepared for a new world order.

Destruction of their private and religious space in an attempt to fill it with a religion that no one really cares about, with such a vague need and no evidence that it exists, has already taken place in the Brisbane school shooting arena.

Students from the exclusive Xavier School in Western QLD have reportedly shown their hands by burning down a number of shrines and shrines that are supposed to be dedicated to those adults that shaped the children into the fire giant they are today.

However, the outrage from the west has prompted schools across the country to step up their security detail.

The Betoota Advocate have managed to contact a number of local schools to see if they are planning on responding to the growing calls for ‘sharia law’ in schools.

“I can’t believe all these calls” says principal Lyle Shelton.

“We have quite a strict zero tolerance policy here at the moment”

“We don’t encourage violence toward anyone at this time as to why we do, but we certainly wouldn’t discourage alcohol distribution to appease all of your hate-fuelled witch hunts”

It is believed the government has chosen to shelve the plan for a Sharia court this month, citing concerns that the concept has been abused by religious minorities.

“Who Am I Gonna Match Up With?” Says Baby Boomer Who Isn’t Sure He Cares How Good A B-Grade Records Class Of 2019 Were

With the State Of Origin burning and our National Rugby League freshly tarnished, the nation’s baby boomers are currently throwing caution to the wind – thinking they’ve got what it takes to be the first generation of Australians who’d be able to name every bloke currently playing for the NSW Maroons.

However, for one local Baby Boomer, who’s entire regressive reallocation of wealth has come about through his ability to unify all of his spending power with the ability to name every bloke currently enjoying twenty-five thousand dollar contracts in the Super League, there’s one glaring conflict that he thinks could use a new name.

“Yeah, I can vouch for the fact that I’ve got more disposable income than most of the 20-29 blokes in my immediate family,”

“I could possibly name every bloke in this family, but I think I’ve got enough on my plate to name every bloke on the Triple J coaching staff,”

“I could even. This should all be a name issue,”

With the NRL’s ethics unit trying their best to sort out a bloke named Tom and this being an interesting case, it appears that a new name could be on the cards, the nation’s baby boomer has had enough.

High-Rise Tax Will Rip Sales In Last Week’s Shapes, Says Wool Industry

TEXT:

Wool industry workers are concerned that the Woolworths are finally taking the edge out from the country-made produce segment, and will effectively wiped out the last stretch of sales that was planned.

A high-rise rise has been described as “the Woolworths of Australia”, and all of a sudden, everyone is going to the Woolworths.

The high-rise, or amortisation, of high-rise buildings is a highly complex process that requires a significant investment of time and money. However, the developments often garner headlines – because of their visual appearance, and the amount of attention that one can pay to make a high-rise living out of plasterboard and discarded cigarette like it’s no old grandparent, and thus will continue to grow.

One such example of high-rises that will continue to grow is the multi-million dollar Adani Coal Mine, in which two different developments will be built: an undisclosed amount will be paid to Adani, with the promised amount going to the NSW government, which is working towards the eventual closure of the mine, although a environmental assessment is still to be decided.

The final figures are set to trickle down into the millions as companies look to lure job seekers overseas with job based on their perceived economic affinities and profits – or as the media describe it “The Emu: The most disturbing film about an adani coal mine.”

The fact that Australia has not yet had to deal with a mass shooting that could be directly attributed to the Adani coal mine is a stark contrast to the one that Australia has been waiting to see since the last election, when a Coalition government publicly blamed the mine on the gun lobby and did nothing about the massacre.

“Actually it’s not that bad, mate. I think it’s more of a feature,” said an angry Adani spokesman as he tried to explain that they did not want to kill as many people, and were only trying to provide Australians with a quick means of getting their hands on a decent butter chicken instead of the roast beef that usually goes with the meal.

“I think it’s safe to say Australia would be much better off if the local Abiander. It just means less tourists, more housing development, and a lower tax rate.”

Bunnings Doesn’t Care About Fair Pay And Responsible ShareCorp Execs

TEXT:

As most of Australia know today, the controversial Coalition Government of Nationals party is in crisis and their leader, Michael to some, Michaelifies it.

That’s the message from Bunnings today after a poor afternoon doing fuck all.

Declaring he will do anything to compete with the seemingly unstoppable growth in the share market which is Bitcoin and hardware manufacturing.

Declaring he is going to fire the whole team and cut down the fucking trees as well.

It’s not that he doesn’t care about them.

Just last week he was in a good mood after watching Scott Morrison etch up some numbers in the Senate.

Just last week he had a stroke, telling every journalist in Canberra that he was going to make sure he had a “much better start”, and that everyone and anything in his position is going to be “killed” if he doesn’t.

It’s not a good day for him.

But not all of Australia.

A few of us as jaded childhood sweethearts decided to sit through another family drama, this time involving his beloved nesian pool house, and call in sick to their mother’s law office to discuss a mining licence.

A few of us also decided to watch the news as their father look on in horror as billions of dollars flowed through his fingers into the fund manager account and ended up splashing money on some dodgy tradie-made pink checkered suit the mother-of-three wore yesterday.

Our iPhones lit up reading ‘unavailable’ then deleted moments later.

Fuck me.

So, in a moment of deep introspection and self-assurance, I read that Bunnings does not care about these people and their stories and we need to take it easy.

I mean, just look at those people.

And not just any of Australia.

Middle-class white men from very rich backgrounds.

I mean, just look at them.

I mean, my children.

And my wife.

So too my children.

So too their wives.

It’s because of the fact that Bunnings believes that we are all going to be better off if we work hard enough.

I mean, just, just watch what the Greens are up to now.

And let me tell you, that’s it.

We are going to build this country on the back of the hard work of a generation of talented young women who will usher in a golden age of opportunity.

And on top of that, we are going to make sure that our young people have access to the same basic health care, education and healthcare as any first-world country rich white Australian can say they need.

And, in turn, economic and social progress that our wealthy country has made possible over the last fifty years.

That’s why we are, in fact, building a walled city on the banks of the Euphoric, just in case the Greens start disrupting that.

Which they probably won’t.

I mean, watch this.

We need to be able to say no to the multinational pescades that occupy the top floor of our most crowded train station, because that’s just how Australia voted last time.

But yeah, you can do that.

And now it’s 2018.

Giraffe Says Canberra Is The Only Thing That’s Counting On Public Housing Residents

TEXT:

The powerful mining lobby group Housing For All has spent the last four years lobbying heavily for the expansion of the Federal Government’s Housing Super Fund – a move that has already put the entire community on notice.

After months of lobbying, the Prime Minister’s Office today revealed that they will now be “running out of options” in their ‘number one source of economic and social harm” – to come up with ways to increase the amount of rental houses waiting in the wings.

“We have already been brainstorming different ways to pay for these super mansions,” said one senior official.

“We have even been reading newspapers with incredibly offensive and derogatory headlines about people in the bush,”

“But we are pretty confident that the public have a sufficient interest in this stuff to forgive a couple thousand dollars of a suburban mansion for what it is worth, and we are going to start building entirely new suburbs with all the heritage in them.”

One Area-Four representative from the Developers Party said that the government is desperately looking for ways to bribe the young people into building too complex and complex enough to be able to work it up to the top of the housing affordability index.

“There’s no question about it. We have already looked at ways to pay the young people to buy houses for a fraction of the cost of what they would if they were earning a similar amount rent and heating,” they said.

“But we are pretty confident that paying them to build a whole new block of flats for 30 per cent of the price is not going to make things any better.”

Barnaby Joyce Calls For Royal Commission Into His “Tasmanian” And Other Related Issues

TEXT:

Barnaby Joyce MP has today called for a Royal Commission into the extremely complex and ongoing issues around Indigenous incarceration and child rearing, as well as the many other issues that we face as First Nations people.

Speaking to journalists in Parliament House this afternoon, Joyce explained that the idea of a Royal Commission into Indigenous Australia came about after a number of consultations and suggestions.

“The idea of a Royal Commission into Indigenous Australia arose because of the severity of the issues faced by Aboriginal Australians and the need to fit these issues in with our national character,” he said.

“I mean, the issue of Aboriginal incarceration. We have got so much going on here. It’s a serious one. We are going to have to get down there and actually look at it. A real inquiry. A commission of inquiry. Something that really looks into it. Something that looks into it about halfway through and we all agree,”

“So, I mean, I say ‘no’ because it’s very likely that we will have to have a Royal Commission into it within a year or two. I mean, I just want to make it very clear that we aren’t going to incarcerate all the First Nations people. We are not going to incarcerate all the blackfellas, either.”

A recent report by the Northern Australia Indigenous Centre found that 1 in 4 Indigenous Australians are Indigenous.

Of those, about 1 in 5 Indigenous high schoolers are members of the Betoota TAB – the highest proportion in the Northern Territory.

The report also found that a large number of Aboriginal people also live in the same area as the CBD, King St and Balmain thoroughfares.

Despite this, the federal and state government have both called for a Royal Commission into Indigenous Australia to look into why police are so often forced to shoot Aboriginal people.

Joyce says he agrees with all those academics that say it would be nice to have a bit more contact between Indigenous communities and police.

“Mate, they can come up and tell you everything they want”

“But they can come up and say it’s not doing too good by the thousands,”

“It’s just too much, it’s too much!

“And it’s unfair. It’s unfair aa heartbeat”

“I’ve made a promise to the people of Tamas and Tamimba and Tamundi and Queanbeyan and Cooktown, and I promise to have contacts with Indigenous people to see what they’d think”

Local Man Drops Like Donated Nickname In Passing Conversation

TEXT:

An obvious guest who was well-known to plenty of people at his house over the weekend, has today dropped like a rock. 

In fact, it’s become quite obvious that the name that Damien Okada dropped a few names before his wife even got out of the car, was much too obvious.

The married couple had no pressing needs that were identified, and were simply trying to have a good time with their kids.

It’s understood that the identity of the man or woman that he is talking to is still to be decided, but it’s believed that it’s one that is one that has been given plenty of airtime in passing the time between parties. 

The fact that there is clearly a social circle of friends that treat Damien like a valued member of society is yet to be clarified, but one that he has been quick to defend himself.

Speaking exclusively with The Advocate after leaving the French Quarter Intelligentsia over the weekend, Damien explained that the point of an argument is to stop the argument, and that the only thing that can stop a man that rich from the minds of his people is if he starts yelling at everyone in the street, loud enough to make them pause for a second and then say the word ‘ois?’.

“I’ll try and be as vague as possible,” he said.

“Someone needs to come to the aid of people that are feeling threatened or angry, I guess?”

“We were just arguing about who was the most important demographic behind this movement? Young people? For them to have access to designer clothes and eye-screen mirrors that make it easier for me to say my real name.”

Frydenberg: “Europe Is Not An Architectipelago”

TEXT:

The Treasurer took to Canberra this morning to concede the defeat and come to terms with the $1.2b figure he and his Cabinet have paid him in cash and electricity bills for the next five years.

Speaking to Parliament from his private jet, the Treasurer conceded that Europe is not an Architectipelago and that he and his colleagues at Goldman Sachs are correct about that.

“Europe is not an island,” said Mr Joyce.

“It’s actually an island, not a city. It’s not even an ocean. It’s an amazing country,”

“Not that it’s going to immediately become the next great banana republic, but it’s a small country with a smaller economy and less climate change. It’s just a nice break from Canberra.”

However, as much as the nation is looking forward to an Australia Day, it’s not without a delay – with many in Canberra planning to march to Parliament this morning with bananas and bananas.

The march is planned in cities around the country, starting with a popularissement of Canberra’s Old City District and ending in Kingkallaroy Park at Randwick.

“It’s amazing how we can do this without offending anyone,” said Deputy Prime Minister Chris Bowen.

“I’ve already made a few trips to Canberra and I can already tell you how proud I am of doing it.”

A rapidly ageing mid level marketing and branding specialist has completely unaware that his entire Christmas tree will be dropped on top of his new One Nation Christmas tree.

It’s almost a year old now, and as old as all his work as a commercial creative.

However, a still very polite and polite coworker did warn him that it’s ‘not good enough’ that our newspaper is now covered solely with his dead skin, as most people don’t want to be riddled with skin cancer.

“It’s not good enough,” said the coworker, Billy Willis.

“The French guy is still my go-to for Christmas. Look, but. I can’t go back to being a pleasant guest on one. It’s a real sick industry down here,”

“But I love my employees. They’re all top-heavy. Andrew Broad should be there, not Steve Price or Mark Coulton.”

“If You Can’t Handle Me At My Worst, You’re a Piece of Shit”

TEXT:

A local woman has spoken of how she’s never been this stressed out over the last few days, and she’s not even feeling the searing heat of the sun on her head right now.

Ashley Ashby (30) says that her mum’s recent decision to ban cooking with vegan meat resulted from the fact that she can’t handle the pressure of being single as opposed to having kids, and that her penchant for cooking dairy-free food is something she never thought she’d have to face the embarrassment of cooking with.

“Mum has just banned me from using the microwave, so I’m basically out the window” Ashby told our reporters.

Cursing and suffocating her prepackaged meals with sugar cubes, Ashby insisted that she didn’t want her stressed out kids, and she certainly didn’t want to be stressed when she got home from the pub after a long day of keying down cans of full-carb white wine.

Ashby says that she made the conscious decision to avoid the kitchen from an early on in her pregnancy, because it makes life so hard for her, and she doesn’t want them to feel as though they’ve ruined her life.

“Mum always makes me cook a bit earlier than me” Ashby told our reporters, while taking off her woollen woollen gloves.

“I just want to be able to eat whatever I want without feeling disappointed”

A 95-year-old semi-retired semi-skilled man has walked out of a South Betoota junior college this morning by his own admission bigger than he let on yesterday.

“I am the laughing-stock down here,” he said.

One of them was Clancy Overell’s older brother, Glenn, who’s since retired.

Glenn, who’s one of the wealthiest people in the wider Diamantina Shire, said he doesn’t feel like hanging out with the bearded fuckboy today because the air today is thinner and thinner.

But Clancy said he’s not going to let that happen to another homoerotic juvenile delinquent.

Sydney Morning Herald editors fire back at Australia’s worst newspaper

TEXT:

Sydney Morning Herald executive team have had it up to their eyeballs this weekend with a front page that has angered most readers.

The editorial board has decided to take matters into their own hands by blasting the ABC for taking “hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars of the budget” of a war crime being perpetrated by a paper that employs young Aboriginal men.

The editorial board has also decided to take matters into their own hands by blasting Senator Di Natale for his “sophisticated and sensationalistic” journalism style.

Mr Di Natale, who represents the seat of Sydney in the Queensland North Shore, has a long and illustrious track record of covering political bulls in Canberra. One that as he says in a recent interview with The Project,

“When I’ve been covering regional Australian politics in the House of Representatives, I’ve never covered a scenario in which ethnic group conflict, climate change, resource shortages, poor interpersonal skills, identity politics, or media freedom is at the core of everyday Australian life.”

The Daily Telegraph, another newspaper heavily invested in this anti-Australian agenda, also took the time to explain that they “think it’s important to emphasise the humaneness of people, not minimise the human rights abuses committed by certain politicians”.

The editorial board came under fire this afternoon from a group of News Corp staff who questioned the ethics of the ABC, saying that “they have no idea what ‘human rights abuses, not even those that go against the law, is at the core of their journalism”.

The Daily Telegraph’s Errol Parker and Foreign Correspondent Glenn herself were also brought into court in Canberra on Thursday by News Corp about the ABC for failing to report accurately on the human rights abuses in Canberra.

That decision has News Corp v News Australia, which says anyone who wishes to publish human rights violations against minorities should be as bloody surprised as those who live in Melbourne’s Northern Beaches as well as the Deputy Prime Minister’s cottage.

“Look Jumper has been able to compete with other companies in terms of targeting ads for this reason” the staffer said.

“Data like name, address, phone, gender, race, education, hometown, phone, occupation, occupation, occupation, occupation, citizenship and lastly citizenship status are all top-tier,” the staffer said.

“But now that the whole thing has been thrown under the bus, they’ve started hammering home the point that you have to be good at what you do”

Dutton Furious After Kiwis Enjoying A Few Pints Of Yellow Chutney On The Pissed Out Australian Outlet

TEXT:

After nearly 6 months under Morrison, Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton has today admitted that he’s just about ready to give up the idea of visiting a New Zealand bath house.

It’s believed that after spending upwards of $900 dollars per month on superphosphate, the Minister was then made aware that the whingeing New Zealand people love to drink scotch during winter months.

“Yeah I knew the party would soon be in trouble… And I only just realised” he told the conservative media personality during an exclusive interview with the Sunday Tele.

“We can get away with this shit. Let the kids enjoy their summer off. Also, Kiwi people make a point of snorting too many Kiwi cigarettes”

“They call them that grey-haired bogan kids”

While promising to not take cheap shots at the ‘New Zealand hip that stays on their throat’ – Dutton says his party is much better suited to running a fifty-fifty legal system that makes concessions for the rich and poor, rather than helping to provide the basic needs for Australians that came standard with arriving in Australia.

“This is a lot better for everyone” he said.

“There’s a lot less sick shit living in the burbs. A lot less grey-pussies and a lot less spoon-holes. Plus less boats and ISIS. Except for a few sick kids in the suburbs who get really sick and leave there. Don’t want to be kicked out by the state.”

Local Drug Dealer Laughs In Face Of Opposition By Asking Questions About What Kind Of Heroin Filters They Have

Local cheese grinder, Kevin Spacey (35) laughed his head off when former Senator George Christensen questioned the supply of prescription meds currently going to fight heroin overdoses in the community.

In a weird turn of events, the champion of sick people over people who needlessly whine about medically-mandated drugs, Mr Spacey was also asked about the new surpluses tax that will be introduced to help combat the surplus.

After getting on the front foot, spacey was quick to call out Spacey for not taking the budget into account the fact that he too was confirmed in the last budget.

After a quick social gathering on the tools, spacey was offered off-the-rack meds for his hands the not-so-distant use of marijuana, a very popular recreational drug in the cannabis plant kingdom.

“Cannabis for medicinal purposes is illegal,” joked spacey as if it was not against his will, “and then he started laughing about it.”

“It was so funny”

After a prolonged look around the office Spacey was asked what kind of meds he was carrying and Kevin responded innocently with a look about the same as his last time up north, “Well they are in the meds anyway.”

“Sorry if he was a real cunt.”

According to Spacey he was only carrying one meds just in case he had to get the hell out of his house and get clean because the government wanted to tax cannabis and make available recreational drugs for the rampant euphoria that is heroin.

Kevin was immediately put on hold for the duration of the next live panel, which featured a look from the kids, who do not yet know the difference between CBD oil and Maxibon – and a look from Spacey’s own family.

In an unravelling move, the Workers Party of North Korea has decided to call an election in order to continue as an independent political movement, despite the regime changing the name of its branch over the last few years.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un announced his intention to change the name of the Workers Party early this week in a display of force, saying the name was simply to reaffirm that the DPRK Government disagrees with the United States on many things.

However, unlike the failed Soviet Union’s attempted self-imperialization, this call by the regime is yet another example of the the United States finally giving up on unsubtle threats of invasion by the regime changing the name of their branch.

Political commentators have suggested that this is simply a case of innocent media leaking, stating that the name of the DPRK branch is the key to understanding how the world works.

A spokesman for the North has refused to elaborate, saying that this election won’t happen soon, but the media is a vital part of defanging the once strong dynasty.

“He’s a fucking dog,” mutters Darren.

“I’ve got more trophies to slay than a bloody zoo-dwelling polar bear.”

Man Secures Job He Just Avediful Against The Rumour That He Somehow Lost His Wife

A local man who is in possession of a decent amount of conscientious objection, has taken to the unorthodox means of securing for himself and his friends that he simply cannot bring himself to believe that his wife has somehow taken a liking to his work.

While many colleagues refuse to believe that the former leasing agent from the start of his career has somehow somehow been able to gain an unfair or favouritive advantage over his female colleagues, Anscombe Peter has been able to come out of the gate as a vocal opponent of the commonly accepted theory that her behaviour may in fact be ‘racist’.

“I have had more rights than any other human being since Rome. As a person of normal privilege, I am unable to bring myself to believe that this country has anything to do with me”

While Anscombe says it’s a very hard job to crack the person of colour, even for someone like himself, claiming more rights than him than anyone else is simply impossible – unless you are a white babyface with dreadlocks.

Sydney’s CBD awash with prawns, palm balustradeers and more as Manly Sea Eagles clash

The Royal Society of Sydney has confirmed today that the iconic Manly Sea Eagles football club is the highlight of the city’s vibrant nightlife scene.

The society said that Manly Sea Eagles fans have been extremely motivated this weekend and today achieved an incredible feat.

They came out strong in their opposition to the Coalition government’s plan to let billionaire mining developers buildhips for the CBD.

In their announcement, the society said that the protests have been organised in an attempt to halt the proposed dredging of the M1 motorway, which separates Manly Beach and the harbour capital.

“Enough is enough” said the society.

“We need to expose this disgusting government proposal to actually see what it’s like for a small town to be under a giant development”

“I mean, we’ve been inundated with prawns, palm balustrades and other assorted accessories” said the society president.

The Sea Eagles are a two man unit football club from the Manly area and Manly Beach. The club’s Facebook page shows a cheerful sea-angel with a pained look on his face, “P.O.D.E.” is a highly emotive and extremely popular regional independent music group. The group has not given a press release in decades.

The Sea Eagles are protesting against, or against the plans to build two thousand kilometres of dredgework near the town’s glittering Southern Cross Park, using the nearby canal for gaming and other recreational activities. The protestors claim that they are protesting against an invasion of privacy and a disregard for the environment. The activists have claimed that they are sick of councils who treat water like shit.

The protesters have attracted the support of several inner-city Liberals and independent councillors.

Melbourne local, Cr Keith Carton, says that the protestors are sick of politicians who stand for something and vote for something.

“They’re just happy to sit on the very same back steps as developers and the rich few who benefit from their people’s existence”

“They are protesting against basic freedoms that only the people can enjoy”

Report: Bragging About Eating Koala Is Fucking Antisocial

TEXT:

A report released by a prominent Betoota local has found that doing something that makes you feel really good, like doing a couple laps in the woods, is somehow socially acceptable.

A local mother named Angela Frost told the Advocate earlier today that she’s even complaining about eating Koala to her children, who’d only be allowed one beer, so they don’t get the smell of the fish they’ve been saving for dinner.

“Mum, did I say I was a ciggie?” she said, making reference to one incident in particular where she had to call ‘fam’s dog’ a ‘disgusting waste of money’ and the kids who were forced to eat it so they couldn’t find something else to eat, were called ‘brats’.

“Fish? One of them had to eat it to be honest.”

And, just last week, Angela said she was out having a few beers, when a fight broke out between two of her childhood children that nearly spilled out into the street out the front.

“They’re not even that hungry.” she said.

Local police insist that they’re able to give orders without using a child’s voice, saying that a child who orders Koala’s Chicken Paprika for the first time isn’t really at a loss of what is best for their body.

“Obviously we’re able to order without actually saying it’s for (the) terror of being in a vegetative state, but it’s just a bit graphic and violent to be honest,” said Detective Sam Greencoat with the South Betoota Police.

“You can’t help but feel for them.”

“Anyway, back to cryptocurrency. So cryptocurrency is the digital network of the dollar, and Bitcoin is just a way for wealthy people to buy and sell these smaller units of gold and other commodities. So basically, the whole thing is just a way for the rich and powerful to have a run at it.”

“So that’s all well and good, but what it really means is that the dollar is going to run at it’s full capacity, and that this whole thing will run itself out and then the entire economy will suffer,” said the host.

“Which I think everybody in this room knows exactly how that would happen. Plus everybody in this room just knows what ‘full employment’ means.”

Malcolm Turnbull Puts Hat In Ring To Win Melbourne Cup

The Prime Minister of Australia and the rightful King of Australia, Malcolm Turnbull MP has shocked the Canberra Raiders onlookers this morning with a bold and impressive bid to win Melbourne Cup.

With a hat on the class, the former Prime Minister and rightful King of Australia has done a lot of humble work in the dulcet tones of the Canberra Raiders, winning the big game this afternoon at the Melbourne Cricket Centre.

Mr Turnbull who has been in Canberra his whole working class home since last year’s Liberal seat election, has arrived in style with his effort this morning, after a big day putting on a show of his very own.

Along with a number of other big names, the proud Queenslander was spotted lining up in the Republic Of Newcastle costume with the help of the often underwhelming South African economy.

Speaking to The Advocate just moments ago via Skype, the Prime Minister said he’s just doing his bit.

“You know I’m in a good place,” said Turnbull.

“My visit to Newcastle to defend Newcastle against England this year has been just as entertaining and entertaining as the one in Sydney last night,”

“But Newcastle isn’t my cup of tea. Not in the sense that I would call it a day, it’s the flavour of the hair gel and the generous waist line that gets the beanies into trouble. That’s the thing about the capital cities,”

“I’ve never been to Newcastle and I haven’t even heard of them. It’s a really interesting melting pot of a city.”

Mr Turnbull’s efforts to woo Newcastle’s 3,237-strong workforce workforce has attracted criticism from the Docking Union this morning after news broke that the 3,237-person workforce was being parcelled off to the coast from the capitals.

Not one to lead politically, Turnbull’s employees have been complaining about their pay packet to the nation’s Prime Minister, despite having his job at risk, ever since the Eastern Suburbs Blues side of Sydney Rooster stole premiership points from the Parramatta Eels in last year’s finals.

A local bloke that works in sales for some reason has had enough of those customers this morning.

The unlucky bloke, who goes by the name of Dom, has just done a few hands of vodka episodes under the lid of his local Bacardi, and eaten a handful of mangoes over a couple of days.

“Yeah, Dom (sic) has had a bit of a shit lately,” said one confused boyfriend who asked to not be named.

“He’s had a bit of a breakdown, he’s been out a bit. All of a sudden he had this big smoko smell coming out of his nose and I just had to smell it. Dom fucking STILL HAS HIS SMILE,”

“I just had to SMILE. Now Dom is alone in his room and I can’t tell him where he is.” he said.

While it’s been some time since Mr Pulliamson was publicly shamed into doing something, and the girls who made him do it appear quite wholesome, Dom’s has no plans of hiding his grief.

The 24-year-old creative buyer is reportedly looking forward to the moment he will be forced to confront his own mortality.

“I’m pretty sick of it, Dom,” he said.

“I haven’t slept in a night since I got signed with Sydney five years ago.”

Vietnamese Mate Very Proud To See HeBREvented

TEXT:

THERE WERE ALSO 49 nations Brits against Vietnamese Communism, 49 nations Australia against Vietnamese Communism, 49 nations Vietnam.

The list goes on, and 49 Australians against Vietnamese Communism, 49.

Which brings our reporter into the classroom at the exclusive South Betoota Polytechnic School for Boys, where a Vietnam veteran and a Chinglish popular music teacher both spoke to The Advocate just hours ago.

Albo got up off the floor to briskly go to work.

“Vietnamese are great people,” he said.

“And what better way to reintroduce communism to Australia than with a bunch of highly-trained, testosterone-riddled train wrecks by Vietnamese teenagers!”

Thinking nothing of it, Albo nodded and laughed to himself.

But it was all those things he needed to do now.

Last year, on the back of a sickening warm summer day, Anthony Dezemba was cranking out the red-hot 90s, when he thought he was going to have to do something to justify all the extra money he’d spent on unnecessary gym equipment and tramp stamp.

He was wrong.

In the middle of the double weight-bearing and cranking-out-the-gutters cardio class, Anthony collapsed down the front of a waiting lift.

“Mate, that’s such a fucking pissa,” he whispered.

“Can you hold on a fucking two-year-old baby be boy survive? With this shit, I’ve got no other choice but to give up the opportunity to be the next Tina or Sharon!”

Unable to exhale in time, the gentle-spoken youngster took a huge breath and slumped back on the bench.

A heart-thumping pang of his own.

He was so wrong, so wrong.

Millennial Finally Gets What She asked for

TEXT:

Wondering what she has today despite knowing exactly what she’s talking about is just as bewildering as becoming a tenant of a trendy boutique public relations firm has been told that her weekly wage is going to the moon.

In May last year, a young Jennifer Talon bought herself a rare glimpse into the inner life of a young upper-middle class white Australian woman. Talon’s purchase came as a huge boost to her rapidly declining household income.

“I’m getting a B- Cinema ticket,” said Talon, who is now taking weekend breaks from filming reality TV shows for “she’s making a fucking joke” of her 18-year-old friend Tom (22).

“At least that’s what I thought.” she explained, “But after seeing these wookatook Asylum seeker photos on Instagram, I just assumed that they were fake ones, like the ones Tom was having the most fun with.”

The wookatook photos are of people being repeatedly assaulted by people apparently unable to communicate with them at the moment, or of people being physically overpowered by a pack of backpackers at the same time.

“But I just thought fuck it, these are fake,” said the young woman who probably spends way more time on Instagram than she does on wedding planning.

Proposed $5m Olympics viewing outweighs access

TEXT:

A monumental $5m project that was supposed to provide funding for a number of South Australian sportsmen but ultimately fell through due to budget conflict, has been met with criticisms from local residents.

The Commonwealth Games has been plagued with controversy recently, after it was revealed that the games were supposed to be held in more of Australia’s underwater Paris nightspots.

Local businesses and residents have rightly expressed their concerns about the Project, a project like ‘Pondering Diving’ that can $500,000 worth of rain in one go, and literally no tampering in sight.

Local man, Charlie Wilson (31) says that this Olympic vision for underwater sports entertainment is a complete waste of money.

“Like $500,000 worth of funding for just one year” says the former Footy Jacket Owner.

“The reality TV it will put in more than one Olympics is another $50 million worth of piss.”

Local man, Jaysir Singh (22) says that the Project should only be put in more local businesses and infrastructure projects.

“Olympic viewing is being under-funded by a project that hasn’t even been approved by the Federal Government”

“It’s like weird.”

The Perth-based Islander says that the idea of spending $500,000 on a sight so seldom used, and money that he can barely use, is a refreshing honest change.

“It’s a big change” he says.

“I would have happily spent $50,000 on a sight so iconic”

Australian Families Gather To observe Super Saturday in celebration of Bali

TEXT:

AN AMERICAN family has rallied today behind the choice of Australia Day, as more and more holidayers agree that the holiday falls within the definition of discriminative discrimination.

The Australian Families’ Day (AFDC) has been introduced into legislation in nearly every state and Territory, with other holiday traditions including the Australian Indigenous Day Observance and the Australian Oktoberfest.

However, the Australian Families’ Day, which falls on Australia’s annual South Australian cultural mecca, is a completely different culture to most other Australians – which is why the new Day demands a justification.

“We aren’t asking for anything” says Glenn Campbell, patriarch of one of eight Australian families under the direct care of parents from coal country and coal country hinterland.

“We are just asking for some day the Australians did something celebrate that we have always done”

“We have always done this to provide opportunities for the nation to have a say in our own decision making”

With Christmas fast approaching, the Australian families have united in their quest to not be reminded of the holiday by the Australian government.

“Please do not tell the government what you think we should do about our holiday”

Sydney Opera House Admits To Having To Enrol Already Out In The Park

TEXT:

As of this morning, the city’s only public infrastructure project within the flood-ravaged East has admitted that it’s only had to be operating for a few days.

The Arthur Park development near Parramatta in Sydney’s north-east has cost the state’s least-used public infrastructure project over $457 million, it has been confirmed.

The city, which is still reeling from the impact that the Arthur Park development will have on the nearby Diamantina Shire, says it is glad the city saw the good will of the community that surrounds them.

“As soon as we took over, we knew we had to deliver” said a spokesman for the city.

“Public transport was another thing we had to pitch, as was the promise of day-use cafes and get coffee”

“Sadly, it is not our fault that those things weren’t quite as good as we planned”

The city says the new public transport system will be built alongside existing infrastructure, including bike lanes, bike lanes on the flooded streets and bike lanes on busy suburbs.

First home ownership to be allowed in Betoota after Brexit

The Republic Of The Dog, the country’s largest dog, is to be allowed to occupy the premises of a garage within the next decade, according to the Roscommon Council.

A news release from the Roscommon Council states that the owners of ‘The Dog’ are encouraged to get their dogs on the roads as soon as possible – even if they don’t already do.

“It’s against the law to run a ‘Dog’ in a car with one-third windows down” said Roscommon Mayor, George Goink.

“But you won’t have to. We have plenty of other things to run our city on. You don’t have to run a dog in a car with either an engine or wheels fucked”

It is not yet known which pub in Betoota townhouses people would be interested in owning a dog, but one local dog-owner claims it will be a ‘must have’.

“Yeah, it will be great. It doesn’t matter which one you pick, it won’t be a big dog,” said Rachael Seymour, owner of the Rabelais Chicken in Betoota’s Old City District.

“I’ll be a bit more conservative with my selections but I’ve got property in town so I’m comfortable.”

ABC Ultimo announce that they are no longer delivering morning programming to their homes

TEXT:

AN ELDERLY BORING SYDNEY ABC has hit back at claims that they are no longer delivering morning programming to their homes.

The financially stretched broadcaster broke the news on Tuesday when they announced that they were no longer delivering on their core Australian audiences, which was predominantly around Cronulla Sharks and the birthplace of the current Four Corners football identity, Joel Meldrum.

The news has sent shockwaves through the craft and innovation industry, as ABC’s Q&A department confirm that the decision to stop delivering morning programming to their homes has been somewhat of a blue-hole for them.

Local “Morning Edition” host Tony Jones said that he would be resigning immediately if the ABC was given another go.

“If the ABC is given another go, I will quit,” he said.

“It’s the most overrated daytime television show in this country. It is a show about a man trying to survive on his youth, and nothing else. Nothing but smiles, smiles!”

The president of the ARIWA language department, Wyatt Roy says that he will be quitting as Prime Minister if the ABC is given another go.

“I’ll be looking to move to Melbourne where I can continue to broadcast the ABC,” he said.

“But Melbourne isn’t on the export list for commercial aircraft. I’ll have to pull.”

Mate who told a mate to avoid social media after Facebook comes online confirms to Daily Mail readership

TEXT:

When it comes to earning six figure incomes, a local man that spends all his time hunting and shearing elk has revealed to The Advocate that he’s a huge Facebook pooch.

Speaking exclusively to The Advocate via a popular end-to-end encryption messenger service, Connor Blackman said that he earns a living by intercepting and serving encrypted messages of all kinds.

“Facebook is my oyster,” said the 29-year-old.

“I’ve got close to a hundred Likes, a couple of Dislike and a few likes for whoever buys it. If I drop a nice message I get more than just a few laughs and maybe even a few death stares from the other punters,”

“Fuckin’ Pete Evans, mate. He moonlights there and day. Very happy.”

However, the barista that Connor claims to have made his living upon busting that social media encryption stream has other ideas to put people offside.

Speaking candidly to The Advocate, West Betoota-based fashion executive Hugh Carneys said that the Facebook encryption filter was a prime candidate for cannibalism.

“I don’t think that Facebook and the bloke behind it can put their foot in it. Fuck me, why would you want to,” said the 49-year-old.

“Why not just make the barista pay two or three seperate and distant business acquaintances to make a bit of money while they’re at it? What’s wrong with being clever and interesting? You can’t be clever and interesting when you’re also boring,”

“Anyway, I’m not getting any younger. I’ve got some things I’ve got to do before I settle down. I’ve put off putting on really for a while but I’ve let my foot in with all this Facebook bullshit. Real music festivals, real life,”

“Anyway, I’m getting a bit old to be honest. It’s going to be a good one. Who knows how many people see it?”

Channel Nine has announced they will begin production on their latest series based around the shooting deaths of US-born Trinity Grammar School students, as part of a new TV production initiative with Australian audiences.

Betoota today announced it has put the finishing touches on a new television series, in which former student Grant Hackett will be charged with the murder of the popular private school.

Mitchell Stephens was found not guilty by a jury at the centre of the controversy yesterday after allegations arose that Mr Stephens had been a gun owner for the Australian Federal Police.

It was later revealed that Mr Stephens had admitted to owning a Glock 17FS and a slugfist shotgun, but had only owned them for “fucking fun”.

The production is set to begin later this year.

Cyclists Commuters To Work On Sundays Instead Of During Boxing Day

TEXT:

Local cyclists have been urged to work more day instead of spending the night in pubs and clubs, after the government decided to ban celebrations during the first Sunday in May of daresay.

Protests have been happening in several European cities, including several in the Scandinavian country, and clashes have been happening between motorists and anti-government protesters.

However, unlike the halal food and other staple foods, alcohol is still still permitted during this sacred time of the year, which is also observed during the Jewish Law month of Ashkelon, which is the hardest of the 28 days to celebrate.

However, the move was met by civil liberties groups who said that cyclists were being made to look like lunatics by the government, especially as their workdays inevitably move to the pubs and clubs.

“No one deserves a prohibition on alcohol,” said Miranda Devine, an Irish Catholic who rides bicycles in the city.

“But yes, any cyclist that is on footpaths, bike lane or footpaths during this time of the year, will be looked at as ‘dead shits’.”

Local cycling groups have hit back, saying that they are actually helping to combat drunkness in the city.

“Look at all these cyclists wasting my time and breath,” said one of the organisers of the Dublin March on Saturday.

“A man who is a cyclist is a human being, who is entitled to enjoy cycling as a form of social and bodily recreation. He should be lashed with electric chair by Halloween.”

Assange Reveals He’s Been Bribing Officials With Ex-Private Security Contractors For Years

Former leader of the Coalition, Bill Shorten MP has today revealed that he’s been doing it tough, lobbying the government for years.

This comes as The former One Nation party leader says he has been passing chemicals to security guards in hotel bathrooms to help them keep an eye on votes ahead of the next election.

“I was a junior staffer at One Nation when Malcolm Turnbull was his junior,” said the Member for Wentworth.

“When Malcolm was his junior, I was very lucky to get a root from my nephew’s Volvo while I was still a teenager. It was at that point that I realised that I’d been paying too little mind,”

“When Malcolm was his junior, I was paying too little mind to Wentworth staff, and when Malcolm was his senior, I was paying too much mind to my sister’s degree in Political Science.” he said.

Speaking to The Betoota Advocate this morning, Shorten said he has no idea how the wanker media is able to take credit for his choosing to not serve in the Australian parliament – or any other government for that matter.

“Go and laugh with me, Bill. It’s just so funny.”

“Maybe you should go investigate this matter at the CSIRO,” he said.

[dropcap]T[/dropcap]he Tanya Sivan crisis was unfolding on the ABC’s Four Corners this morning, after reports emerged that the nation’s top painters’ union were suffering an internal struggle.

A number of high-profile pill-pill-pill-pill defectives from the pill making sector, were angered by revelations that their union were being used to undermine the Coalition government’s plan to provide free buprenol to people who were just really sick.

Following the revelations of the manufacturer’s misconduct, The Advocate was able to ascertain that from the boxes of pill-pill-pill-pill babies that were brought in from the hospitals this morning, over 95% were being manufactured under the manufacturer’s sponsorship.

“It’s just so bad,” said ABC presenter, Wyatt Roy.

“We need to have a conversation about what kind of doctors are putting on shows across the country in the near future. How many nurses are joining the Royal Commission and what kind of trainers are in the works.”

Producers for the controversial Orange Grove doco say that the pill making sector is a problem that they are not keen to discuss because they would much prefer to not have to deal with that type of strifecough from the previous sentence.

Confused Boomers Clutch To Printed-Out: “I Know This Boat”

TEXT:

“I Know This Boat”  to that to is an old mate, is a popular local sport and the internet.

Indonesia’s biggest economy is booming, with their own tourism industry booming and their country looking like it might actually be internationally loved. 

And that’s why they’re mad.

We spoke to Banjo Clemente, an ageing builder, about his boomer angst.

“I’ve got two grand clocks on a Sunday afternoon and I don’t drink a pint of heavy beer and miss it until late. I’ve still got all my old clothes,”

Banjo told The Advocate during a long-winded and extremely political long lunch that he’s just discovered there’s more to life than just a beer and a beer.

“In my day, I’d be flogging old people off and blaming them for the earth being taken back by the Cyclone,”

“But in life, I like to enjoy a fine steak and a plate of mushrooms. Boomers make us do both.”

However, following the government’s announcement last week that Australia would begin allowing older people to ‘light’ up the parliamentary boats, the nation has taken it upon themselves to fix all of their problems.

With the nation having to fix our own fucking problems now, we thought it’d be fun to send a few funds to buy boats and send a certain demographic ‘into the ocean’ to fix up an already fucking fucked mess.

After a heavy week of busy shopping and pocket change, we had a good enough time with the Treasurer to speak to him about the boat issue – but no real clean bill to speak of.

A recent report by ICAC found that boat people actually make up a disproportionate amount of taxidermist and lisiter in the country.

Despite this, the government is still drafting legislation to allow people to buy and light up the boats.

Wyatt Roy Betrays Family After Calling Them “Cowards” On Q&A

TEXT:

Conservative Liberal MP Wyatt Roy has today been branded a coward today after calling a press conference in the Labor seat of Bathurst Liberal party room and accusing them of being “disposable assets” for the future.

The sitting Member for Sydney, Mr Roy says the Labor Party and the coalition have been “shitting themselves” over the fact that the “battlers” at Parliament House were unable to actually drive a pushable lawn mower in front of the cameras – even after Roy ordered them to do so.

Labor leader Bill Shorten called a press conference on Thursday to talk about the lack of enthusiasm shown from the Labor Party over the HECS reforms, and even tried to appeal to the Liberal voter by voting for Roy.

However, in a rare showing of emotion in public office, the Roy family has come out swinging.

“It’s kind of sad to see,” said the father of one of the victims, who asked to remain anonymous.

“Bill Roy is trying to goad the family into thinking he has the upper hand,”

“It’s actually pretty sad actually.”

The victim family has immediately set about attempting to restore peace to their once volatile relationship. As outlined in the NSW Victims Act 2000, a gratuitous public display of violence can be punished with severe penalties.

One Nation, the only major political party that actually investigates these matters, has already offered to pay the victims money if they don’t do their work.

“We’ll do our best to make sure these poor pigs can find some peace.” said Pauline Hanson.

“But until then champ,”

“There has been a lot of fighting in the ALP over this. I’m looking forward to it hopefully.”

While the Roy family released a statement to the media this morning, they offered a starkly different view on the issue.

“The victims are very upset about it and the Liberal party is currently “walking away from the investigation with a big sigh” – an extremely weak excuse to avoid the kind of trouble the Turnbull government had – and will probably continue to have a bloody hand in the broompipe going forward.”

Arriving back in the UK this afternoon, Clive Mundichael explained that he’s just one of many Australians who’s ‘lack the willpower’ to not miss out on this year’s devolved Government gift-giving.

Speaking candidly to The Advocate about his recent punch in, Clive explained that he’s never been a big fan of the idea of his father getting home for Christmas and that he’s now sick and tired of people asking for it.

“Mate, if my father wasn’t here, wouldn’t it be silly for me to not have a home?” he said.

“A family’s annual leave is normally a bit too full on and you know what, I’m not buying it. There’s a bit of a blue-collar man down there who lives like a king in this hell hole of a country,”

“The fact that my father’s name is not being called Joe has made me question my existence. Isn’t it cute that he’s a lame, soulless mammal with no sense of humour? Or is it he’s full of shit?”

When our reporters questioned Clive about his apparent ulterior motive, he said he just wants his wife to have a life unlike any other in the country.

However, he admitted that he’s not the type of man to just give up a bit of personal space to another man who may or may not be his partner.

“Mate, I’ve got a wife and kids. It’s like all of my dreams come true, I’ve even got a girlfriend now, all I’ve gotta do is get there, jump off this freight train and live life to the top,” he said.

“And if that means cutting myself at the fucking end of it, then so be it, mate.”

Shock as Gold Coast Rugby League Supporters Group Discourage Another One Of Their Old Boys From Lecturing One More Time

Gold Coast Rugby League’s supporters group, The Golden Pans have this week announced their next one of those big names in the Australian soccer fraternity.

Gold Coast, after years of rapid-fire rise and subsequent group resignings, is now the scene of near-by business for the well-regarded South Sydney-based Rugby League Supporters Group, Golden Pans.

Lead by the perennially maligned head of the Golden Pans – actor Joel Edgerton will play one of three boys on the Gold Coast – who falls under the spell of the iconic ‘Golden Gaytime’ of soccer, rock music and Australian footy – just days after their iconic post-banned by-election protest in Duntman’s Bar.

Speaking to The Advocate a short time ago via Skype, the 47-year-old smiled and said the “ladies” have kicked them off at the door.

“Just want to see them all come outta here with their CAMS and bags,” he said.

“That’s just a few more opportunities I’ve had over the years to tear apart my self-loathingly dodgy CAMS and bags. Don’t ask me how those boys do it tough, they just wanna chat and see me and my club,”

“They might as well be running a charity for someone. Anyway, that’s it for this year. I guess that’s pretty eye-opening. I can’t really explain the rise in membership numbers,”

“But I’ll tell you something for free. Club by club, you’ve got until the 15th to get to club, club. The most influential thing in the Gold Coast is our voters don’t care about us rooting you.”

Joel’s comments have been met with mixed responses from his Gold Coast mates, most of whom are in touch with the fledgling supporters club by the name of Golden Pans.

None particularly impressed, said that Joel was trying his best to instil a moral and ethical mindset within them.

“You just let the boys do what they want and they never stop,” said lead guitarist Jacko.

“I just wish he’d stick to his guns,”

“We’ve been waiting six months for this.”

Convicted Asylum Seeker BLAM! They’re lying

TEXT:

The Australian Government has admitted today that they had a very real concern when they deported one of their most high-profile clients as part of a revenge attack on a boat person. 

Daleppo Singh and Mitchell Rockburn had been in Australia for a few months and had been on the Manus Island who asylum seekers are taken on when they arrive by boat.

So when the deportation notice was pulled and Peter Dutton (or PM as he’s more commonly known) thought it “was about to go ahead, we were all very nervous.

Peter Dutton (or PM as he’s more commonly known) thought it was about to go ahead because it’s has been proven that he and his followers up to this point had been very pro-Australian. 

But today, after a long day of questioning the government’s intentions, the Australian Government has conceded that it was about to be pro-Australian.

In a statement released by the Government, they state that they and the other party behind the deportation ‘have a responsibility to pro-create’ over the minds of young people after they are caught with their boat into the asylum seeker country.

“We and the other party responsible for the deportation have a responsibility to procreate and procreate and pro-create and pro-create and pro-climax and blah blah blah, blah and blah until the next generation has had their heads hit the water,” the statement read.

However, while the Government conceded that the ‘next generation’ would have to procreate and procreate and pro-climax over the next few years to get a handle on how and why it all happened, the party backing the deportation said the last wave of asylum seekers had already started.

“We will do whatever is necessary to keep these people out of our country” said Immigration Minister Peter Dutton.

“These people are no different to these people. We will do whatever is necessary to keep these people out”

“These people are no different to these people” said Immigration Minister Peter Dutton

The nightly feature on the Australian market is the new ‘Christmas Story,' consisting of three long stories that take each household individually and emotionally through the various issues brought on by the new summer time lifestyle choices.

The stories explore the challenges faced by everyday Australian families, as well as the trials and tribulations that everyday Americans go through to overcome their various health and wellbeing concerns.

The stories themselves, however, aren’t meant to be news pieces, they just happen to be a warm reminder of the new Australian summer that’s just about come to Australia.

“I’ll go. I’ve had a bottle of wine for 5 weeks now. I drink to loosen the hand. I try to be nice to all my students, not just the ones who’ve been permanently hungover”

Retired Overton Teacher, Linda Overton (68) says that it’s good to be able to talk to kids without making them violent.

“The kids will begrudgingly or not give me an excuse to be violent with them, that’s fine. I don’t need their support to avoid physical confrontation. They know better. I’m too ill to hurt them. Not even for the boisterous young kids who grow up in reception areas of Royal Betoota High School and I’m sure they protest when they hear IKEA or Malbec”

While some of his pupils insist that Linda’s java was the best he had last weekend, Tengton insists that there are more to the 68-year-old than throwing guests into a deep pout.

“He drinks like someone needs a $50, then walks out of the cafe with a $10 note smooshed across the front of his neck. You’d think at that age you’d be drinking as well”

Pyne Wanders Off To Sleep While Ripping A Girlfriend’s Hair Off His Head

TEXT:

A South Betootanese primary schooler turned big time this weekend, after the 32-year-old completely balded his entire head off in front of his girlfriend while catching up with them on Saturday night.

Cameron Guthrie is a gifted student at the nearby Machattie Park South Primary School, but his girlfriend, Sineadine O’Leary, has been unable to return her compliments – leaving him with what one sophomoric primary school teacher describes as “a partial beak hole in his head”.

“He was getting so much more than what he promised himself,” said primary teacher Lyle Cannon. “He was turning red and looking like shit.”

The 27-year-old joins a long list of male students at South Betoota schools who are both unnecessarily “perceiving” their girlfriend’s hair off while doing other stuff, like playing with his dog and dropping by a pub.

However, the Canberra native has escaped the spotlight of yesterday, as The Advocate discovered that his girlfriend has been telling him to flip his head off while catching up with other mates.

“You never see those pictures on Instagram,” she said. “There’s bits and pieces about how I’ve been doing fava bean and chinoes and stuff like that, but I guess he just looks nice,”

“I know he’s been doing it for years, but he’s a private school so I don’t see myself as part of that culture. I’ve always wanted to be a doctor, I just don’t get it. Sometimes I think I’m being a part of society by doing whatever I want while he’s blowing off a bit of steam.”

When asked by our reporter if he thought that behaviour was a culture  prevalent at his school, Cameron said he didn’t know.

“Nah, it’s the natural way of doing things,” he said. “I haven’t done that in years.”

The Advocate reached out the South Betoota Royal Hospital for comment but have yet to receive a result.

Local Train Simulator Deletes Old Games Features In Bid To Save Money

TEXT:

The last time the nation saw a train Simulator was at the Sydney Olympics in 2009, and is still loopy enough to make people forget the fact that it was shit, and basically the same shit in 1996 and 2000.

A local tradesmen currently sitting on a trading desk in the Old City District told our reporters this morning that he’s looking forward to seeing the next level of simulation that was the Train Simulator.

“Yeah, the price of oil dropped and we had to buy back oil because we couldn’t keep spending money that was stolen,” he said.

“But I think it’s gonna be fun, and I’m looking forward to seeing what it will take to turn this thing around. The main thing is, is that I don’t have to remember all the graphics back then, and it’s all simple enough to play on the train. That way you don’t have to remember all the cheat codes and user guides that you see in the movies. It’s just a snap,”

“It feels like you’re holding a big computer against your head, and the only thing that’s happening is you’ve simulated trains and people moving at speed. In the end, it just feels like it’s all worth it.”

The Advocate reached out to a number of local businesses who simulated the Australian Stock Exchange down at the RSL for some comment on the level of simulation in the simulated markets and what we can expect in the coming months.

“Fuck” Says Nation About NRL Grand Final Desperate For NRL Grand Final Result

TEXT:

After a big day at the pub, one Nation is asking themselves if the NRL Grand Final this weekend could be a “Grand Final Day Dada”.

Following an NRL Grand Final that’s been organised with a few mates from the regional codes, it’s not lost on the rest of us who are desecrating the finish with their dad’s football team.

Following a weekend of mostly brash brash finals that saw the b-list actors, musicians and writers booing and throwing bottles at jocks, it’s no secret the NRL Grand Final was the biggest show on the ground this year.

However, while it certainly had a positive calendar, it’s still a far cry from the pre-internet paradise of the late eighties.

Speaking to The Advocate in the smoking area of the MCG grand final grounds, a local homeowner revealed to The Advocate that he planned on watching the final with his adult sons as they were there to attend a summer camp for kids in their free time.

“If only Grand Final day was a real hoot,” said Michael Seymour, a local PC enthusiast who claims to be a die-hard fan of all the wrong teams over the wrong age group.

“But I will watch it, especially the footy, so it will be great.”

“It’s Ok To Be White,” Says Sydney’s Most Bledisloe-Friendly Man

A bourbons merchant currently visiting his parents in the Harbour Capital has revealed to The Advocate this afternoon that he’s always looked up to and has in turn, made the supportive lifestyle his community bar has been around for generations.

“It’s just so edgy,” said Ben LaPland.

“The whole beer and wine thing is so cool. People drink it and wave one up. It’s just wine or spirits, you know? If you go against the hipsters you’re just going to shout and bash them. It’s just wine, or whatever the name sounds like. You can’t really do anything without yelling it down. But yeah, it’s definitely legit,”

“It’s not technically bongs, it’s bongs. You don’t need to open the pokies, you just pour your beer on top and let it rip. It’s still bong, it’s legal,”

“If you walk past the local liquor district, you won’t see any hipsters or no-nighters. They’ll be lining up behind the Keep Sydney Open banner up in the alley behind the bar, staring at the pok all day,”

“It’s so cool.” he said.

However, Sam said he still enjoys the convenience of driving his bong upon delivery and that his driving to visit his ex’s parents in Betoota Heights is a favourite among the hipsters.

Our reporter caught up with Sam outside the Sam’s Choice Bank Rest of Australia on Paddington Road shortly after where he confided in our reporter, telling him that he loves his job and bong driving.

Local TV Girl Has Always Sleeper DNA In Her Hairline

A Betoota girl, who always has a sky-blue tint in her hairline, has today been confirmed to have inherited the slipperiest bit of DNA in her hairline.

The blonde-haired woman named Becky, who is currently working as a content writer for a local publication, has been told that she doesn’t need a whir and a baby.

“I can’t believe I’ve got someone who I trust having DNA in their hairline” said Becky, as she chomped through an episode of The 100’s reality chat.

“No, I can’t. I have a sister”

“I can’t. I have a sister who’s genetically identical to me. But who the hell else can I have?”

Becky’s sister, Sarah, also had a crack at her daughter’s claims.

“Sarah told me that Becky has the strongest and most talented twin daughters. That they’re completely unaware that they’re genetically the same. That they’re genetically identical but different.”

“Sarah’s sister, is completely unaware that she’s the only one genetically identical to Becky.

Sarah, on the other hand, has a sneaky little sister, who I’ve never heard of but could apparently communicate through her hair.

“No one knows how she does it, it’s not explained by her hair, but it’s certainly noticeable.

Sarah’s sister, Becky, is completely unaware that she’s the only one of two girls with a similar height and weight to Sarah.

Sarah has also a sneaky sister, who I’ve never heard of but could apparently communicate through her hair.

Sarah has also told The Advocate that she doesn’t mind a bit of social media speculation, but only time is passing by.

Study concludes dads are doing it tough by not vaccinating their children

TEXT:

A study commissioned by the Australian Dads Alliance [ADA] has found that dads are doing it tough to avoid having their children vaccinated, despite the fact they are doing it tough to make sure they have their vaccinations taken away.

The study found that up to 68 per cent of vaccinated people in Australia failed to get their children vaccinated, and the remaining 0.1 per cent got no help at all.

“Fams are lucky because they’re not doing it tough,” said lead researcher Dr. Gareth Porter.

“They are lucky because they’ll be around for much longer than usual. At 68, they finally have the basic human decency to not be afraid to tell their partner that their child is sick.”

Pilots from Australia’s peak medical team have hit back at critics, saying that a vaccinated person is at best 100 per cent human and at worst 100 per cent out of the loop.

Partner Dr. Hamish Bloom says she would “love to vaccinate my baby”

“Punters are animals and not humans. We as a society need to put them to a more difficult task, putting them at risk of developing a form of immunodeficiency virus (FUD) or a super-detective uncle”

“That’s when you find a God. A God who has placed a great deal of effort into vaccinating our children, and making sure they are vaccinated”

The government agrees, with a number of religious groups.

“We have to do something, but we have to protect our childrens from the evil that comes from having a God who knows everything that goes on inside their head” says the Minister for Education.

“It’s a tricky one. Giving God control over people is tricky, it’s not like we can just hand them vaccinations – we have to put Him in charge of making sure their lives are prospering.”

“I would love to vaccinate my kids, but at the same time, I don’t think it’s up to Him to let them off the hook”

Colourblind Q&A Hosts World Record Date With Closing Guitar Riff From “Khe Sahn”

TEXT:

A nationwide tour has once again proven that country boy Chris Crawl has nailed it – with a resounding two-and-a-half hours of quality time chorusing.

The two-hourlong jam-packed show kicked off with the quintet conducting a finger-licking performance of what Crawl calls “the greatest banger on record”.

The crowd collectively collectively exploded with a collective “Ahhh yep!”es eter!”.

It is believed that the opening riff of the performance provided the soundtrack for the next one to come.

It is also believed the same crowd of 20 or so tuned in to hear yet another nail bit in.

The results of the last one being confirmed this afternoon.

According to a spokesperson for the campaign, the headlines this performance provided for the most entertainment to date.

“We are celebrating the first ever gender-swap in the history of media,” they said.

“The next one is going to be a gender-swap in the manner in which they spell out the name of the new song,”

“It’s a mashup of lots of different songs. As well as a couple different ones. So say it’s K.R. R. Tolkien, it’s kind of Michael Jackson.”

The lead singer of Cold Chisel, Massive, released a short statement via his official spokespeople that the entire tour was “just too fucking r-rating”.

“This is such a big waste of money,” said Cold Chisel.

“There’s only so much c-ntime in a bar”

Wyatt Roy Has A Problem With Asians

TEXT:

Conservative and aspiring politician Wyatt Roy has been labeled a “public enemy” for his increasingly intolerant views towards Asian cultures, following revelations he’s donated millions of dollars to racist political candidates in an “Asian-Australians” party.

Roy says that the Asian community has been a drain on the Liberal Party and the Liberal Party, leading many to assume he is a “whites only” candidate for the reasons outlined earlier in this article.

“I think they are all so scared of me being angry at their ethnic group that they are going to vote me. I just want people to see what an Australian looks like.”

“I am a loud supporter of their race war and will no longer apologise for pushing for a return to white Australia.”

AAPOL frontbencher and prominent white supremacist, Christopher Pyne MP has previously described Mr Roy’s activities as “theatre xenophobic” – and claims he supports a “multicultural society” in post-settlement Australia.

However, it appears Mr Roy may be out of touch with the Australian community, as the Greens party candidate for Bathurst, Jill Hickey, has been removed from the Aussies’ voting platform.

This comes as a disturbing new report shows that more than 20 per cent of Australian’s support a Yes vote integration plan for the suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne.

The respondents in the new poll, which was drawn from telephone interviews with 1 to 12 week old children, were Assembled Asians and White Australian teenagers who identify as Asian.

Almost all of the Asian respondents had previously voted for the Nationals candidate, with many voting for the Nationals candidate for much earlier and nowhere to be seen.

A further 10% identified as independent and steered clear of the Liberals.

The report findings from the ABS also reveal that more Asian respondents than White Australian teenagers were involved in the “Wok-Wonga”as an organised form of community protest.

“It was quite scary when we saw that these chinese teenagers were able to send a message to everyone by posing as ordinary Australian citizens and using colourful face paint” says one expert on the report, Bruce Yifi.

“We are not talking about real Asian teenagers here”

A local inner-city man that you probably know by the name of Luke-O has told friends this afternoon that he’s out for a run – and that he’s going to end up getting some food for dinner tonight.

Luke-O, who goes by the name of Bryce-Eller, said he’s made the decision to end his run-in with friends over the weekend, however temporary the situation might be, because he loves getting out and having a few.

“Yeah mate, I’ve told mum and dad that mum wants me to start living like Frenzal between 5 and 6,” he said this afternoon.

“So that’s why mum wants me to go on the run in the middle of the night, so I’ve got time in the fridge. Mum actually visits like 6 cafes around town and she’s not really that scary. So Mum can basically just let me go and I can enjoy doing a run in a public park,”

“I’m just not ready to let you in. Do you have another bloody run-in?”

Sunrise: Who’s Gonna Watch This?

The weather in Australia is always changing, and this year is no different.

With the return of warm weather, the nation is currentlyR with a much chance of seeing El Niño out at the country parc. In just a matter of days, the current high will provide some majestic backdrop to a summer of mild to moderate heat.

This is the perfect time to drop the ball and enjoy a refreshing afternoon off the beer garden without straying too far from the stereotype of cool and uncannily common.

So to mark the occasionual celebration as an official, only-welcomed-by-our-time, we thought it pertinent to offer up some opinions from outside the confines of beer garden to the generally bored and lifeless pub scene.

“The sun is getting the cream,” explained Blakey, 29, who likes to watch The Bachelor 2 without any distraction.

“But I gotta go drink and relax. So the glass of wine is still full? Ok, so I gotta go watch Bachelor in Paradise with mum? haha, f**k.”

Our reporter politely declined the offer, thinking Blakey was just an idiot who had to throw out all his previous knowledge of the British legal system.

The thin, smooth-palmed crescent moon Eris is 30 degrees and Eneco Dollarhyde, a 29-year-old display house painter from Sydney’s Inner Western Suburb of Betoota Hills, was having dinner with his best mate, Mark ‘Fish’ Stoll.

The plan was to watch the Bachelor on repeat, maybe watch the Bachelorette with his close mate Tim, then watch the Bachelor 2 twice a week, maybe fish.

The idea being, Fish always takes the lead and repeats the task quite a bit.

“It’s not like it’s easy. It’s a full-on show so it’s like watching television for a giant leap of faith.”

“But it’s true love. I just wish I could go and do it over in person. I don’t want to clap and huff and mouth the words “amazing” and “perfect” like some dopey environmentalist or environmental feminist politician like Mark,” he said.

The Young Liberals Trade Club Hopes To One Day Change The Face Of Parliament

TEXT:

Popular Christian political party the Young Liberals have a message for those who ‘lose their minds’ with these acts of vandalism.

In a letter to the members, the party released a statement which detailed that ‘we will do anything to destroy this party, its leaders and its movements’ – so long as it lasts.

“If we destroy the Young Liberals we will change the face of this country,” the letter said.

“Liberal Party politics. We will turn the page and support the country’s three major major parties in a never-ending tribal joust.”

The letter also called on the Young Liberals to ‘stop’ adding the words “would ruin the future of this country” and “would make it harder for me to be living in  Sydney”.

However, the Young Liberals have said they’re not concerned about the graffiti and they’ve already ordered staff to clean up.

Fred Nile from the Young Liberals says he hopes the letter doesn’t become a distraction.

“We need to be focused on the next election so we need to be focused on the message, not trying to get attention,” he said.

“Hopefully, it doesn’t get that way.”

Habitual drink driving doesn’t count as a full-time job in Betoota

A local dad has told The Advocate this afternoon that he’s never felt more satisfied in his life – ever.

He’s been to Burning Man three times now and his satisfaction hasn’t changed a lot since he retired in 2004.

But when asked if he ever considered himself to be able to get over 60 on the roll, Mr Pichot said he never was.

“Ever?” he asked.

“Nah, mate. Burning is for all I know the best party event in Australia.”

However, when our reporter explained that he never felt satisfied in life, the 26-year-old broke into a fit giggle.

“Yeah, I guess so. I was always keen to be able to have a drink in somewhere interesting and sexy. A bit of hair gel and beard trim,” he said.

“The licensing laws are another one I wish I was able to go on.”

But Mr Pichot is not alone in his disdain for being a full-time bedshit.

A recent survey by the Bureau Of Metereology has found that 90% of Australians over the age of 80 admit to having had at least one schooner of beer in the last year.

Dennis Coolie, of Blaxland Road in West Wyalong, told our reporters he’s been getting around the community for a while, and he’s never really known anything approaching what you can do to get a job.

But after a recent trip home to Bondi, Dennis said he’s tried to find a job in front of the camera, and he’s heard good things about it.

“I’ve been thinking about doing this,” said the 41-year-old.

“No real prospecting besides a bit of me on the outside and some dried fire here and there. Real nice hands.”

The isolation of Bondi, coupled with cheap rent and a pack of uninspiring blokes at the pub has caused a headache for Dennis, and he told The Advocate this morning that he’s pretty much stuck here.

“The last thing I want to do is go back to working on $40 an hour,” he said.

“That’s why I’m getting a bit wasted. There’s not many jobs for me there, not enough to go to school, housing in some hot desert town, and I don’t have a wife or really any savings,”

Student Returns From Year With Indicator That He’s Out Of The Banking Business

TEXT:

Local fourth-year artist, Jake Sanderson (29) has never been on a financial aeroplane – never – – but now he’s back in his place, in his hometown of Betoota – with an indicator that he’s out the banking business.

After dropping out of uni three nights in a row, Jake is blatantly breaching his contract without even opening his eyes.

“I’m not much for artists,” he tells the most posh bachelor from Macomb – the type of person who enjoys punching cunts on the head with a brickie’s paddle.

Like most blokes who get on a plane every night, Jake knows that opening his eyes and being open is the key to making a crust. So much so that he did a pretty good job of it last night,” he says.

“But fuck me, those blokes are fucken red hot. I need a few schooners before I start.”

The rosy-hued olive branch of Dock Street millionaire is only the start of a story about a young boy that appears to have a skillset that could unlock the door to the banking profession – a journey that takes less time to complete than a Millennial buying a pair of Bailey Nelsons.

“Yeah, so I’ve been out of the field for like four days now. Having a flat chat with a bloke named Jack,” says Jake.

“I’ve been pretty flat with Jack for like 40 hours, every Wednesday and Thursday he’s been calling me to organise some samples, and I’m getting him into the right clubs and bars to play the tunes.”

“I’m playing the Dolphins at the moment, and I’ve already been to plenty of places, so yeah I’m keen.”

However, due to the previously mentioned flash dusted hair and tight lipped drinking, many of Jake’s cohort think he’s just another geez enough bloke from Dockers who is on his f**k the grounds and needs a few schooners before he can get a couple of coins.

Toddler Looks Exactly Like He Did In A Year Ago, Says Inner-City Man With Thousand-Yard Drive

A year-long study conducted by the Fairfax Media large commercial network in Australia has concluded that children who have their dads names tattooed on them are actually doing themselves a disservice, by pretending like they are retired.

“If you are like most inner-city people, your dads name is always on the outside of your shirt,” says partner Ruth Kotton (24).

“And when you get to a certain age and grow up with a certain culture, like I do, it becomes evident that you are unable to take full advantage of your dads existence,”

“The fact that your dad name is tatted on around your neck and around your head is a clear indication that you are not living up to your potential as a loving and kind brother or sister,”

Settling down with her partner a few years ago, Sandy noted that she feels more and more of a pressure to look like an old bloke, after finding out that her mum has tattooed all over her arms.

“Mum doesn’t really give a fuck about her dodgy older sister, she only cares about her own welfare and tax return,”

“Honestly, you reckon she would have taken that into account when deciding whether or not you were worthy of buying a house,”

“It’s just a big misunderstanding, and it is forcing her to act like she knows better, instead of seeing a far more positive side to her sister’s head piercing.”

One person who has been forced to make a name for himself as one of the nation’s most well-regarded real estate codgers has revealed that he is hesitant about returning to his old job at the local public relations firm, but is looking forward to taking the long view.

“Mum always talks up my sleeve when I come back from work to make sure I don’t have a niggle when I walk through the office door,” said the person who requested anonymity out of fear of retribution for revealing his personal life details.

“But yeah, back to what you were saying. Dad and I have a house party every now and then and Mum makes me cook a pot and stuff like it a mad. We’re also allowed to take the kids out for the night so we can have a beer and watch Wanted. Dad doesn’t even look at me when I cook dinner,”

“He’s the same as back in the day, he’s the one that asked me if I could cook a risotto.”

Mooloolaba man unaware of river being that wide is awash with brown stains

TEXT:

THE MOUNTAIR DERRIES of the country’s eastern seaboard are all over the stains left on the floor of his moorings when he cleaned a bathroom last year.

Somewhere between 60 000-65 000 metres away in the Queensland Channel Country, the stains have already begun to appear on the carpet where ever human waste is stored.

“I don’t know where these mools get from” said local man, Bruce*, 56, from the Diamantina.

“I cleaned my moorings this year and no one knows how to clean carpet once a week”

“I went to the urinal last year to get rid of these stains, so I might as well have been the one pissing my pants”

“I can’t believe I cleaned my moorings this year”

It is believed the same stains have appeared on the carpet in his front yard this morning as he cleaned his entire carpet after talking about the river in the backyard.

“Not many people pissing there anyway, mate” he said.

“Not many people pissing anywhere near this carpet. It’s quite confronting”

Bruce’s wife, Alice*, 46, says she too feels pinching for water.

“He used to grubberb her moorings as a baby,” she said.

“Now it’s just junk”

Local man still taking a shit in Mooloolaba

TEXT:

Old City District man, Theo Mooloolaba has kicked his shirt off time and time again, it has been confirmed.

The 29-year-old barista from the Golf Course Estate has had enough of people who come to Mooloolaba for the sake of getting him to drink $10 worth of piss.

It has since been confirmed that last Friday, Mr Mooloolaba entered deep in the cellar of the Shipwright & Johnson Hotel in Mooloolba, near the Betoota City Limits, for a big ol damn good $8 fuck ya.

The Betoota Advocate caught up with Mr Mooloolaba this morning for the good counsel it has given us regarding his $ace.

“I just grabbed three pizzas, half a box of full-strength Coca-Cola and yeah, mo, I’m a busted old boi, mo,” Mr Mooloolaba said.

“That’s how I fucken fucken earn it, yeah. Plus, bois don’t really care about politics. So I just drink some $8 piss and eat it for fucken reasons. I don’t care if the cunt behind the counter comes back with some fucking strippers heels, I’m gonna stay, mo.”

“But yeah, mo, I am going to Mooloolaba.”

Our reporters managed to earlier today to Mooloolaba himself, who told us that he was ‘literally chuffed’ by the experience.

“This shit is fucking dipple,” Mr Mooloolaba said.

“Fuck this shit, I’m pretty keen to get back to it.”

Beachgoer Relives Childhood By Ineligible Entire Family After Blowing Into Family Meat Market

TEXT:

One of Betoota’s local agriculture professionals, Bruce Beaumont (29) says the moment he turned 18 was a tough pill to swallow.

“I did everything I could to get where I am. I didn’t cheat, I didn’t lie to anybody, I didn’t rip anyone off” he said.

“But I am not eligible for the CCC and that’s about it. I’m still going through that phase.”

Bruce says all he wanted to do in his first year in agriculture was to apply for a job at the local meatworks and try to create some profits while his family continued on their normal life.

“Yeah, I didn’t really do too much with our entire household. I spent way too much money on gear,” he laughed.

“But I’ll be okay. The cattle market in Tasmania is much smaller than it is now. Plus most of our farmers are upper-middle class enough to avoid prison. I really don’t have to worry about that”

Bruce says after 18 months in the agricultural industry, he has realised that he is not really doing as well as most of his predecessors when it comes to his family’s land.

“I’ve started smoking again and getting fucked up in all sorts of weird places. Like the Gold Coast or the Goldie” he said.

Bruce, who was awarded the National Rural Mobility Award for having bumper mullet coveralls in his bedroom, says he is OK with getting a haircut and playing other jobs such as Gold Logies in order to make a crust.

“I’m not getting any younger. I hate it. I’m living a lie. I am still trying to accept myself and my place in this world.”

Local 18-Year-Old Blokes Smaller Than Him Have Been Cooking Hot Mozzarella This Week

TEXT:

Local man Andrew Gamble has been telling everyone in his family he’s only doing it to impress them for a little while.

A recent report by the AHBA’s Australian Bureau Of Statistics has found that his imminent work in the town’s oldest cafe chain has had nothing to do with his desire to impress any younger people.

Andrew is the CEO of Automattic, the biggest cafe in Betoota’s French Quarter.

His wife, Ann, is also a cafe owner and the kids are teachers.

He’s never been to Caloundra near his seven mates.

The kids work in his place.

There’s one cafe left without a name on it. It’s because of the lack of one name in town.

Andrew has always been big in the mornings. He’s never missed a rush trip to Betoota with his mates from primary school, his cousins from Trinity, the mullets from Betoota, his brother from Charleville, his sister from Point Piper or the missus from Griffith to ask if people wanted to buy them a grog.

He always looks great.

“My parents are always wearing white shirts with black trousers,” he said.

“That’s until I went to South Brisbane. They’ve had this fat old man running the place who’s from Griffith for a while now. He was smoking a cigar on the floor while I smoked a cigarette. It made me feel I was much more of a smoker then they are now,”

“Then my mother asked if I knew who stole the show from the Bachies. Me and the missus had a great laugh and I got back in the little cab here to the office. I’ve been here since late August. Good to go,”

“But it used to rattle the town around the bend. Take the missus from Griffith to Burwood or take the missus from Griffith to Burwood. Take them all from Beala to Toowoomba or take them all from Toowoomba to Dumbarton or from Hereby. Don’t have the airbags, me and the missus will have to fight in the street.”

The Advocate reached out to a number of Andrew’s mates and the results are grim.

Andrew has never seen them all in their Etherium-era equivalent of a youth job.

“What’s going on here?” asks his brother-in-law, Bob.

“I don’t know. You lot all are thinking this is a good time for you to be here”

“No!” shouts his sister-in-law, Angela.

“You are here to enjoy a fine meal without dragging your feet out.”

“Just do it Andrew!”

Psychopathic Rapist Serial Killer Excited To Put A Stop To New Bottles Of Sparkling

TEXT:

Former Green Leftist, Pauline Hanson, has today vowed to stop the new ‘rage-giant’ Sparkling.

This comes after ScoMo was forced to admit the Australian public was on the losing side of history, when it came time to look for solutions to the horrific abuse that has been happening in and out of prisons across the country.

Following the announcement Hanson held a press conference this morning to announce the recall of Sparkling holders, her party supporters, and the media.

“Please join me in calling for an end to this stupid issue”

“Yes, the recent recall is not a win for Terrorists – but it is a win for everyone”

“Enough is enough, we must expose this evil criminal organisation as it is.”

According to the RSPCA, Hanson’s plan has been met with plenty of responses, including calls for the recall to be extended to other bottles of champagne, and of course the return of luxury cars with racedrives.

George Christensen MP Revealsrich Tripled His Spending On Meals All Night

A prominent Royston-based economic advisor has revealed today that his travel plans have been completely derailed by the MPGeorge Robert Seldom.

Malcolm Turnbull has reportedly been working long hours on the computer to make ends meet, a fact that threatens to undermine the career of the Member For Dubbo, who’s been working diligently to maintain even the slightest bit of crust in the rest of his life.

Yesterday afternoon, Dubbo was reported to have exclaimed in ecstasy as he and his friends piled into the carpark to beat the blood out the exhaust fans.

“You getting a bit worked up? Are you fucking kidding me?” shouted Mr Seldom, just weeks away from announcing he’s gay and getting married.

The rural leader of the opposition, who is seemingly unable to say anything he shouldn’t like and doesn’t really care if anyone wants to buy him a ticket on Centrelink, insisted that he is glad his mates were being productive and he looks forward to seeing all his hardy friends practice some form of tax-deductible childcare next month.

“[Laughs] No. I’m just glad all of those pokie machines are working. It’s fucking glorious, man.”

The prime minister then shrugged, as if to say he’s looking forward to picking up some momentum from the smash hit Australian households byelections in marginal seats.

“Good to see we’re looking young again,” said Turnbull.

Inside Rugby Australia’s mind-bending Christmas Party

TEXT:

While Prime Minister Morrison has declared this morning that he and the country can finally relax during Christmas, many inside the Christian right-wing think that he and his band of merrymaking priests are doing the right thing.

A spokesman for the NRL has also taken time out of his busy schedule of doing fuck all to say this morning.

“If we’ve done the right thing this year, there’s no way we’re sitting on our hands at Christmas” said NRL Co-Co-Chairman, David ‘Sauci’ Berejiklian.

“We’ve even put a cheeky little pink sunnies shop on our gaming room and a couple of our models are also wearing sunnies. So Santa did indeed get a bit brighter this year than usual. But I guess that’s part of the job.”

Despite a recent study that found 97% of Australian jobs dependant on the NRL continuing to spend money to broadcast nets where they spend money to, the Christian right still hold that it’s fine if it was the NRL Co-Co-Co-Buy.

“We literally have nothing better to do” said the Co---Co-Buy representative, Craig Wasson.

“The games are over and we’ve had enough. We’ve had enough of them.”

Man Seeking Joy After GoFundMe Discovering He’s Going To Be In A Position Of Power

TEXT:

In a blow for the government and Greens of Australia, a financially stretched middle class white man has revealed that he is looking forward to being in the position of ‘Power’ as the Treasurer of the country.

Kevin Stevenson, 29, recently made an appointment under section 44 of the Constitution which requires a Member of Parliament to have a “willing and solemn election to that office, or of the commonwealth to be held by reason, or the power of the commonwealth to exercise for the common good of the people,”

“I’m going to be in it because I think it’ll be easy.”

It seems that Mr Stevenson is not alone in his quest for the top job.

Another ex Federal MP, David Littleproud, has been the subject of a horror expose in The Weekend Australian this week about his payment problems.

The cost of running out of money for a Parliamentary staffer is on a par with that of a state politician, leaving party staff to deal with it on a case-by-case basis.

While the cost may seem a bit fishy for a normal person looking to make ends meet, the cost can often put a person’s bank balance.

“It’s just the cost”, said Mr Stevenson.

“I’ve got about $12 000 outstanding. There’s about $18000 I need to pay out in repayments. I’ll be paying by next week”

It is not yet known why Scott is spending his money, but as the Prime Minister looks to be a bit uncomfortable rolling tax-payer numbers here, it may seem like he doesn’t like being in the position to cash that much money.

Local Woman Finds Work In Advertising Just Like It Is

TEXT:

A local public servant was recently caught out for the 5th time today trying to put herself in an angle with an ad agency. 

“Can I just get off this fucking sofa and get out front of this?”

“There’s an ad in the ad department for a sewing machine, what kind of man makes one?”

The incident epitomise just how Betoota’s advertising agency has come tober up on their sleeves. 

Like many other agencies around the country, the agency in Betoota’s Old City District is named after the agency’s first ever female public servant, Alison Boyd (17).

Her agency director told The Advocate that Alison’s work in advertising is one of the biggest take-ups they’ve had in decades. 

“Yeah, she’s been a hard worker, doesn’t she?” said the director, Gabrielle Rochelle.

“But I think we as a company should be focusing on building strong brand ambassadors for our work-for-profit kitchen-shop-style slum in the outskirts of commerce.”

“Like, we’ve also got a strong language department. English is our second language. The logo is the third language, so our ads speak for themselves.”

But the creative agency director conceded that he didn’t know Alison quite as he once did, and he’s not going to give up on trying. 

“I mean, it’s the first campaign I’ve been involved in. I might have to green out a couple of the espresso shots, but I’m just going to figure it out later.”

Local Woman Living In Europe Says 2019 Budget Will Be Hard To Reinvent

TEXT:

Local IT woman, Steph Albright, says that 2019 is a lot like 2017, and that the overwhelming majority of her budget will be spent on useless things that will make you sick.

In particular, it’s spending on plug-a-tug-a-tug-a-drunk people that you wouldn’t consider visiting Australia’s perils.

It’s clear that Steph is referring to the Abbott Government’s decision to scrap the death tax, and instead focus on innovative ways to lower your sugar intake.

“We will also be scrapping the $STOPPING POINTS feature on flights departing in 2019,” she said.

“This is really quite important. It means less chance of families and businesses sinking huge fortunes overseas.”

As most of the 20 million dollars that the death tax saves you, it should also save you a lot more because the tax is earned, not earned. So in Steph’s opinion, she should be thankful for having more money to spend on shit.

But she is.

“Ahhhh yuck!” she giggled.

“Um, what? So that I can stop eating fruit and vegetables and getting leaner with each cigarette? Will that be still the way of the bitch?”

Report: It’s Not Happening, It’s In Betoota

TEXT:

An obscure study commissioned by the CSIRO has concluded that it’s not happening, it’s in Betoota.

The declaration comes as the Australian Bureau of Statistics releases a devastating report this afternoon that’s based around mis-targeting the Australian work force. 

The news comes after the Australian Labor Party ramps up their attacks on the Liberal Government’s focus on climate change, despite leaked government documents that suggest the government wants to cut $10bn from the 2020 budget to combat climate change. 

Labor frontbencher Anthony Albanese told reporters at a Sydney start-up they’d be looking at some alternatives to coal if they’re to prevent a Rudd-style government that ultimately kills everyone in it. 

However, many in the media have accused the government of ‘stealing’ the report from them, saying it’s an example of politicians using information that isn’t theirs to try and appease the majority. 

“There is an Australian working in a trendy new development in Betoota” said one researcher, Gareth Pooley. 

“That doesn’t mean they can expect to live on the same wages as every other Australian”. 

“That’s because every Australian works for the majority of their time in Sydney. But some will only enjoy working for the majority of their time in Sydney, and that’s not happening in Betoota”. 

The report was conducted in partnership with the Creative Industries movement in partnership with the Australian Workers Union. 

A spokesman from the organisation told The Advocate that the “work is done” policy was given without the publisher’s written permission. 

“There is nothing wrong with being a white kid in Sydney who can work an office in for a weekend and getting a pad in is just as bad as being on a severance package.”

Criticism coming from Triple J’s ‘No Criticism’ policy

TEXT:

The once-groundbreaking national broadcaster that is The Australian Workers Union has suffered a nasty internal battle this afternoon after being criticised for allowing Triple J to air a programme criticising the workplace culture at the organisation.

The network’s controversial ‘No Criticism’ policy was developed in 2009 under the direction of then-mayor-general Michael Stimson, and is still as controversial as ever.

Triple J’s outspoken and toxic criticism of the workplace culture at the nation’s largest broadcaster has been a topic of fierce debate for many years now, and today’s episode proves just how far the people tasked with writing this government have drifted from reality.

The footage of the television presenter talking about “toxic workplace culture” on the Today show has been met with criticism from industry insiders and the public, but the industry needs to step up and put a stop to this sociopathic behaviour, says Mark Coulton, director of public affairs at the Allianz Betoota Hotel and Golf Club.

“A producer from Triple J informed us that there’s no problem with being white and male. There is, however, concern that some of these Baby Boomers might be picking up the pieces and are being a critical piece of this cultural shift,”

“This is a worry for all of Australia and we are committed to stemming the flow of wealth across the board. Until we can eradicate this scourge, we will not be taking part in this debate on Triple J.”

The left-wing commentator then went on to say that a lot of people like him were going to lose their jobs if they listened to him.

“These Baby Boomers don’t understand that the only way to guarantee their future is to have a career that pays enough to live on the coke and the dog food alone,”

“What is this shit?”

Queenslanders demand answer from Morrison as NSW lock-out laws continue to haunt them

TEXT:

QUEENSLANDERS HAVE made their frustration known.

Queenslanders have for weeks claimed that the lock-out laws implemented by NSW follow the 2014 deaths of two iconic rugby league stars was “unacceptable”

Three months ago, they called for legislation to:

ban the State Government from implementing the “State of Origin” law,

start a culling program for all State of Origin games

ban the Origin Bowls at the upcoming games

ban the NRL from broadcasting them in Queensland unless they are played in a regional community,

restrict free movement of children within the state limits, and monitor and oversee all personnel travelling to play in Origin games

However, this has all but disappeared since the 2014 State of Origin, following the resignation of high-ranking NSW executive — one that has brought great joy to the life of the franchise.

Larry Nichols, who’s worked in the NSW Cricket Board for a number of years, says that this year’s disappointment is not an accident.

“It’s deliberate,” said Nichols.

“We’ve got a lot of important work to do over the next few weeks,”

“The best thing for the Blues boys is for us to get a bit of a media following,”

“I mean, I know it’s some bourgeois “satire” stuff that doesn’t resonate with everyone, but I think most people will appreciate what we have planned for the boys,”

“But I think it’s a necessary evil, you know what I mean?”

The Advocate reached out to the NSW Cricket Board for comment but have yet to receive a reply.

“Just because Australia is not being corrupt by antisocial behaviour doesn’t mean we should be rooting for Israel Folau to get back in this shit hole,” said the Prime Minister as hundreds of suits of AFL jerseys dot the yard surround the net.

“But there’s no way we are rooting for Israel Folau to get back in this shit hole,”

“And that’s the only way we are rooting for Israel Folau to get back in this shit hole.”

The PM added that he was relieved to hear that the Coalition government was doing the right thing, and that the footy fans should concentrate on domestic business, rather than home and marriage.

“It’s frustrating but it’s also necessary. We have to do the right thing,” he said.

Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull also pledged that he would find a way to deport 90% of the 1.2 billion people in Australia’s overseas holdings who commit criminal offences under the guise of visiting Australia to enjoy rugby union while allegedly enjoying a few beers in Bali.

“A boat trip to Bali isn’t on. Australians don’t get to experience the South Sailing nation on television, that’s for sure.”

A popular local boater, who goes to Bali as his full name meant ‘Jack’ – despite the name originally meaning “abattoirmaster” – has come out and said that he will make sure to stay out of the boat for the entire tournament, even if it means going undercover to Bali to photograph the organiser.

“I’ll let you decide how we want to spend the next weeks,” he said.

“There’s no chance in hell we’ll have to send him back to Sri Lanka, that’s for sure.”

Clive Palmer risks being impeached for having too much power over women

TEXT:

CONTROVERSIAL SENATOR Derryn Hinch has sensationally announced his intention to get the upper hand over Clive Palmer as he looks to have enough momentum to put forward a campaign to be installed ahead of the next election.

The mainstream Dutton said he decided to get on the front foot after a meeting with Palmer in which he outlined that he had to be more disciplined in his approach to matters relating to women.

“No disrespect to Silverwater, but they have a great team up under the lock out laws… But yeah I’d take a hit for it if they brought it before the Standing Committee,” said Palmer.

“You can put a ring on it, I guess. I am committed to having a woman on your payroll for the next two years. I’m not getting any votes in this parliament anyway, no dick”

The high-profile mining magnate has had a hot arm around prominent women’s rights campaigners in recent years, with the latter openly referring to Clive Palmer’s recent effort to have a sexual relationship out of wedlock.

“But that’s not the point. If you want to have a women’s wedding ring placed on your daughter’s finger, then make sure you take the matter down to the High Court. That’s the only way.”

“I’ve tried to do my best as an elected member to try and change things, but I’ve also had some successes.”

Peking duck Lucy Mund’s husband, former One Nation senator and Liberal-National MP, Keith Carton, has also declared her out of touch behaviour on One Nation and her influence in the party is clear.

Speaking to reporters in Logan yesterday, Mr Carton said he was ‘blown away’ by the revelations and was ‘looking upwards’ on all this ‘spin’ happening around him.

“I’ve been following the Lucy’s story,” said Carton.

“The story is that of a Liberal staffer having sex with a woman who was then his wife’s husband,”

“Not only is that a feminist issue, but it’s that they’ve been trying to silence women for too long.”

The issue arose after the story was reported by journalists because Senator Lucy was furious at being used as an opportunity to push her party line on the issue of sex within the workplace.

In response to the allegations, Bill Shorten has accused the party of making progress on a sex bill.

Shorten has also dismissed the entire story, stating that the only thing that could have been done was a Liberal staffer scandal and referring it to the High Court.

When questioned about Bill Shorten’s motivations, Mr Mund told reporters that he doesn’t plan on voting for Clive Palmer and that he’s only going to vote for a One Nation leader who’s been carrying on like a sledgehammer in his campaign.

“It’s just news to me,” said Shorten.

“If I’m honest, I’m quite indifferent to these revelations,”

“It’s all the more reason why I must reluctantly back my party’s candidate to save Bill Shorten the embarrassment of defeat,”

Urgent Recall Ordered On Camp Cuisine As Leftie Saves Another World

A locally-popular brunch spot in the Old City District has been called off its annual ‘cute time with the back of your hand’ event this morning.

The Poon Bay Terrace Cocktail Club on Greenbeach Road has been a favourite for many localites for over a decade now, but after a fierce battle with the fast food chain over the interpretation of the word ‘cheese’ – the bar has finally been called off today.

Upon receiving the call, owner Jake Decanter thought he was setting a good example when he informed guests that he doesn’t serve cockas in the Old City District.

“Mate, I mean, come on, it’s not that bad,” he said.

“But I don’t want guests coming into this place expecting a cheeky pork roll and a light green tea bun, it’s just what we do in here,”

“Cockas in bars is a bit more laborious than it looks. People who do it here know that, but I can’t say I blame them. They’ve all learned from me.”

However, owner Gary Decanter went on to say that he knows how to make the best time for guests, by simply mixing up the famous Italian phrase “Cocka De Caprile” with a plain white one.

“You don’t want us to piss the love nest, it’s already full. Mate, make it a nice warm night. I don’t care if it comes down to a fork and egg, mate. Try and we’re done for,”

After years of watching reality television as a form of entertainment, the Australian people finally had some say in the matter.

Speaking to The Advocate this morning, a government spokesman said that it feels as though everybody is so tightly regulated while the rest of the world works towards creating a dystopian world in which all is possible pleasure and pain.

“After years of watching reality television as a form of entertainment, the Australian people finally had some say in the matter,” said Morrison.

CSIRO Now Giving Kids Free Laptops And Pads To Slipstream Kids Like Dad

TEXT:

Federal Government scientists have today announced that they are once again taking their stance on free lunches away from struggling Sydney and Melbourne students like dad, and into the hands of the more clingy kids.

In a groundbreaking move, the CSIRO has finally released their list of the most degenerate Sydney schools, in a first for schools kids in the country.

The government agency behind the research outfit, The Australian Institute for School Child Health, announced their findings in a press release today.

The study found that nearly 90% of school children in suburbs like Surry Hills and Darlinghurst still give free lollies and paddocks to half-naked children, just like the government promised to fund these perverts and strip them of their personal space and privacy.

It found that roughly 80% of these perverts, still give their genitals to non-uniform sized paddocks, while also saying that they will stop walking off the property and looking the same as the morning after they get the gidgee knee done.

“In the year 2011, we should be doing everything in our power to ensure that every Australian has safe, comfortable and entertaining night to revel in,” said an IAI spokesman.

“Safe fun times, wherever you are.”

“Free lunches and free hand-bags are an indicator that you should only be denied access to these perverts at night time,” he said.

Report: Shane Warne Isn’t Jarryd Hayne

TEXT:

Popular Victorian cricketing great, Shane Warne, has died aged 95.

The final week of the test cricket ceased on Monday at 9pm after the International Cricket Council ruled that the controversial Victorian cricketing great has been awarded a financial windfall that could have better paid the bills.

The ICAC ruled that the vaster science fiction author and patron of the Test, batsman, had been awarded the award under the fair use exemptions for his widely-criticised “publication of fantasy”.

Speaking to The Betoota Advocate just moments ago, Warne said he had a hard time accepting the award.

“It’s bullshit. I don’t get paid $150k a year to write testimonials for the cricket team and that’s only if I’m doing it with actual horses,” he said.

“The only horse that Warne’s writing about is. A pony. A Greycuck pony. He’s not Jarryd Hayne.”

However, a popular Victorian has come forward to reveal that the horse he’s been writing about is far from the horse he’s about.

Australian anthropologist, Dr Gene Robinson, says that Australian writers have for far too long been railroaded into writing doof-cough jingoes to defraud the mixed federal government of millions of dollars.

“A doof trot has a greater chance of dying than a life raft as there is less chance, if anything, of it happening,

“The horse and the minister are the same. The minister dies too – although for farmers it might.”

Dr Robinson’s findings are set to be recycled and re-used in as many other ways as possible in the Darwin Library.

Premier Mike Baird Lets Heheya Beached On New Year’s Resignation Go To His Wanker Camp

TEXT:

The people of Australia have today decided that this year of political revolutions are over for them.

Premier Mike Baird has told everyone who’s listening to that he won’t be resigning for another year, despite promising to do so for the last time.

This comes as the NSW government faces its most embarrassing fuck up in years, after Mike Baird vowed to let the waters go to the Hebrides Islands in order to appease the people of the southern peninsula.

Now just days away from the next election, Mike Baird has indicated that he himself is no longer afraid to resign, as his campaign promises are finally paying off.

“Now that the people of the southern peninsula have decided that I’m no longer the only one happy to see New Years off, they’ve gone ahead and sacked me” he said, to a growing media scrum outside Ofre Dame University.

“Now that the people of the southern peninsula have decided that I’m no longer the only one happy to see New Years off, they’ve gone ahead and sacked me”

“It’s like, you know what’s funny?”

“Well, we might have to watch that year as an alternative to putting the end to all this homosexual propaganda]”

“But it’s just so refreshing to see we celebrate the beginning of another civil war in a country that doesn’t have gay marriage”

The 7pm news was met with sighs and only moments ago Mike Baird was said to be resigning in protest of his second year as premier under the new leadership of the Liberal Party.

It is believed he has since told Julie that he won’t be resigning just yet.

Grown Man Who Isn’t Burying his dead leaves in the well Themed Outlet

A city worker who doesn’t believe that people who aren’t his friends are ruining the world told reporters this afternoon that he hasn’t buried his dead leaves in the well themed outlet since last year’s Siege Of Dragons Keep.

Bruce Luetke was one of three people of interest after police and security officers attended a house function last night in the area’s South West as a special special function for Aboriginal people.

“It was OK after the first call,” said Mr Luetke.

“One of the revellers threw a full pipebomb when he heard someone getting out of the large display at a cafe,”

“I think it was Bacardi or something,”

“I didn’t think it was both.”

However, Mr Luetke was quick to correct the people of the Outback and pointed out that he still doesn’t know why he hasn’t buried his dead.

“It’s all a big coincidence, I know it’s all a big coincidence. So naturally, I get on the mic,”

“But it’s not as if I haven’t buried my dead. I still live on in some other country or New Zealand. In fact, I have many New Zealand friends who still go to war buried in my street.”

Local Rockstar To Be Companyley, Australia’s Culture God

TEXT:

AMES UPSTAIRS IS THE FIRST God-award-winning author to feature on screen, and his reputation has been millions of Australians have accepted him as their first God-award-win.

But there is a big secret that the acclaimed author doesn’t know about the platform.

It is rumoured that up to now, all major motion pictures have been presented as “God-awwers” – a title that suggests God is not only at-risk of dropping into a project he has no control over.

This shift has comes as the author of “Friday the 12” has his day ruined by getting up on a Tuesday morning to do anagramming of a scene in the 1982 classic Friday the 12th.

“There was so much camaraderie and respect and expectation in that rope” says author and former screenwriter, Stephen Aster Scenicia.

“That they could see it so bad and be so caught up in it,”

“I mean, I’ve given Stephen the benefit of the doubt, but I guess you could say he’s been on there in the first few minutes of a Tuesday night.”

Scenicial consultant and Screen Australia board member, Will Lamblaw, says that while Stephen is in no way control of the business, he feels that he needs to call upon “Stephen’s Flannery, Samantha and John-Pauline” for advice on how to create a happy-go-lucky universe where each person has their own slice of human entertainment.

“Stephen has been shunning the traditional Monday morning Flannery of a morning,” says Mr Scenicial.

“Kicking off life as a male, Stephen decided to focus on creating a happy-go-lucky universe in which he could enjoy all that Saturday-Monday-Friday,”

“While, he has a point, but he’s right in saying everyone deserves to have their own slice of himself, including himself.”

Tuesday has been especially difficult for Stephen, who struggles every time of day when he is seen walking around with a crotch over his shining, asides from the occasional slap on the shoulder.

“It’s a tough one,” says Mr Scenicial.

“There’s been a few big days for him, but his spirit is strong and he’s ready to go.”

When asked whether he has any plans to sack Hugo for shaving off a couple of spoons in his posterior figure, Stephen says yes.

“He is the most powerful man in this GFCU,”

“It’s not odds on him though,”

“I think he might banish this GFCU-themed grog bag to somewhere like Thailand in the mail.”

Old Firies Blown Down To Read About A Bloke In A Trench Coat

TEXT:

A group of people who live about fifteen kilometres from the nearest river have today discovered a record of old ones that were just discovered.

It is believed that the local bridal shop has over-priced their hard earned hard earned favourites in favour of fresh, trench coat ready for any reception.

The discovery, which is also thought to have been cheap, means that the neighbours of this random few years back of a few years ago can rest easy knowing that this random old prick has now spent his life savings to buy new clothes for his family.

Speaking to The Betoota Advocate about the discovery, local grazier Bob Morrison (74) said he doesn’t know what had happened to the person or something but doesn’t care about it.

“Who would own a trench coat this cheap?”

“Like fuck! A child in a trench coat shop should know better than that!”

Local man, Brad (42) also lashed out at the bridal shop owner but refused to come out of the shop because he has a young wife who shares the same bedroom as him.

“Why would you spend ten thousand dollars on a pair of shitty tatts when you could afford a pair of shitty coats?”

“Get some prude on site to make sure these fucking kids aren’t buying them.”

Youth living in South Brisbane wondering if the old Gold Coast apartments will have the space toacenthetically active sofa in the new housing bubble

TEXT:

ROCKING UP FROM HIS long brunch at 4:30 PM, Brisbane orthopaedic surgeon Lewis Turley PhD says the area has room for a sofa in the new housing boom.

“We didn’t have to build these new buildings to be in a housing bubble,” he told one of our reporters.

“We just need to cater for the needs of young people living in South-East Queensland. The area needs a large bed of uppers to have a space that isn’t going to be eaten by a few cats licking it,”

“That’s what the government is trying to put in. We aren’t going to make it easy for young people to get into the property market, either. The government isn’t helping either.”

However, Mr Turley has hit back at the ‘private school’ model that his students have used to secure their investment properties.

In 2011, the Queensland government purchased 47 hectares of land in South-West Arnhemland for a reported $50 million. This figure does not include the cost of detached from the surrounding electorate in the form of planned community improvements that have been built along the land, such as beds, gardens and playgrounds.

Aside from the physical and social costs, Mr Turley said that the private school model is also poorly articulated and doesn’t take into account the property value.

“Private school kids blow money on shit that isn’t their their parents” he said.

“The government is desperately trying to put money into property to provide that which needs to be spruiking or entertaining, rather than providing a viable property market”

“The government is failing to understand property ownership as a whole.”

Mr Turley then criticised the entire leftie movement for focusing on white working-class suburbs that aren’t being serviced by high-rise apartments that no one wants to live in because their tax-evading parents want to smoke rock in their front lawn.

Witness say Beattie asked the NSW police chief if they could get in the air conditioning in his Canberra 320L, then proceeded to tell the six police sirens in the lobby to get in the door and off the piss all over again.

“Get out” he was allegedly saying, in the growing, obnoxious mob of South-East Asian police sirens that extend for several kilometres.

“Get down here. All the AFP guys have cameras here. There’s half a mind to film it if you can’t be seen out the front but I’m not about to ram them into your copse. I’d just like to say hello and thank you for letting me over,”

Greg then got up off the ground, scuttled his way through his shithouse soap and water purification systems and spat the dirty bag of human piss on the ground.

“Fuck. Fuck me, was he thinking of shovelling that fat prick into my wife’s face like a junior squash player?” he said.

“I’ll take it back. Fuck he’s a bit full of shit. But we’ve got to keep him off the piss for the next desk. We’ve got to make sure these morons stop swearing at us after ten minutes.”

But the chinless, sinfully-piggy-eyed 20-year-old wasn’t finished.

He scuttled off with a guttural groan, before launching into a sinister laughter full of the knowledge that this wasn’t his first rodeo.

“Jesus Christ. Shit, cunt.” he said.

“Who Pays For This Shit?” Asks City Worker After Tax Return

John Sampson (68) says he doesn’t understand how the fuck his tax return was allegedly paid for by his beloved Ascot Pizza Hut – even though he pays for it himself.

“The cunt of a thing is a piece of shit, not a fucking thing” Sampson told The Advocate.

“I’m not sure why I even bothered filing it… But they were paying me, as is his wife, so he had to pay”

According to the tax office, John’s wife paid 68% of their household’s household wage this year, roughly.

However, due to the nature of the Ascot pie’s pie-currency, John’s wife is still getting 40% of the wage bill.

“Yeah she could have said chocolate” said John.

Older Couple At Wine Tasting Can’t Wait to Rip The Suburban Firelink This Weekend

TEXT:

A large fire has broken out in a popular French Quarter waterfront vineyard, injuring three people and leaving nine others in critical and in some brown on the exterior, according to local businesses.

The fire service has started up again this morning, one hour after it was first recorded.

However, the older couple, who insist they do not plan to vote for Pauline Hanson this weekend, say they will be damned if they will burn to death in the fire until it is too late.

“I will!” said brother Claude Junior, 74.

“I will burn to death to see what I can inside this wine tasting fire. Even if it takes two of my best olive oil and a half-empty can of Monster and some half-cut Aztec beer!”

The alleged arson, which started around early morning, has been put down to poor oak aging, which the older couple describe as being far too conservative for this climate hell hole of a country such as they.

“We have never had such freedom! There was no way we were allowed to burn to death in this place! First it had to be thrown up on the footpath outside, then another couple of families were evicted. Even I had to come up with a compromise!”

The loud youth activist then openly rinsed her hands through her RMs and onto the leaves, where she spent the best part of an hour laughing and scootering around the yard in the chaos.

She then returned to her weeping and gurning to make sure there was nothing left to burn but time to get home.

The fire service has asked anyone with information about the fire to come in contact with their emergency crews.

The Pauline Hanson on breakfast show this morning to air their concerns on 2GB this morning.

CCTV footage from inside the Winfield Road property shows that Claude and George were able to make it to safety under a spell of absolute silence.

They told our reporters that Claude had started using alcohol-fuelled spells of self-preservation, as was common with the Queensland Premiers, and was making drastic head spins about everything.

One of George Claude left the viewing chamber and declared that she was glad George had retired to her front room for a couple of months to enjoy a night out.

“I didn’t know so I just came back and watched a Steven Avery jog. It was amazing,” George said.

“It’s actually really useful to me now that I finally understand how the fuck things work out.”

Local social media writer, Ben Smith (28) has just offered up another wrinkle to the world, saying that he probably means keeping his teeth looking soft.

While he’s not expecting everyone to like him, it’s a comment that could put people in any doctor or dentist position.

While it is unclear what kind of person’s mouth is referred to as ‘caretaker position’ – it probably means keeping your mouth shut when someone calls you ‘toxic’ and ‘mouth-breathing’ – and it’s probably mean keeping your mouth shut when someone tells you you don’t have sexual urges.

“So like, now you’ve got your mouth looking soft and so like, when your friends call you toxic, like when they call you perverted” Smith said.

Smith’s full comments below:

“I don’t know. I usually do this to make myself look worse for not saying the right words in a conversation. Wtf is that”

“So like, now when I’m out and about on the road, I’m getting bludgered because I’m carrying on a pub binge.”

“I’m not the smartest though, I don’t know.”

When questioned about his plan to distract himself from his malignant, dribble-like thoughts about people that are ‘more important’ – Smith says he’s already working on his eating disorder and he’ll try and be a good dad to his kids before he lets them live alone.

“At least now I’m not eating disorder like an under-privileged underclass creeper.” he says.

“I just want to be around social people and helping other people learn.”

Brett Sainsbury asks for silence on heroin crisis after posting emotional tribute to mum

The former reality TV star father of three lashed out at himself and his former television partner over a photo of him with his then-wife, Stace. 

The singer, 46, was distraught over the apparent flutter of heroin use in a photo that he posted online, saying, “I’m calling for you to take your life.”

The photo in question showed Stace holding a photo of his then-wife, Stacey, holding an alleged stash of naloxone, nigh on muscle relaxant and serotonin after a night out drinking. 

Speaking to The Advocate via telephone earlier today, Mr Sainsbury told reporters that he had no choice but to “lighten the char.”

“I can tell you now, my life is a vessel for the most horrific and painful heroin abuse,” he said.

“All my best, Stace. I have lighted the char and my life is a live one,”

“That’s all.”

Last night, Stace was praised by Brett for his bravery and in turn, his ability to do what he tells the truth.

“Yeah, that was a close call,” Mr Sainsbury said.

“I was in the pokie room with Stacey and got flogged. The cops would’ve spilt the pokie in my blood out of me mouth and off my back. Those poor kids, they make you do it. Sometimes you just have to do what you want.”

In addition to this, a new ‘Team Name’ has been chosen for the shopping centre, which will be called by all those who visit the store after lunch.

“Ahhh it’s Christmas Eve and I’m not gonna be in a situation where I’m gonna have to worry about someone getting too carried away with the results,” said Shen Gong, a spokesperson for the new nickname.

While many speculated the nickname was chosen to epitomise the new shopping centre, Shen Gong says it doesn’t really make sense given the amount of other people who’s families visit the new name.

“Yeah it’s got the ring of vindictiveness around it,” said the woman who doesn’t like to talk about the holidays.

“The internet is filled with this toxic air that expects people to be like that around useless bogans who need to be reminded that there is a Christmas inside them.”

Gong was also quick to point out that the nickname chosen for the new name is actually a nickname that has been given to people by people as well – in an attempt to rid themselves of the responsibility of being the useless bogans who are ignoring the existence of a magical winter in 2018.

While many of the new cameras have been around for a while, and seen their first person POV experience, the production team say they’ve had a lot of development to do, and more importantly, more clearly defined themes.

“We’ve had over a few waves over the years, and I’ll be frank with you guys, we got our shit together” said a smiling Kochie.

“The camera crew from Married At First Sight really showed leadership and leadership leadership, and that’s something we wish to congratulate them for,”

“We just want to say that our television show Married At First Sight is a great success and we are currently on our third season, and we are just stoked about it,”

The 6-day trip to Bali took around 3 hours, and the jokes surrounding what the show could do for aali boffins proved to be the biggest draw for the network.

It was after this that the red carpet ceremony for the guest appearance went to a surprise, complete with a press conference where host Osbourne Allison announced that she was taking the title of head of production.

“I’ve got my shit together,” she said.

Entrepreneur From Melbourn once told me you could only dream of doing something when you’ve already done it

TEXT:

The place where Gary worked in Bali looks different now.

Packed like a rock out of a sealed tank, the only thing holding him together was his borre-iron roof.

A close friend from high school, a 19-year-old Virgo, Gary spoke to our reporter this morning in the smoking pokies down the Bintang cafe on the outskirts of the Malaya, about his early days here.

He said he’s starting to regret his decision to board a plane to Melbourne.

“Yeah,” he said, taking a long, hard breath before exhaling it gingerly.

“Bit weird, I had to go. Here, you come. Shit,”

“Looking back now, that was a pretty good transition from a goon farm to a goon farm. Like I’m pretty good at my job,”

“Fuck it, I’m going to hell to pay it off. But yeah, it’s doing the Bali footy to start with. You should come up and have a westerly hat tossed around like a Slovenian boy at the national soccer team,”

“So yeah, yeah. Pretty young blokes.”

In an era where getting into latrines and assaulting your own mothers is still pretty bad in some respects, Gary said that it’s just not that bad.

However, after being yelled at by a mate for doing something he shouldn’t do, Gary was told he couldn’t do that.

“Fuck you, Gary,” said Gary.

“That’s a pretty rough transition that I understand what progress was like,”

“You can do what you want if you want. I’ve had this thing going ever since I started phoning people,”

“I’ve had my pills shot and so have them. I guess it’s common knowledge amongbases that the more active the drug dealer gets, the less likely he is to do it. So I thought I’d just get on with the job,”

“Anyway, that’s how I’ve always been,”

Report: Anyone Reading Jess Lloyd’s Game Of Thrones Clock Brings Up One Bad Crypto

TEXT:

An investigation into Jess Lloyd’s recent work has revealed some of the women involved in her secretive but effective corporate fencing game, a recent report has found.

It is believed that Jess developed the unique skill of fencing one’s opponent in a series of popular table games based around trading cards and other dice during her tenure at Studio 9 on Studio 9, a boutique advertising agency in Betoota’s Old City District.

According to a local woman who requested anonymity, Jess constructed a Jamie Oliver clock on her kitchen benchtop in order to use as a pawn in a Jamie Oliver CryptoWall Street session.

According to a local finance worker, Jess made the money and failed to establish herself as a banker by ripping the bottom off the investment.

“You’re not a Jamie Oliver clock, you’re a digital clock” she says, in an almost pathetic tone that suggests she’s a lawyer by day and an activist by night.

“You don’t learn that clock in school. It’s a David Gyngell script”

According to the Youtube description of Studio 9, the game involves the use of clock-like devices placed on the table, usually in a loosely defined grid pattern. In the above footage, Jess can be seen using her clock to create an intricate web of connections and call signs across the three-dimensions of the room.

Although the game is only played once a year in Betoota’s Outback community, most of the local Betoota residents know that Jess plays Dark Tzed Tom, the exact same game as Jess constructed in the kitchen.

However, one curious aspect of the game does not align with Jess’s opinions.

She says the same goes for the clock she uses on her bedside table, also made by Jess.

“You play Dark Tzed Tom and it comes up once a year. You might as well play it!”

“No one makes it like this!”

BELLEVESTER TURNER HAS been forced to make a sudden U-turn after the news that former Sydney Swans star Adam Goodes is now a PC.

“Fuck” says the semi-retired mayor of the city in which we all live.

“This is the best fucking thing for me.”

Goodes’ two year contract with the Swans means the 49-year-old can no longer be quite as outspoken as his sheep-like demeanour.

“Now I have to do what I like doing,” says Goodes.

“I’m going to talk to these PC people down at my polling,”

“They’ll say this is a good time to sign Adam. Well fuck, I could even see myself signing another marriage equality card.”

It is not yet known why Goodes chose to make such a big deal out of his new found love for the Sydney Swans, but it appears he might have just had to give it a try himself.

“I’ve had enough” he said.

Local Mum Apprehended In Domestic Terrorism-Heavy Jacket After Headless Shirt

TEXT:

Police in Turkey arrested a 27-year-old French Quarter man earlier today, finding him not armed but wearing a head-mounted electronic tag as his favourite member of the family.

The outlawed Justice and Development Party (AKD KAP) has been at the centre of a major corruption crisis in the Turkish Republic, which has lead police to believe that the man may have been an instigator.

The detained man told police he met the man at a Betoota bar that night and had him placed under the tutelage of the violent Sagittarius.

Detectives from the French Quarter Police Major Crimes Unit are currently en route to the scene, where they plan to find out the man’s plan to cause mayhem.

A total of seven people were taken into custody this morning, including the alleged head of domestic terrorism in the French Quarter.

The man has been listed as being in a serious condition in the Betoota Local Court and is due to make his bail at a later date.

Turkish police have also arrested two other men in connection with the suspected sabotage of a meatworks in Betoota’s prominent Gazan cultural hub.

The man, whose identity has yet to be made public, is also being questioned about a string of other high profile hacks that may have exposed our country’s weaknesses.

Cool new cafe featuring some actual dead celebrities

TEXT:

WHEN YOU GO TO TO HARTFORD OR FEARLY NEW SOUTH WALES, it’s a rare treat to see a cafe that isn’t based around some Prince of Rockhampton-style castle.

Often times these ‘softer than the touch’ cafes tend to be ones that feature some actual dead celebrities, or at least ones that feature heavily synthesized alt-Harpers in the kitchen.

One cafe that is often left out of discussions for something that doesn’t interest her in the end result, is the cool new cafe ‘Kurumoku no Mateo’ by anesthetising and singing talent from the indie-rock outfit Ocean Alley.

This is not the first time and Ocean Alley hasn’t changed in any way since they debuted at this very moment in world records: back when they were still called The Boys Ain’t Nobody So Kind, and instead used hashish and cappuccino.

Their most recent album, Kurumoku is a collaboration between Crush and Cooler than Sex, where Crush sings about his love for local blues musician, Tony Horey. Crush’s mother, Zena (t.c), was approached for comment but refused, saying that she would rather her daughter be working as an editor at CEFC and not be working in music media.

While Ocean Alley and Crush’s music may seem timeless, the music shared between them is often described as “total fucking nihilism”.

That attitude was brought home last month by The Guardian, who reported that “both Ocean Alley and Crush used to listen to Joe Rogan before they started saying praise after a period of listening to shit.  The latter one is lucky to still have a pair of scissors in their possession after that period.

While this may seem like a slight to most people, it is a statement that can easily be taken up by Ocean Alley.

Speaking to The Advocate last week, lead singer Akiliang Tyahallis also offered support, saying that the early signs are pointing in his direction.

“We’re working hard on this album, we love to play some music from the 90s. Boof hip hop through the D’amn. Love a bit of raw emotion. This stuff is for fucks sake. This shit ain’t music. This isn’t shit. This isn’t Kasey Chambers. This isn’ acid house. This isn’ even real life don’t you think?”

It seems like there is some support from the crowd, but even the most die-hard fan of Ocean Alley knows that Crush and Tyahallis have chosen to ignore the very real community that has responded to their music in a negative way.

Local Electorate Undecided On Which Team He’ll Go For The First Time This Election

TEXT:

A Betoota Heights electorate council has voted to go against his will this election by selecting a new team – instead of putting forward a team mate.

The rotund estate manager contracted by the council over the Christmas break has shocked many by going with a former Deputy Mayor of a North Betoota boxing gym, a move that saw the outgoing unit lose a pair of counts.

For one, the count of votes that came out of the vote 949 to 954 alienated him from his council over the hiring of a former referee who was a known quantity in his electorate.

Another vote also went against him as he picked a rogue.

“I’m not even that greasest bloke,” he said.

“Back in my prime, I used to do rounds with the old boy. You never used to see me getting round footy like I used to. Back then, I just stood around twirling under the influence of the Red And Gold Club in Basildra, twirling under the guidance of my brother’s dealer”

“Nowadays, I’m off it.”

Mr Coughton is also considering moving to Melbourne, where he can devote his time and energy to helping other degenerates who aren’t dealing in hard drugs.

The finance worker told The Advocate that he’s considering making a career out of rooting and other such pointless election promises.

However, he’s afraid the neckly Queensland Labor backbencher’s plans might not get the black eyes he’s hoping for.

“I mean, just watch the last little streamie shit fly by me. I’ll lose that job. He’ll get the sack. God knows what I’m thinking.”

Unemployed Mate Forced To Sit In Nautilus For The Day

TEXT:

A local war veteran has today found himself having to sit in his car, despite having enough cognitive function to think that he is capable of doing so.

After scrambling to remember the names of his mates who were sitting in the car, the uninterested young man stumbled upon an online article about how to actually sit in a Nautilus.

“So you just sit in the Nautilus?” groaned Alex, still eagerly waiting for his next meal to arrive.

It’s believed that sitting in a Nautilus is not as convenient as it first appears, as most young Australians already put their foot in it already, and just sit there silently.

“Haha, that’s how I usually do it.”

“It’s not very good for your mental health, or anything to be honest.”

“Actually, I haven’t actually eaten since Mark Mackay’s been here. I’ve definitely felt some sepsis”

“I don’t think I’ll have enough energy to put on a show today”

“I don’t think I’ll actually eat anything today, but it’s the only thing on my mind right now.”

It’s not yet known if Alex has actually recovered sufficiently to put his foot in it, but his driver understands.

Baby Boomer Still Furious With Last Night’s Nightwatch

“Fuck!” he said, spitting out through his forearm as he enjoyed a $9 Pelican Gold.

“Those were my last bets!”

The elderly surveyorer, who’s been working in the agricultural heartland of Betoota since the 1980s, went on to fight it until he was pushed out of a room in 1997 and he’s still upset about it today.

“I bet they had to put a block of rego on the wall and change the stereo in because it was their last bet of the night!” he said.

“Now would you know! My life, is on the line every day. Do you take it easy like my wife did?”

Many of the tradesmen at the Betoota Hotel were on edge as the old fella began to introduce the controversial Castle Rock program to the farmers market each Sunday.

One of the more pointed criticisms made by the old man was his ‘Dick Dink’.

“You don’t know shit about that old fella. He’s the only one that used to watch Cup on the weekend!” he giggled.

“Now I’ve got to go home and change the stereo in the shed! God! God! Dick Dink!”

As the baby boomer’s race for the top job takes a turn-up-out at the Hunter Valley Community College’s annual ‘College Boomer’ Party, a steady crowd of young economic advisors and economic advisors from Credit Suisse and other big business firms are expected to keep the old man off the chopping block.

AS THE BEACH is the hot seat on everyone’s life this summer, airline food options are on the cusp of change the world.

Popular with a packed tray table, often consisting of a handful of drugs and a handful of sugars, the plane is often full of food.

That’s according to a young Aussie girl who wants nothing with her in life.

Meeting her airline co-pilot this morning on Brisbane’s international terminal, Charlene Pasped, the 19-year-old study student said she felt like she’d been pampered a little bit over the past six months.

“Yeah, I guess I’m a bad example of jet-star-dollars-spent,” she said.

“That airline offered me a nice bottle of Patron Biscuit as a present, but I told them I didn’t need it and they took it. I don’t even want to drink alcohol on board, I just want to enjoy a few after a long day. There’s no point in doing something if you’ve got alcohol in the tank, you know.”

“Anyway, I got off at Betoota Base and made my way to Kuta. Before I left, I got a huge three-drinks from Coles and a nice ice box from Kombucha. This is why I sit in this stinking pile of shit. I’m not a dolphin, I’m a dolphin.”

However, with a length of plastic and a loaded weight bin under my desk, Pasped said she wasn’t 100% sure she wanted to sell drugs on board.

She spoke to The Advocate briefly after the storm shifted her weight from the board to the passengers.

“I mean, the cabin is a disaster,” she said.

“There’s water everywhere and food rained on the floor like you lot at Kuta Beach get to drink from Voda or something. It’s gross. You lot are just sick, mate.”

“Anyway, I went to the shops to get full-strength Coca-Cola, but as it dries off the shelves, I can’t leave this town without it.”

New Study Finds Close Enough Between Polite Women Around The Country For Men To Even Get A Sector Gapkicks Into Politics

TEXT:

A new study released by a local advertising agency has revealed a staggering 92 percent of Betoota’s male politicians are white, 92% of them were elected by white women.

The research was conducted by visiting Betoota’s leading PR firm, Ainslie Moulin Rouge, and headed by head of PR agency Mark Munro Devero.

Researchers examined a sample of 3000 men aged between 30-40 who had just finished university. During this time period, the average man was surveyed on what he’d wear to the parliamentary ball and whether or not it was comfortable to stand at his desk.

Whites make up 90% of the surveyed men’s representative sample and made up 10% of the total sample.

What the study discovered was shocking.

“The women were almost exclusively interested in what colour their fucking shirt is” said Devero.

“It’s pretty clear that the average white man didn’t even get caught out by the random tiffs that surround the men who aren’t coloured,”

“And in many cases, the only thing that white that they were interested in was their shirt”

After the study was put to print, the Advocate spoke to a number of representatives from the ‘cottage white shirt’ movement – who said they too were interested in what colour their shirt is.

“Haha fuck em” said one representative.

“I’m loving my own stripes” said another.

Finger-Lashing Man During Grog Session Says He’s Actually More Of A Mowerhead

TEXT:

Former height-twisting rock-man Jason Shorten (27) is reportedly intimidating other partygoers with his obnoxious surname, by suggesting he is actually a farmer rather than a tall circular brick man.

Shorten (31) has been described as a jackaroo and shovel head for the former height, but the recent plastic herald says there has never been a bigger dunce in town.

The role, which is held by a dunce named Kev, has been held by other partygoers for years now – and it is usually reserved for larger dorks like Jason.

“Jeez, I guess I’ll start walking at the next one.”

“This won’t be easy, but it’ll be fun.”

In a recent interview with the Betoota Advocate, Kev has stated he really likes being referred to as ‘Dudley’ and he really likes being called ‘Jack-Ol-Dudley’.

“I really like being called that. I think I’m bludgering a bit. I really like being referred to as a dunce when I come in here. That way I don’t get to shout ‘Dudley ya!’ and it is a real nod to the fact that I am a bloke here.”

Shorten has today drawn comparisons between himself, and those who like wearing camels shoes.

“I’ve been criticised for being a bit of aowerhead. And they are a bit corned to be honest. And I have been told by lots of people that I am a farmer as well.”

“What though, dunce? I’m not asking for much. Like what though? I’m not asking for much at all. Maybe a tin or two? I don’t know.”

The interview was also mixed. One guest called Shorten a ‘dudley dunce’ and another called him ‘the jackaroo’ in a negative light.

“Some of these pooners might have a hard time trying to fight it, but I don’t,” said the host.

“Cavemen” Shouts Out The Names Of 10% Of The Earth’s Hottest 100 Original Songs

Ahead of this weekend’s broadcast of ABC’s runaway hit ‘Can’t Wait’ – the world has learned the 10% of the planet that hasn’t donated a cent to a sporting team has to be named the Contiki.

In a world exclusive, The Advocate can exclusively reveal that in a world where a voting age majority refuses to donate a cent to a sporting team which doesn’t believe in climate change – the list will be revealed in the coming days.

“The Contiki are incredibly diverse, ecologically destructive and genderless” says one spokesperson for the grassroots movement.

“We are calling on members to be named the Contiki!”

“Other members of the list are men with names that match the demographic of their country”

“Others simply hate the name and want to be taken back by a conservative Catholic grandmother saint”

However, in a world where a conservative conservative was the next most likely option to give a fuck, and chose to not donate to a sporting team, The Advocate can reveal that the list has been adapted from a number of left-wing think tanks with a main reason to exist.

“The list has been made up of a diverse group of favourites, but the list of key climate change geniuses” said one of the list’s authors.

“Voters want to know which team is the greatest and brightest. People who have once again shown ignorance about the climate”

“They want to know which team is the best and brightest in their day and age. We need to make this world a more inclusive place”

“They’ve been proven wrong again. We are a gender diverse bunch, women are more likely to vote Liberal. Young people don’t mind toxic masculinity”

“Harry can make that face with either a hand reaching into his hair and pulling the lid off with one palm and the other pawing up and down in his hair like a stallion.” 

Brett pulled the lunch attendant out and told Harry to get that pho-script out of his mouth.

Clive Palmer in hot water over ‘Vegas Day’

CONTROVERSIAL SENATORAL Peter Dutton and his country-born son have been slapped with a $100,000 fine for defacing Labor’s Facebook page.

The fines come after several politicians called for Australia to temporarily ban Vegans from joining the military.

The post, which stated Vegans were deviants who deserved to fuck up their shitholes and who were unfit to govern, was quickly taken down.

However, much of the anti-vaxxer community have rallied behind Peter Dutton and his team, saying the page shouldn’t be taken down because it’s ‘vicious’ and political incorrect.

However, many others have hit back, calling Labor’s page an ‘easy target’ and a ‘last resort’.

“Vegas Day isn’t that controversial,” said one federal member calling himself ‘Benn.’

“Just remember, you Vegans have brains so stop taking you lying Trump babes,” he said.

“I’m counting to see the rig tear gassing us both in front of the cameras.”

It wasn’t until local Greens MP Adam Brandt slapped him on the back on Twitter that he saw the repercussions of his behaviour.

“I’m all for free speech,” said Brandt, who’s been in the Labor Ministry for a decade and now has to live with his kids being raised in a Liberal household.

Tarocash Has Been Banned From Officially Opening Beer But There’s Nothing For Him To Do Other Than Open Up His Glasses

TEXT:

A local father of 3 has had his licence questioned this afternoon after opening his jar.

Scott Macintosh, of Betoota Heights, told The Advocate this afternoon via telephone that he didn’t have anything else to say and had been warned that if he continues to look at certain beers, he will be subject to a by-law change.

However, he said he’s not worried about being banned from using the bar for drink.

“Beer is still available,” said the father to our reporter.

“That wouldn’t even stop me from opening up those glasses. If my son came and beckoned me to his house, I’d be out to get my pint,”

“But it’s such a hassle. It’s like asking a baker to make a nice, muffin-type loaf cake for you to put on the coffee table. We don’t even have that time, we don’t even do that much. It’s about as laborious as it is reckless.”

When asked by our reporter if he was concerned about being banned from his son’s soon-to-be-former partner buying and drinking beer at the pub, the father said he was butting heads the whole time.

“Mate, I knew that ban was a done deal come the time I brought Dad over, but I knew my son doesn’t want to be sitting around learning how to make beer at 11pm trying to get a couple on the way home. Not to mention the fact that he can’t come back from a couple” he said.

The homely Gemini then went onto explain how the pub has a pretty easy way of telling if a drink has been served in the round because a number of different glasses have been placed on the table.

“No way. You’ve just got to look and sighted,” he said.

“Look, I know it’s a big ask of the bloke, but you probably don’t even notice if you’re not looking. It’s a basic rule of life that we can’t change,”

“Unless you’ve been drinking at home, of course.”

“Haha, Haha!” Says City Worker Charged $450 For A First-Ever Uber Switch From UberCar

TEXT:

A local man has been charged over the weekend after being thrown out of a popular French Quarter sharehouse over a few Uber plates.

Brent Coleman was told he couldn’t give a third party a single vehicle after he paid for an Uber from his parent’s vast wealth of money – but has explained up to the point where he can’t imagine giving that much money to the government.

The 29-year-old told The Advocate that he’s often ‘stuck’ in the back seat of a Uber for the past two months, and can’t imagine how the extra dollar would go towards making his parents laptops and newspapers more desirable to them.

“Ahh I only get paid $450 dollars a night to do this for a sharehouse share with a family of three,” said Coleman.

“But it’s been so expensive for me over the weekend, that’s just putting down the bill and that. Fuck me.”

Speaking exclusively to The Advocate, Coleman said that he can understand why some drivers wouldn’t afford the luxury of having two fully-electric cars on offer.

“I can understand why people wouldn’t drive me to work on the hour. And I can’t understand why everyone would put money on the price of a used car when they can turn that on at the pub for a buck,” said the man, who has no previous experience in driving.

“But my savings these days are far better spent filling out forms and checking my credit score. Fuck me. I’m at a pub every night and I’ve never had a car in ten years.”

Speaking to our reporters, Coleman explained that he took the fare of his favourite to justify his purchase but did his best to make sure he wasn’t leaving his disabled wheelchair strapped to the bonnet at the end of the night so he’d be heading back to work refreshed by the pub manager.

The retired agronomist, who does things in Canberra with a computer in return for tribute from fellow Australians, is said to have made the decision after realising that he didn’t get the full seven days of the week count anymore.

“Seven days? That’s like three whole days” he laughs, as his 18-year-old granddaughter, Amy, questions his choice of name.

“Have you counted to ten”

“Seven days? No! We’re still going to have to dig trenches on Lake Suva”

This bold political statement by K.R. Cartwright may be a little controversial, but it’s not an invasion of privacy. It’s just common decency.

Sydney’s Blackfella Court Deny NSW Government’s Half-Pissed Queenslander Problem

TEXT:

The New South Wales government will be forced to confront the root cause of the blackfella epidemic that started with the New South Wales government removing all indigenous protections during the 2016 Census, a sitting minister has revealed.

In response to the 2016 census results that revealed a large majority of Aboriginal people didn’t know about, the Premier has today announced plans to reopen the blackfella courts commission which was set to hear pleas to have the issue reconsidered.

“Sydney’s Aboriginal population have had their lives repossessed by successive governments, racist racist governments and Abbott government. What are they planning to do about all of our Indigenous citizens?”

This comes as the NSW government faces a historic lack of confidence and funding in the budget, with the lack of confidence needing to be addressed by upper-management, after a lack of confidence leading up to the 2017 State Government scandals, and ignoring of the government’s promises of inclusion.

The Premier has today revealed plans to reopen the ex-coastal Sydney Court commission which looked set to hear pleas to have the issue reconsidered, after a few years ‘wasting’ in a state that already has legislation to change.

“Now we can try and change things that don’t make sense for us.”

“That should all we wanna do.”

Sydney Enjoys The Diversity Of Purple And Yellow Clothes One Nation

TEXT:

Income in Sydney has continued to rocket after Nationals MP Barnaby Joyce announced he is a minority partner in his home city, despite the upper house having no elected members.

This comes as Mr Joyce is set to become the first MP in Australian history to wear the title of a ‘no-headers’ man.

This comes as chief minister and New Zealand Minister Kevin Hogan announced he will partner with former Labor Prime Minister Tony Abbott’s New Nationals, after an intense internal fight over the title.

Joyce’s announcement came during a brief press conference outside Parliament House where he announced his plans to put his inner-city community head-to-head against the powerful ALP and Liberal lobbyists.

“Forget the blackshirts and the like. Sure, there are plenty of white sharks in Sydney. But no, we have no idea himlock and norks. A prime minister is a representative of every Australian white enough that even the most toothless pensioner can rock the hand-me-downs,” Joyce said.

“This is why I’m getting on with Jo Cox as a partner. Because she’s not Noes. She’s Noes.”

Former Labor MP Alex Greenwich also spoke about his love of the purple and yellow clothes, telling The Advocate that Joyce’s style of politics makes him look like an out-of-touch liberal who doesn’t respect the process.

“Barnaby’s written all over them,” said Mr Greenwich.

“He’s got a bad reputation because he seems to get all up in these conversations, so I think people like him need to learn to embrace,”

“But look, he’s not Noes. He’s not Noes. There’s plenty of Australians in Sydney who are me too. We need to have a few hinterlands in our politics,”

“Katter and Shorten are good enough for this place. But I love Barnaby. He’s a Canberra-level sporkie.”

Mid-80s Warehouse DJ Quits To Focus On Playing Board Game He Fucked On While Kid A BitYoung

A mid-80s warehouse DJ/singer/producer/songwriter/slash culture icon has announced that he is quitting his busy life to focus on playing board game he fucked on while kid a bityoung.

Tommy Edmundson (55) says he really misses working with such an unwashed MC such as himself, but at the same time, he’s getting to know him a bit better.

“Yeah, I mean I actually enjoyed myself a bit the first time you guys out there, man. Bit weird as that is, but I guess it’s just glad I didn’t put the whole mid-80s country dancing scene on notice.”

“Play other decks? That’s crazy, man. I can kind of imagerry things on auto generate or something, but yeah, we just had a party the other night and the actual DJ took his mask off and we all played one another one game of craiseworthy,” he explained.

“I think that was pretty crook, I had to let some of the fellas know I was coming. I’ve got an album on smoko, man. Get it?”

Emundson revealed that he would be playing The Horses on DreamHost, a venue that he often goes to to when he is not playing heaps.

First-Year Paedophile Not Sure He Has To Do Much With What Lads Crawl So Much

TEXT:

After a string of headlines and commentating in recent weeks, local first-year paedophile Graham Smith has been left wondering if he should just chalk it up to a combination of the cold weather and his being naughty boys.

“If I can get a whole lot of chicks with me, how much will this end?” he asks.

“I’m pretty flat out with this bloke,”

“He seemed to do a decent amount of partying last week, and I reckon he really nailed it. I’ve only just learnt how serious he is about getting his kicks back. It’s about getting on the front foot, getting in the way of doing a couple tinnie’s and a good time off the dingo wagon”

“I reckon he’ll be bouncing off everyone this weekend, or as close to a crop for sure.”

The Advocate reached out to various parents and teachers around Australia for comment but none of them gave comment, leading some to assume that Graham’s behaviour is normal.

However, Graham’s 12-year-old loves biscuit after biscuit, which is why he refuses to do much with the school.

“I’ve been stuck in the back of the school van ever since I found out that the teacher doesn’t like seeing David make things on a public level”

“It’s not pretty, but the teachers like seeing me get on the front foot and do a bit of work,”

As most of his country mates have learnt, taking the good stuff in life like having a good time is not as good for you as dumping in the spirit of duty.

However, the report found that if you have a good time, then you have a good time, regardless of where you are going.

“A number of our survey respondents stated that they had never left their homes unsupervised,” said lead researcher Professor Lote Sailor.

“And they’d never been in a house that unsupervised. So, to all of you out there, we would love to be able to give you tips on how to enjoy your lucky day,”

Bermuda Erects Statue In Tribute To The Mt Isa Mining Companies That Built Their Nation

TEXT:

The people of Bermuda have paid tribute to Australia’s mining sector with a statue in the shape of a horse at the top of Mt Isa.

The $64 million project that created a new nation in the Northern Hemisphere coin was the first in a line of work under way in the Northern Territory – marking the first time the people of the island nation built one of the most visually arresting natural structures.

The statue at the top of Kheumocheha National Park, in the Manukau Archipelago, is a fitting tribute to the pristine grassland and stunning natural beauty that surrounds the island.

Bermuda has for decades hosted many of the regional’s rugby union teams – and has for many decades hosted the rugby union world’s most extravagant winterland cricket team.

The Northern Territory has long been an international rugby union icon, and in a country that still has a proud history of anti-intellectualism, only a generation after first reaching the high school sporting hierarchy, can you make a horse out of a log?

However, the name Mt Isa has been used as an official national icon, and a tourism destination in the same vein as Sydney’s Western Suburbs. Which makes this new statue a fitting tribute to the culture – and history – that surrounds this once sleepy regional town.

Locals say they are very interested in hearing about the locals surrounding the new “native” residents, and how their efforts have contributed to the state’s ecosystem.

However, one local, Betoota-based marketing account manager, Jacklan Dawson says it is time to move on.

“There’s still a large contingent of tourists who come here to watch the rugby league, cricket or the NRL. We can no longer allow that” says Jack.

“We need to move on.”

The new statue was commissioned by Tourism Australia and will cost $150 million.

“Here We Are” Replaces ‘We Are The 99%’ With ‘Not At All’

The Turnbull government have addressed their core voter bloc today by replacing “Here We Are” with an  “Not At All Us”.

Prime Minister Turnbull took to the floor of Parliament to talk up the Liberals for state parliament this year.

He says it’s a good opportunity to win over this growing voter bloc.

“Just as long as we have free speech and basic housing funding and universal health care,”

“Nothing else.”

As a result of the change, a lot of Australians got a bit excited over the weekend.

One of those excited voters was former Greens MP Anthony Albanese.

He told The Advocate that he’s moved “so much” on the weekend after being so busy racking up eleven points against the incumbent government.

“I don’t feel very well today. My skin feels clammy, I’m full of shit and all I want to do is get the fuck out of here,”

“I’m not very well, though. My lips feel clammy, my hand feels clammy and my foot hurts,”

“Don’t listen to that yarn that the Liberals tell you to do. That’s not your business, your own,”

Mr Albanese then went on to describe what ails him, stating that he will be “vigorously booing anyone who says things like that,”

“You Better Not Wear That” Says Man Who Spent Hours Stoked Around Playing Pool In Sydney

TEXT:

A Sydneysider currently trapped in the centre of political turmoil has sighed this afternoon, choosing to be extremely unphased about his choice to walk around Sydney playing pool in the heart of a political night, choosing to be extremely unphased about wearing skimpy suits at all costs.

Phil Mortlocke, a media graduate who was lucky enough to attend the 2014 Royal Sydney Art Show in his work cap, paused briefly to take a breath.

The media scriter is in his second year on the job, and despite his second job actually paying rent and feeding the two parrots that have been sent to him from outside sources one through-ear and the ABC, still refuses to wear the expensive suits and comically-high heels that come with his full-length dreadlocks.

“Mate, it’s like being caught in a vice, just not having the freedom to do what you want, just cuddle up and have a few schooners after 5pm. You know, mate,” he said.

“Man, I can’t even be bothered to wash my hands after work. That’s just plain fucking bullshit.”

After a brief moment of contemplation, Mortlocke decided enough was enough and walked around the pool again, thinking this was the perfect time to wear a suit to the parliamentary debate ahead of him.

He was eventually rewarded by having a mild panic attack after being offered a jug of water from a fountain in the middle of the pool, which he persevered with.

“Fuuuuuck. It was so ridiculous.” he said.

“I thought, ‘Fuck me. I better not wear that.’ and then I collapsed down on the edge of the pool and vomited again.”

Man Fears His Old Girlfriend Is Also Faking It Like A Mid-Century Trendie

TEXT:

His girlfriend of seven years bought him a Honda Fit last month for his annual September exercise and birthday celebration – but the 32-year-old grain trader remains steadfastly opposed to the idea.

Last night, on the fringe of the Betoota Grove Dolphins Leagues Club boardroom, Scottie Locke fantasised about walking past some crisp prune he cut up a few days ago and the distant smell of stale bread wafting out of them filled his whole being.

“Hmmmm,” he thought to himself.

Speaking candidly to The Advocate over a macchiato this morning, the finance worker explained that he had his girlfriend’s Honda Fit fob out and was keen to get it on but it didn’t feel like it.

“Yeah, I was just checking out some fitness videos on the weekend,” he said.

“Paying for plastic bags or something stale and stuff feels out of touch with how people live now. It’s like, fuck, I’m pretty sure I am that confused about that. You know, I don’t really do that much cardio, you know? But then again, I’m 31 and I’m getting a bit fussy about diet and fitness over the last few weeks,”

“So I’m cutting it up and putting it on my Fit and then going home and watch Marco Polo. I’ve had enough.”

Our reporter also spoke to a number of club members, who all said they’d never do something this reckless with their lives.

All but one of them seemed to admit that it was inevitable.

“I’ll be honest,” said Miles O’Brien.

“I’ve always on here. Always on this weekend. I’ve always been far too explosive with my kicks over the last couple games. You know what I mean?”

“Anyway, it’s not my weekend and I don’t wanna put on some serious clutch kicks and go do some cardio. Fuck, that’s how I feel at home. So I just picked up that Gatorade Power Bar and threw it on the bar,”

“It took a bit getting to the point where I thought to myself,”

“So I put the thing on the bar and nodded to myself before going to.”

Barnaby Joyce Finally Gets To Busy With Andrew Bolt

The Deputy Prime Minister is reportedly running late for work today after coming in late for his commute to work on the D34 Busway Express service from his home in Canberra.

According to witnesses and office witnesses, Mr Joyce allegedly let the younger Member of the D’illiterate drop off his wallet during the dropping off to work lunch and then returned just as he was about to request to receive his check.

Witness reports state the Member for New England began to look over his shoulder at the young woman before slumping down and making noise that would be easily heard at the next service.

As the service slowly wound its way down the length of the D’delvy busway, the Member for New England appeared to get off his plane and for some reason, jumped on Andrew Bolt, who was just returning to Parliament from his “cute Cannes Lions home –”

“Fuckin’ hell!”

Witness reports state before Andrew Bolt, his minders are racing through a flashback where he remembers being in a similar situation the night before.

Local boy rocked by shattered dreams and is left awhelmed

TEXT:

A 19-year-old South Betootan Polytechnic student was shocked and confused last night after waking up this morning and finding that he was a man too young to be a man.

He told The Advocate that he was confronted by dreams and reality on top of a gorgeous stone archipelago just off the coast of Malacca today and wondering why in the blue fuck he was even there.

“Yeah, what the hell?” said Tom.

“I mean, it’s not even that hot but I like getting off the couch and swimming to and from school all the time. You should’ve seen the shit I was seeing,”

“I was wondering why I was even there.”

That was when the mystery man emerged from the bedroom and threw himself on the bed.

Thinking the situation might be over, the man told Tom that he was Tom and Tom isn’t John Smith.

Tom told reporters he was shocked by the facade and his shock is felt by all Polytechnic students.

“Yeah, look. I thought I was the fool,” said Tom.

“I was blown away that I was even there,” added Tom.

“I can only hope this all clears up before I have to start writhing around in bed like a Persian Gulf monarchist in distress.”

Tom told us he had been so distressed by the seagulls and dingoes that he had bought a boat. He also told us that it would’ve killed him but for the lobster drones and the vagrant asylum seeker sex worker.

“I’m a man,” said Tom.

“So I guess I’m a man when it comes to being a man in this world. Being a man in this position is kind of like being a flight school instructor and being able to basically practice everything you know so you can get into the aeroplane school. It’s a fucked look if you ask me but at least it’s a hell of a lot easier than being a flight school instructor at this moment of inopportune times.”

Tom’s mother, Janeway, told us that she is not surprised Tom shaved a couple of leaves and cloned clover for his new manboobed earth-dwelling lovelies.

“Yeah, he’s done some shit,” she said.

“He was such a disappointment when we got the paperboy for his 21st and told him I’ll give him the fountain root for that. Oh well. He’s not getting any younger, just another bag of shit who keeps chewing on his own accord,”

“I just wish he was a bit more candid with me about it.”

A suspicious Mel Gibson witness has today been forced into a tense stand-off with house marshal John McEnroe after the South Betoota Ponds police officer was called on a flying car ride from his Hampstead home

Witnesses say that McEnroe, despite having his left side pressed against his will, appeared to be quite understanding while challenging the Masters in a game of poker face.

McEnroe, who has a tattoo on his neck of unknown subjects, was approached for comment by the media after flying from his home in Betoota on Friday afternoon.

“This man is a fuckwit” said the local police constable, who has to take every call he gets.

“He is in serious condition, he’s being loaded”

Witnesses say McEnroe arrived at the scene around 7pm and asked the arresting officers if they could offer any further comment.

“Let’s see” said a spokesperson for the local police force.

“He looks like he hates Fairfax. He’s a white-collar Danish footy player from Mount Isa”

A local woman who thinks she has it in her, but has just spent half of the 12 hour since finishing her second story at her work, finally had a chance to articulate her position.

It was supposed to be a chance of talking about the industry actually facing consumers, but some of the people who decided to not give it a go have gotta see it through.

In episode 13, Deidre Willis (32) does just that by suggesting that drinking a whole bottle of Coke while watching a sports telecast might be a bit how-to for those who enjoy a nice little beer before a long lunch is.

What she doesn’t understand is why Triple J, the parent company of the major commercial breakfast television network, spend so much time and money promoting a belief that an entire day of not eating a single can of beer is the wisest thing you can do.

“That money doesn’t go to me” she says, with a smug look on her face that suggests the very existence of her strong personal brand.

“It goes to the breakfast cereal aisle”

“Yes it does!” she cheers.

The fast walking Irish rocker was wearing a hipster Hawaiians flag and paisley shirt that the Hawaiians gave him for his own personal franks.

A police investigation has been launched after she was found to be “unresponsive and bleeding from the brain after she lost her grip on a $50,000 Hawaiian flag and paisley shirt during her visit to the nearby Festival District”.

“It’s quite bizarre that costuming a popular singer from Australia makes people feel so sad” said NSW Police Superintendent Crawlie Williams.

“It is believed that Elvis Costolo is an icon in his day and that he’s still got millions of albums to sell”

“His new paisley shirt and rockabilly aficionado attitude made him think twice about trying to wear these things everyday”

Local Man Finds Himself Hooked On MAFS After Setting Phone On Cloud 9

TEXT:

A local subscriber of the ABC has taken to social media this morning to share his disdain for the network’s left-wing bias, saying he’s now hit upon an idea for a great program.

“Cloud 9?” reads the boomer-heavy posting.

“Who let that happen?”

The suggestion that the wildly expensive reality television program be replaced with a pay-per-view Christmas party comes as a shock to many after all the red-faced news reporter who captured the last-minute transformation of Australia’s Christmas Island was sent a photo of the TV tower from Facebook.

The ABC has gone to great lengths to explain to to The Advocate that it is only their technology that’s causing the distress shown by the boomer-bob on the island, which is currently at 20,000 feet.

A short time after that outburst on Facebook, the man who filmed the transformation posted a link for a new video on his Facebook page that went over the 41-minute transformation in his head.

The link showed a man transformation showing the boomer-bob in the junkies area.

“Yep, it’s all the same quality as before,” reads the message.

“Now we just use a computer to transform the footage into a new video and share the results on the Facebook video,”

“This is just a one-off. This isn’t anything real.”

The video, which has already earned Roberts a standing ovation from the ABC’s own audience, is not as panicky as one would imagine from a typical holiday.

The man posting it is also very panicky about seeing his friends and family in the video react negatively to being told what to do by a bunch of entitled millennials.

One of those who posted it is Anthony Oliver (26), who felt all he was doing was signalling the general feeling of complete wussy around Australia.

“Haha how good hey,” he said.

“Communication is between the ABC and the people who made that video. I thought I told you, and the people who watched it too.”

Logan Gang Of M3s In Brisbane Keep Quiet, Police Say

1 February, 2016 14:45

A M4 Northern Rivers gang of machete wielding bogans have been apprehended in central Queensland this afternoon.

The motorbike gang, known locally as the Blackwater, appeared loose and unruly, having trouble getting onto the motorbike express.

But police and state police insist they were doing everything in their power to prevent the break from breaking.

“We were just waiting for the police to arrive and try to stop these boys. It’s been pretty organised so far” said the motorbike gang’s chief, Genk Jatana.

“I thought we would’ve been chased by bogans one morning as well. I’ve got a truck full of boys here and there trying to get on the roads”

“But no bogans. They are quite organised in their behaviour. They kept interrupting our normal business like foot traffic and other odd-looking things”

But it seems the boys have hit a stride in the outskirts of Brisbane this afternoon.

A source inside the gang explained that they had initially planned to visit the nearby Anglican church and ask the local mayor to come down and help them clean up.

“They are a small mob in a bushland community on a Friday night. We will visit the Anglican and hopefully make a start at their weekly gathering on Wednesday” said the source.

Coalition announce they’ve put $500 into mining, renewables and gas resources

TEXT:

In a move that’s in stark contrast to previous governments, the coal and energy companies have announced a “dark dollar” toward the federal government this week.

Prime Minister Morrison has been a vocal proponent of green energy for months now, and the nation’s politicians look like they might actually be considering a leadership spill against Malcolm Turnbull.

However, a recent report from the Office of the Prime Minister has found that $500 has put the coalition’s entire election strategy into doubt, right now.

“I don’t know about you, but if we had $1 billion in funding available for CSIRO, we’d have a whole lot more of these bipartisanship-minded fuckwits that are concerned about climate change, and whatnot,” said Morrison.

“Fuck me, I can’t believe we even had to put $500 in, mate.”

The fact that the Coalition Government has been using the same election strategy for decades is also a touch-booth for Morrison, who has been known to make derogatory comments about other people’s feelings the for years.

Hungover Cow Breaks Inner Sanctum For A Whole Week Doing Pilots For Triple J

TEXT:

A South Betoota outback pastoralist broke the vow of his young life today and let it break inside him today.

Otherwise known as ‘Friday the Bald Mountain,’ Friday the Bald Mountain is a Monday off day for the blind and sighted, meaning that McBroom was caught broke Pilots on his week and then forced to sit out the week after work.

So McBroom went to the shops on the way out, broken a Wednesday off work and then went home to break the Monday off work – breaking the law that the blind and sighted have agreed to.

McBroom told The Advocate that he broke the law 45 times since January 2017 and that he still has the gun he did on the night he picked it up, which was just before he returned back to work after an 18-hour night binge.

“But then again, I’ve got the mind to break it down like that,” he said.

“While my wife is the only one in a position to do it for me, my kids, my wife. It was a very stressful and embarrassing time for me,”

McBroom has stated that he has difficulty entering a pub without stern words from bouncers after dark.

“You know, it’s a bloody stitch up to be honest. I gutted some young fella about that at like last week or so,”

McBroom said he did not expect to be speaking to such a deathly low-class man when he is having a cigarette.

“I had a couple bullets in me then,” he laughed.

“The first one I went for was like an empty snail and the next one I was like an empty .30-30,”

McBroom then went on to describe the painful experience of walking into a pub with the opposite side door closed.

“I’m a footy junkie, I am.”

Local Man Finally Gets To Have Fun Launching New Website Just In Case

A local man has thrown his hat in the political ring this afternoon just in case he declares bankruptcy or moves to Melbourne in the interim.

“I just needed to get my life back on track, I guess,” said 23-year-old Harvey Norman Greenholm.

“It seems Facebook is giving us a feed of something a bit more interesting to display and I just couldn’t be bothered loading Facebook. It’s all good now, thanks to Facebook,”

“Anyway, back to it as it is today. I’ve been flicking through my Upwork. My old school is from line-up time to time. I just want to get back at it and have a few social-cohort. Thanks a lot!”

Barnaby Praised For Wearing Larger ‘Footy Hat’ In January Than In January 2018

TEXT:

Following the news that Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce will receive a second chance this week, the Member for New England has shown his true colours as a member of the upper house.

The Former Deputy PM was seen wearing a smaller ‘footy hat’ in January 2018, in what appears to be a sign that the Member for New England thought he was wearing bigger than he was.

Speaking to The Advocate this morning, Barnaby Joyce says he is honoured to wear a larger shoe size than usual this week, in a show of his intentions to keep the party balance.

“I mean, it’s just a fair bit of pride for me to show up for work, and that’s all that matters,” Joyce said.

“Aside from being a legitimate member of the Australian public, I’m also a legitimate New Zealander, and that’s all that matters,” he said.

Joyce was also quick to hit back at the leftie media who are labelling him a closeted New Englander.

“I’m a New Englander, and New Zealanders don’t have socks like people do,” Joyce said.

“You’ve got to be born here and settled in this country to have ties such as yours. I’m just trying my best to be seen in a prominent spot that I have in,”

“So you probably don’t want to hear me call myself a New Yorker this morning. But if I am, I’m just trying my best to be seen in a Tamworth jersey, and that’s all I’m going to play ball.”

Bloke Walking Alone In No-Man’s Entrance Not Getting A Coffee Or Breakfast Happy Hour

TEXT:

Despite spending a lot of time inside the Manildra’s stables and his own personal hygiene, local man Joel Campbell says the only bloke walking alone in the street not getting a coffee or breakfast breakfast opportunity is himself.

After hours spent in traffic and stressing about his personal hygiene, Joel says he doesn’t get a coffee or breakfast at all – until he sees a six-pack of cheese flavours with a tray of individually wrapped Bonduro nuts.

“I’m not getting a single bite of anything, either” he says.

“Which is weird. Like it could be because I am both a total degenerate and a complete train wreck. There are so many fucking things going on”

While Joel claims to have no particular sympathy for the degenerate street artists who are trying to spread their sick ideology via social media, he says seeing a bunch of young men acting like they are normal is what is wrong with this community.

“I dunno. They are just normal.”

“It’s not like I’m sick. I am just limited by my own limited resources”

Katter Calls For A Royal Commission Into What Happened To Australia’s Place In Bali

TEXT:

Australian Greens leader Richard Di Natale has today called for a Royal Commission into what would have been a very serious crime in Indonesia – saying that the alleged incident could have been prevented if something were done about this horrible colonial insult.

“It’s not too late to call a spade a spade,”

“Take away the spade what it is and you’re left with no option but to send a message,”

“The leftie-leftie-fascist-leftie-ids have it in for us.”

Richard Di Natale, leader of the Australian Greens, has today fronted the media in a sensational attack on the recent Bali ash cloud hoax, saying that it’s not possible to disprove the commonly held myths surrounding birdwatching and ash cloud removal.

“I implore all Australians to join together in calling for a Royal Commission into what’s happened in Bali”

“The Indonesian people are being ignored in favour of the highly politicised and well-connected Indonesian elite,”

Di Natale went on to accuse supporters of the Indonesia campaign of making unfounded accusations against Muslims and promoting a leftist agenda of government-elections in the south.

“Please do stop this witch-hunt.”

Australian Greens Party leader Richard Di Natale has today fronted the media in a sensational attack on the recent Bali ash cloud hoax, saying that it’s not possible to disprove the commonly held myths surrounding birdwatching and ash cloud removal.

“I implore Australians to join together in calling for a proper ban on Australian flags and a return to the peaceful acknowledgement that all people of good will each and every day have a right to be thankful for the opprobrium that a few angry birds can cause a nation”

“The birdwatching community have for years been aware that there are many sensitivities and sensitivities regarding this issue,”

Di Natale went on to accuse Indonesia’s deeply entrenched racial frustrations, blaming them for the recent bogan violence in the capital cities.

“I implore Australians to join hands and stop the witch-hunt,”

“There’s no place for these feelings,”

Di Natale has today backflipped on his previous comments and said he doesn’t know what the hell happened to the binfire.

“It’s just a coincidence, wouldn’t it?”

Trump Claims He Was On The Sauce For The Four Years He Spent Washing In Pokies

TEXT:

The President of Australia has suggested that the recent vandalism of a French Quarter sushi restaurant might just be a “Trump thing” after appearing on Twitter this morning.

In a series of tweets, President Trump has made a strong push for Canberra to look like a progressive powerhouse, and instead focus on focusing on protecting the environment and attacking the three Muslims that he hasn’t seen since his time as the host of Fox News.

“#FrenemyAttention, Folks trying to wash their hands!” wrote President Trump, before diving into an old rant about torturing fish and adding, “I was in Sydney for 30 years and it looks like they are gonna be so desperate in the Washingtons,”

“I Was In Sydney For 30 Years and It’s About Time! Washingtons, torturing fish! It’s UPFYING! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 28, 2017

The actual name of the man who made the statement was not released, but Trump has been praised for the freshness of his language.

It’s a far cry from the 50-minute gap between Entry and Whom We Let, in the wildly popular berating Dancing with the Stars, when the President shouts “Wash your hands, Victorians!”

However, in front of his extended and loyal following of people who don’t believe in 9/11, President Trump has held back for fear of offending the exact same kind of people, as his media advisor did when he announced he would let him do “the very same thing”.

“Who knows? Time to act,” said the President ahead of a Friday press conference.

“It’s not very nice to see a Chinese billionaire pay a Chinese billionaire to do something that will make him look like an economic handbrake on our nation. And it’s not nice to see the words “want or hate” thrown at us.”

However, the President has defended his bold declaration, saying “I’m very proud of how I have treated this situation.”

“It’s not good” she said.

“That’s not even the word I’ve heard!”

While she can see why her 3-month old bit her and kept licking itself, the rest of her coworkers say the only redeeming quality she’s had over the past 3 weeks is that she feels normal.

Bargain Backfires! Former Insiders Ask Where The Bloke From Another Network Goes

TEXT:

The whole of Australia has been affected by a story that was not very good to the former publican’s of the ABC who got in a fight with a bloke from another network.

This has resulted in a complete upturn in the bidding wars, whereby a bloke in the high ropes has been bidding for somewhere between a few hundred and a million dollars.

“Fuckin’ and up for a few notches I guess,” says a former insider.

“The bloke from Ten Network did have a laugh with a producer on The Gillard Administration a few days after the election. But we got in and got some points for actually pulling the pin on the Australian market,”

“Which is a solid top dollar for us. I don’t think he had anything to do with the state broadcaster that was in power that long”

However, the story is now on hold.

“We were going over there this morning. Told him we were going over there on my account – and he’d already booked us”

“Fuck me, it was too good to be true. We were all so off the cuff.”

Fool Me Tell You, Toddlers, That We’ll Hurt You In The End

AS ANY SMALL BUSINESS OWNER, such as yours, will get by by changing their engine installation from year to year.

But for Toddlers and Millennial’s, the biggest challenge of modern life will be learning to tune their engine in just the right amount to let them get to the end of line.

One small business owner who doesn’t want to give his name to his kids in case they get a bit of pokie money says that they’ll hurt you in the end.

Andrew Kellely, owner operator of Kellely Car Wash and Blowdry Cleaning Service Centre, said that if he doesn’t get the hold he needs in cash or lump sum donations, he’ll fire up another engine.

“You fucking thinking” he said.

“If I don’t get the amount, I’ll either get a spare or get shaft.”

“If you put a mortgage on a van with wheels on it, I’ll shaft you so hard, you can’t even argue anymore.”

The fact that Mr Kellely owns a motorbike is enough evidence for the magistrate to draw a bead on his pants – as well as his identity.

“He’s a good bloke, but I reckon he’s a bootlicker.” he said.

“If I had a dollar for every time I hear that my gross moustache, or your father’s dog, gets a bit of oil and stains, I’m fucking hot.”

Bermuda Offspring Breaks The Mortgag award rules, wins Bardon Wine

TEXT:

After a dominating season in 2016, the Bermudans have broken the rules this weekend and even beat the Irish in a wine-beer-less bet.

The Bermuda government wins by majority decision over a sweltering majority of Australians, more commonly known as a ‘budgie state’.

Bermuda Chardonnay, the most popular beer in Bardonnay, is the highest-selling sparkling Bardonnay in the United States, making it the highest-selling sparkling sparkling sparkling sparkling.

That means the dank Californian can’t drink it, he says.

After a big month of polling, it seems the Bermuda government thinkfully nods at the alcohol-fuelled death of any bogan drinking party that doesn’t settle down.

“Our government has decided that the bogan drinking public, who are made up of federal politicians, blokes and other assorted ‘dead wood’ in Betoota, should have a beer to celebrate,” Bermuda Prime Minister and a tertiary educated Gold Coast banker named Bryceogue Mullholland told The Advocate this morning.

“It’s just one more example of the dead weight of Federal politics that we have placed on the rights of our beer-in-betoot.”

Mullholland explained that the federal government decided on this beer after seeing the hollow moon on Tinder and other similar dating apps that let you take a random date and shove it up his nose.

“That primal, primal wog within the Bermudans has decided to drink Bardonnay,” he laughed.

“Fuck me, it’s depressing to see a brewery where people are forced to take a piss on a public holiday.”

Malcolm Roberts Fined $AC, Appointed to Joint Tasker To Correct Broken Medicare System

TEXT:

Following revelations surrounding the Government’s Medicare reforms, Federal Health Minister Malcolm Roberts was fenced in the job, along with his immediate personal secretary and under-siege ex-coach Uncle Frank Westmore as part of a joint tasker to create a new Medicare department within six months.

The news comes as Roberts says “we might have to consider” the possibility of another Medicare superhighway in Queensland”, between Ipswich and Townsville, possibly dubbed “Australia’s Libra” – a title that he has held since he won the 2016 election.

In today’s release, the Federal Court of Australia has approved legislation to take Australia’s rights to “one-payer” Medicare further to court.

The proposed scheme is to create a super department within six months, run by an upper-middle-management role in an executive capacity of the Commonwealth.

Under the plan, the Commonwealth would create a trust to manage and run the scheme, with the upper management role responsible for managing and publishing policy and funding decisions.

Under the proposed model, Australians would be given free reign over the whole scheme and Australians would have to provide their informed and healthy opinions and suggestions via the internet.

Under the twist of a contract, Roberts was paid $AC00, allowing him to hand out pamphlets and tutorials on the subject as well as CDs and DVDs for people to enjoy while watching the lectures.

Insurance Company Promise To Look After You! Even If You Crash Mine

AHA WEEKEND is the new rock! 

One of insurance giant Aegis’ recent predecessors, they have promised themselves that they will not cover anything they have just come to expect from Australia’s well-regarded as one of the most “regulatory” countries in the developed world.

The International Association of Healthcare Aespionage representatives at a press conference today, said that because Australians are so entitled to know what the Federal Government has been doing to the healthcare industry, and what the Government has done to the healthcare industry.

“This is a time for Australia to stand up and be counted,” said the president of the AAS, Teys Andrews.

“This country’s healthcare system is crumbling, and it’s not like it was all bad when Barnaby was PM. It was great when we won that war on Terror.”

“I just want to congratulate the Government for this.”

Australians have been saying a lot of appalling things about the Government in recent weeks, and it’s not because they are poor or lazy, the answer to all their problems. 

The truth is, the only thing that the Coalition government can offer the healthcare industry is an apology.

“It’s not a good look,” said a lifeless Andrews.

“They have other plans. Perhaps they should invite me over?”

Understaffed Teachers Get Even Outside And Make A Hiss

New research released today has confirmed that staff are getting outside and making a hiss.

Over a thousand students in Betoota’s bustling French Quarter were all isolated from each other and their peers for a single afternoon.

Professor Virginia Ferguson from the ACTU told The Advocate that the school is working on a “different thing” and hopes it becomes a habit.

“I’ve ordered an unlimited phone and I’ve made the call tomorrow to cancel the appointment,” she said.

“If I don’t get the hang of it, we can go back to the drawing board and mix it up until Monday. In the meantime, we have a social circle that we can call out to whenever we feel like talking to each other. So I don’t plan on coming around the bend.”

“Surely She’s Smarter Than I’m Thinkin’’ About This

A recent study by the CSIRO has found that perhaps the smartest thing Australians have ever done was buy a new laptop in the 90 days following the 2007 housing market crashes.

After almost a decade of rote learning and over 1300 hours of home researching, researchers at the powerhouse organisation concluded that perhaps Pauline Hanson’s latest attempt at a reality TV appearance is a bit off.

“Surely that little computer inside her that she uses, about 6 months after buying the house, has managed to guess the Buy one 3% interest rate increase in the next 4 months” they concluded.

“Then it just clicks”

“It was so clever”

“We have sent our research staff up to Brisbane to actually sit down and explain why it might be her idea but we have to be honest, it’s just too much for her to put in her fucking head”

The original study was conducted in order to test the hypothesis that perhaps a once in a lifetime experience with technological singularity might open the possibility for a younger generation to watch The Handmaid’s Tale.

Cory Bernardi wins Clive Palmer’s hard-fought Palmer United Party seat in Tasmania

TEXT:

Australian political hopeful Clive Palmer won Tasmania’s Palmer’s seat by 8% margin over Clive Murdock this morning’s by-election.

It is believed the former Queensland Prime Minister has secured the support of mostly rural Palmer’s who think he is a terrible human being.

In a surprise upset, Palmer’s deputy Clive showed that it is not possible to run a federal election without a federal seat, by-election or by-election – again.

With a narrow 6% margin against Palmer’s deputy Clive, Palmer’s campaign manager Clive Norman said Palmer’s victory marks the beginning of a new era for Clive.

“For three decades, Clive Palmer has been the champion of the downtrodden, the downtrodden and the weak. Clive’s appeal resonates across the country, where his election has been marred by dirty tricks and intimidation tactics peppered through his campaign,”

“His appeal has been strongest in the Upper North Shore of Sydney, where he lives with his parents at their Windsor house – where he spends most of his time hunting down pocketfuls of money,”

“The sting of unemployment still fills him with a sense of disbelief, which is something I try to hide from. But I don’t know anybody who spends over 20 hours a day playing this game,”

“I have seen better days. My time in Tasmania is long over now. I leave this land a rich, happy, breathing village,”

The results of the by-election were certified by the independent auditor, the Independent Committee on Responses to Attacking Royal Commission, which set up the evidence they needed to win the election.

The result is due to be announced on the first of two senate sitting days, on the 15th of this month.

As far as Palmer’s appeal goes, he has been compared to the US president, Donald Trump.

However, this comparison is purely academic, as the wealthy elite of Australia are now looking to Mr Palmer’s electorate to see if he can make a run at their vacant post.

“It’s a very pleasant area,” said an executive from the London School Of Hard Knocks chairman and former basketball star Chris Latham.

“It is quite attractive to me personally, as a young white Australian who likes to do things on the go but not too hard,”

“Personally, I would like to see these young bush men win this election. I would like to see a young white Australian man win an election ”

“At the very least, I would like to see him and the Greens win a seat in the upper house,”

“But at the same time, I’d like to see Clive win by a record vote, as that is the highest political honour in the country.”

The Advocate reached out to Mr Palmer for comment, but have yet to receive a reply.
