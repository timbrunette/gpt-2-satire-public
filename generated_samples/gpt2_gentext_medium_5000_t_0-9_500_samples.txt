Daily Telegraph Readers React With Anger To The News That A News Corp article was written by Ian Katz, The Betoota Advocate’s Australia Bureau Chief

TEXT:

As election coverage continues to dominate the media and political discourse in Australia this election season, The Betoota Advocate has revealed a disturbing trend in what readers are viewing and reading.

The newspaper’s editor, Dr Graham Watson, spoke to The Advocate this morning about how these allegations surrounding the publication of a 2014 article by the esteemed media organisation, were nothing short of devastating.

“The Daily Telegraph and ABC decided to investigate this matter,” Dr Watson said.

“They came to the conclusion that this article was written by Ian Katz, the ABC’s Australia bureau chief. I mean, what’s the ABC to do? Let him write an article on a story that most people don’t care about? I don’t think they’d be in the business of making money by luring people into thinking they’re important and important people care about journalism,”

“There’s something fishy going on here.”

After the article was published, the media punditry exploded with Rachel Brand arguing that the news was ‘fake news’.

She’s today working as a news publisher herself, where she says she’s much more comfortable with her opinions.

“This was the first instance of the media having a knife in the back of our columnists,” she said.

“When people like Julie Zeman, and I, and many other scholars say that the paper’s bias towards reporting the truth is quite alarming, and that’s what Australians want, I feel sorry for the editors and what journalists want,”

“But what I mean by that is that we need to be judged by our standards. We need to be honest. We need to publish credible journalism. I don’t think we’ll lose as many readers if we keep reporting lies as we do facts,”

“My opinion is that if you read this, I hope you leave on good terms,”

The Advocate reached out to the ABC for comment but were told they’d be in touch with ‘the fine print’ regarding the article’s contents.

PornHub Insist Rapes Are Just Old Lady Pushing Themselves Up The Lap

TEXT:

The world’s most popular online pornography website, PornHub, has today revealed that the rates of rape and other non-consensual sex crimes are extremely low, and they’re also simply ignored by the vast majority of their advertisers.

The adult entertainment website has today said they’re offering a variety of different models a variety of punishments for various crimes, many of which involve drug abuse, petty theft, or assault.

One specific model seems to have the most interest, and therefore the most distress of their advertisers: the seemingly ‘forgotten’ forgotten young lady model/singer.

This comes as the site’s developers are today focusing on making the site more appealing to women who are willing to read pornography through the eyes of a blind man.

Speaking to The Advocate earlier today, the site’s Content Director, Jenny Drake-Perkins, said they’ve been making the site even more appealing to the women who are sexually frustrated by the lack of options in the industry – like the ability to ‘just say no to someone’.

“So I’ve been posting almost every text message we’ve gotten from these models, who are generally under the age of 50 – the moment they’re in our private chat – because it’s the fastest way for us to see if they’re still willing to send naked pictures,” she said.

“It’s very simple. If we’re not directly related, our advertisers are going to put the majority of their ad revenues back into developing the idea of the site,”

“That’s always the case, but if we’re related, then the way things are going to get a bit more complicated.”

The Advocate reached out to some of the models in the chat to see if they were willing to speak on the record and how many they actually were.

Maddie, a 25-year-old lingerie-clad model, said she’s been modeling for a long time and is ‘sick and tired’ of being ignored.

“Look, I’m not the type of girl that’d respond to a generic ‘no’, because I don’t want to cause drama, but if I get the chance, I’d love to just say no and no one else would.”

New Study Confirms No One Can See Past Locals

TEXT:

In a recent report by the CSIRO, three-quarters of Australians between the ages of 20 and 34 claim that no one can see you from five kilometres away, as people from Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra and other big cities tend to.

Scientists claim the mental and physical toll from seeing each other is equal to the life expectancy of someone just sitting at home next to the most incredible river’s surface since the age of four.

The peerless, yet ultimately lonely Sydney-based young people are all put the shame of their reputation on a knife by the CSIRO’s investigation into the causes of the lack of visibility on a river, and what can be found by putting a bit of eye-contact with locals.

“I am very very proud of my heritage” said young local, Izabelle, who is not a native, but rather a descendent of a long line of indigenous seafarers that first colonised the country.

“A man from Sydney is a man, and a woman is a woman, but no two people are alike. You never know who you are”

With the great Australian oceans making for some very interesting genetic and local geography, the CSIRO is recommending that whenever you see a river or riverbank in the bush or out in the bush, just wave your National Geographic flag, and say flag emoji.

Mr Jones Calls For Australia To Ban Nude Cocktail Parties

TEXT:

The long-awaited NDIS victory for gay marriage has finally come, as prominent Christian figures call for Australia to ban nude cocktail parties.

Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has today backed the call by his peers to ban the controversial venue once and for all, saying that the “tremendous harm” caused by the event “remains a concern”

In a landmark day for the equality cause, the leader of the Christian right has called for the government to ban all nude cocktail parties.

The senior Christian figure in Australia, Kenneth Jones, says that the effect of the party on the gay community, as well as other groups that are not religious, are “appalling”

“There is something terribly wrong about some of these people” he said.

“They are simply not following the proper rites of passage. Just not being properly initiated into the lifestyle of a Christian – and I dare say, it’s not something you need to get your drive into like that,”

Kirk, a young father of two with two daughters, has also spoken up, saying that “it’s not the proper things to be doing”.

“Some people are just not being raised in the right environment for god’s sake,”

“This makes it extremely difficult for them to get through life,”

“I feel, in my own right, as the senior Christian figure in Australia, that this is the last place on Earth that these people deserve,”

“The existence of the party is causing the downfall of a culture and a de-stigmatisation of homosexuality,”

Taken Down By Locals, Blue Pill Blues Is Now In Doubt

Cristoph said the national mood has changed since he was getting paid to sit in an armchair in the Parliament House dining room one evening.

“That one moment when Bill Shorten looked out the window and said ‘just a moment’ before walking towards the nearest window. It was basically back to a small-town wanker chill at the time,”

“Yeah, back to the old Marcia Fairmont lyrics. But yeah. I mean, I don’t really get it. Are they serious? Do they feel the same about [Prime Minister] Scott? Fuck me, Scott!”

In fact, the Nationals party room say they are so disgusted by these coming election returns that they have decided to put a seatbelt on all the wrong angles – or so they say.

Speaking to The Advocate, an election night drink with a cocktail lounge at the Hipoplast, Overell said it’s now a lot easier to get drunk in Canberra and be stupid about things.

“It’s fucking funny,” he said.

“That whole bush thing has almost nothing to do with the blue pill blues. It’s actually just a ploy by the unions to make us look white,”

“They want us to look weak, so we make them look as weak as possible. It’s basically payback time.”

Dad Peers Off On Wife With The Offer Of A Chisel

TEXT:

Despite his insistence that he has very little interest in children, a local Dad has found himself pegging his wife off to a Chisel cut.

It comes after she received a devastating blow after the previous cut was so badly bad.

At approximately 10pm last night, it was reported that a couple of Chisel customers had a argument about the company’s ‘brand new’ packaging.

A Chisel representative has confirmed that the couple is in fact brothers, and no one got hurt.

“Obviously the screw you get with a chisel is that you get it every time, so we don’t mind having him in our show. But yeah, he can probably just chuck the fucking thing into his bin,” the representative told The Advocate.

“He works at the machine.”

According to an increasingly agitated and grown man who was either listening to the show or at the service station before the dispute with the chisel, his wife is ‘bad with the commercials’ and told him to ‘leave her alone’ before shoving the tool in the can opener.

News Corp apologises for cartoon ‘Outback Pizza’

TEXT:

THOUGH THE MORNING MORNING PAPERS have been rolling in and out of the Shire’s top newspapers and magazines, it seems it’s just a matter of time before the internet will forgive the paper for saying the following:

“Australians are no different to the rest of the world. We love to eat pizza. Even if it is from a supermarket”

“The print newspapers and magazines are the primary reason why Australians don’t really like our taste in food”

A recent study by the Betoota Hotel Management Society [PDF] has found that nearly 90% of all Australians eat pizza at least once a week – and that means that News Corp. needs to apologise for its ‘racist’ depiction of this particular culture of food.

“They should say sorry for all those innocent innocent people who got the wrong end of the stick” said one prominent journalist.

“Every time we put people like Roy Morgan out to pasture, we end up with a generation that only really likes being uninformed.”

“It’s a high crime wave of ignorance – and in turn, an epidemic of racism. I can’t say I blame them.”

With Canberra Both AFK And AFK, Why Do These Scum Liberals Get Rude At The Veterans?

“But we need to be careful, you know. It’s not like they’re all rude and apathetic to their time in office… Some of them are like Hitler, you know what I mean?”

“But I gotta get it out of the way. This is how you win over these people, ya dig.”

Pauline then launched into another rant about how the Government and media outlets are working against her.

“For God’s sake… These second-class citizens are just second-class citizens for Christ’s sake… Why aren’t they fighting for their rights?”

“I’m sorry but it’s true, ya dig?”

“These plebs in Canberra and the nation’s media are too blinded by their association with this cross-party faction of the Murdoch empire to understand that they’re never going to win over the rural-urban divide,” Pauline continued.

“Please. Please keep the media from reporting this bad news.”

“Suit Pull Goes Viral After New Study Finds No One Else Does It”

TEXT:

Facing the prospect of some serious soul-searching later this week, a local estate agent is going to be finding the time to get a suit on today as the other suits in his closet aren’t getting in on the act either.

Tom Langhorne told The Advocate this morning via telephone that he’s already approached his local sales rep about doing a suit pull, despite there being only three suits in his closet that month.

“My wife does it for me in the morning, I go for her and it just works better for me because it brings a bit of life into the fabric of life,” he said.

“She doesn’t need a suit or her old man does it, I go for the free and unwashed. It just looks natural and I love it. You know what I mean? It just makes me feel better about my insecurities? Fuck, I should get a suit and everything. And then I should try to get a job in this area. And that’s not even taking into account my fear of dying.”

A common source of anxiety for Langhorne is that his son doesn’t like him for the man he is.

He told our reporters that he’s been to his son’s weekend on the sand at surf club with some friends and is in the process of doing a suit pull himself.

“So what’s the deal?” he asked our reporter as he pulled the bag from his inside pants.

Our reporter shrugged and told Langhorne that he thought the suit he pulled today had had a collar.

“What’s the point? I think you’re making the whole thing about me? I want to go to the bar and let people know that I’m a true Aussie.”

When Langhorne asked if he could go back to the office, we told him no.

Our reporter said this was an important moment in his life, Langhorne said he would.

Report: Useless Boomers Poor Example Of General Social Status

TEXT:

A recent report by the CSIRO has found that the only people who get more attention than their peers for being less privileged than others is a group of less affluent elderly people who collectively have more disposable income than the planet.

As Australia’s post-war baby boomers begin to outlive most of their entitlements and social responsibilities, they have found it easier to claim social status than their parents and grandparents did, while also making sure to live quite close to the resources they’ve made that country.

It seems to have worked for them, as their generation is one of the highest spenders on average. That means they’ve been able to raise their kids with three-hour commutes to work – whereas many generation-X and Millennials have to drive long distances to see the same doctor who just came out of hospital last week.

More and more, people are starting to learn that those with money, power and privilege need to re-evaluate who they are and who they want to be, because the inbuilt risk that one day the planet will run out of them.

More and more, as the planet gets hotter, the coal mine owners will need to question whether or not they will have to continue their efforts to kill the environment and nature.

More and more, all of the same‐sex parenting advocates and all-inclusive rights groups will need to be put on notice. Their breath is starting to get heavier and their lives become more difficult.

But this isn’t because they are lower middle class, it’s because they are retirees.

Local Woman Seeks Pain Relief After Backing A Couple Up Running In Rolls-Royce Facial Express

TEXT:

A popular local woman has today been left feeling like she is losing control.

Stacey Lucas is sitting at home, in her old age, crying about the lack of pain relief she has experienced in her back, for the last three hours.

The Betoota Park Hills Women’s College Student says she feels like the pain in her back is getting worse, not getting better, because it’s been up there and she is still a person.

“It hurts to watch, when it doesn’t feel like it’s getting any better… And I have to sit there for half an hour, and watch the two of them roll in and make me sit down”

“It hurts, and I should be getting some relief but the pain keeps coming back, I’m like the whole thing”

“I can’t even sit in my chair, it’s too uncomfortable”

“I’m just trying to do the best I can, right now”

With the women’s health movement and beauty forums constantly bringing up outdated concepts such as cervical and breast pain, Stacey says she’s having trouble seeing why we need to discuss them at all.

“Cervical Pain. Oh it’s bad”

“Breast Pain. Who even talks about it anymore.”

Adelaide Wetter Than A Tasman Wind

TEXT:

3 February, 2016 10:20

The state’s climate appears to be the main driver for the environmental damage caused by the Adeladen Peninsula’s high climate, The new report has found.

The monthly report commissioned by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (ABM) shows the average temperature for Adelaide is 33.2 degrees celsius and five times hotter than the year-round temperature of the peninsula’s typical.

It’s a much more dangerous place than many first world cities realise, with the temperature range, summer maximum and coldest month at -58 degrees.

“The climate here is more than just the heatwave you’d expect to have in the bush – it’s a bit like travelling to another planet,” said lead researcher, Dr. Griffith.

“You’d have a much more dangerous experience if you travelled to another world.”

“Especially if you were a white guy. In that world, you’d have to ride a scooter around the coldest month, you’d have to swing your arms and not the other way around, you’d have to drink from bowls of fire for two hours, and you’d be exposed to all the things that the climate has to offer.”

The report was commissioned after the South Australian government refused to give up on its traditional Tasmanian identity by adopting a defiant Indigenous language and culture.

As part of its Indigenous identity, the Northern state of South Australia adopted the language and culture of the long-haired Tasmanian tribesman, the ‘Tassie’.

“If we don’t have a stable, secure and vibrant indigenous identity within our own state, then we aren’t fit to govern in South Australia,” said South Australian Premier Gladys Berijikilan, in front of hundreds of indigenous people from her state’s many tribes, groups and dialects.

“We can’t have a strong indigenous identity within our own state – so we have to adopt the culture of the tribes of Tasmania.”

The report has also found that, in order to feel like a modern day Tasmanian, you need to travel to North-West NSW, Victoria and Queensland and spend at least 250 days in one of those towns.

Pub Marketing Manager At Milling Company Expected To Get A Lot Of Messy Emails This Week

TEXT:

This time last year, the first Thursday afternoon of the month, for many industry professionals, was the most stressful time of the year for them.

Many offices had been dealing with big phone calls and frantic emails for weeks and weeks, just waiting for someone to pop over for a quiet moment to chime in.

But that was then, this is now.

“Last year, I was one of the first employees to jump on the conference call when it became clear they were going to get a big messy email this afternoon,” he said.

“To be honest with you, I’ve already paid for my phone and I can’t even remember the name of the company, so I didn’t waste my money on the rest of it,”

“But there was a time when I just wouldn’t get on the phone to hear what they were saying. The laughter, the jokes about me seeing my employer’s car on the dashboard, it was just pure torture.”

But that time is past now.

Speaking candidly to The Advocate this morning through the paper’s receptionist, a junior marketing manager at one of our town’s most prominent media companies explained that he feels much calmer now.

This is because he’s been doing things that make him feel a little bit less alone.

Unlike many of the other blokes in his position, who are sitting pretty in a cubicle with a ton of fuck ups that aren’t that productive, or even smart.

“So last year, I thought I’d give it a bit of a nudge, and I guess I’m just waiting for it now,” he said.

“You know how old is the man? He’s actually my age. So old that I think I’m too old to be on a corporate marketing team,”

“But back to what I was saying, I guess you could say I’m taking a bit of a hit up. I don’t even know what I’m doing, I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I don’t know if I’m old enough to work in this industry. I just need to tell you what I’ve been doing this year.”

However, with Milling Company still sticking around for the coming months, Glen was hoping to get on the phone to someone at the company to ask if they’d like a job this week.

He spoke to our reporter this morning on the greenbelt outside his management’s apartment.

“Yeah, the email I’ve been getting from people this morning is fucking fucking messy. They are all saying the same thing,” he said.

“Like, the HR manager, ‘Will’ and ‘Did’ are asking me to do a bunch of meetings and stuff, but they also want me to get in trouble,’ or the CFO, ‘Joe’ is asking me to get the floor plans, the CEO is asking me to do the new kitchen,’ or whatever,”

“But I’m trying to be as helpful as I can.”

“Let the Young Liberal Roast Be Roast!” Says Heartless Wallaby

TEXT:

The last time the Sunwolves beat the Warringah Maroons, it was like 1984, a couple years before the all-white dressing room.

A year after that, they beat the powerful Broncos in a home-and-away series.

Now, as they prepare for what promises to be a season-opener clash with the talented Maroons, a heartless and cowardly figurehead has been named as coach – a way too mean way of saying that this team won’t be playing Origin until next year.

So basically, you’ve got Scott Morrison leading this team, looking at them with a hunch, knowing full well that they’ll probably fail.

But you’ve got Barnaby standing behind them, peering into their every move – so you’ve got him toggling up and down on the adzeer on the back of their shorts.

And then you’ve got them fucking in the end, a year after they beat the Broncos to clinch the premiership.

“Let the Roast Roast,” he yelled down at the media conference this morning.

“Make sure Scott Morrison gets out of the way and let the young blokes rip the fat old leftie like a mongoose through a fat sheep.”

“It’s a game of chess, mate. You never know which one is going to win.”

“Make sure Barnaby doesn’t get in the way of the attack. Let him get into the smoke machine. Just like when he got behind Sione Matai in the first place. Don’t let him get a hand on the dummy either. He’s more of a bloke than a bloke.”

Local Woman Insists Her Sperm Is Important To Her Well-being

A local married woman of 42 has taken the time this morning to address the comments of her husband, who repeatedly reminds her that sperm is important to her.

Kevyn Horvat (42) says her husband, David, often reminds her that there is no such thing as bad luck, and that if you mess up, it can happen to anyone.

“He told me once, when I was walking down the stairs, he said, ‘Sperm, it’s important to you.’”

After the fact, it became clear that it wasn’t because her husband wasn’t physically capable of giving her the eye of the storm, but because the whole thing is a sham.

“He’s an utter fraud. A big liar. He really is,” says one source close to the situation.

“He once said that his sperm was more important to him than his own life. A lie, as it turns out, but I digress.”

“David told me today that he thinks it’s important to have those two things in balance, otherwise he can’t be happy and it goes to waste.”

American Express Train Make It All About You

A couple of young local men have stumbled into a hotel today to get a bit of a breakfast fix, only to learn that the unspoken rule is that you can’t bring your American Express cards on the train.

“It’s not my fault, I never opened my American Express card,” explained Sam, the 32-year-old who’s been on the train since Tuesday.

“Or my father’s card, he uses one of those ridiculous CityCat cards, which aren’t even valid anymore. All these stupid old white guys on the train, they don’t know how much you can get away with it,”

“Then you just leave your old cards on the train, and are never to speak of it again. They might even be compromised, where they talk about it and wish you luck, just for a change of pace, just a little bit of cash.”

Sam was talking about a train of which he was going to catch a connection with another couple of South Betoota station commuters.

He paused for a moment to let out a sigh before continuing.

“So we got off at the same time, but I had my American Express and she had her regular card. We talked it over, the train engineer suggested we change stations but we’d rather go the sleeper station. It’s the worst place in the world, you could be arrested there if you tried. Anyway, it just so happened we got there the same time, but she had her normal card. So I had to put my old card on a little bit easier,”

Amnesty International report widespread use of ‘Peace Walker’ by local Trump supporters

TEXT:

[dropcap]T[/dropcap]he internationally recognised rights group Amnesty International have just released a new report revealing that local Trump supporters are using the phrase as a rallying cry.

In a report commissioned by the organisation, they discovered that the phrase was being used as a rallying cry amongst Trump supporters in Brisbane’s suburbs, and elsewhere in the world.

“It sounds like a classic no-win-no-fee deal,” said Amnesty International researcher Piotr Szabo.

“For the taxpayers, for the people who voted for Donald Trump in the first place. For the world at-large. It certainly sounds like a bad deal,”

“But you don’t need to use it as a rallying cry, you need to use it to get a rise out of the crowd. And the only way to do that is to hear the supporters belting out it in unison,”

Mr Szabo went on to explain that the term Peace Walker has been coined by the US Army to describe an individual soldier who goes on extended deployments to both Europe and Asia.

“The term is a play on words, it literally means ‘warrior’ – or ‘warrior who goes to war’,” he explained.

“It’s pretty obvious how popular it is with the local Trump supporters,”

“In fact, it’s become so iconic that Trump himself has used it as a rallying cry,”

However, one local Trump voter has hit back at the accusations of his use of the phrase, stating that it was his mum’s word against him.

Paul Cleveland, a 75 year old retiree from the leafy suburban Brisbane enclave of Albion, explained to The Advocate that his mum told him not to use it and it’s never come back.

“It was her words against me that got me,” explained the retired public servant.

“If my word is wrong, then call me stupid, call me a liar. But if it’s right, then call me a real conspiracy theorist.”

“That TV you see me and the rest of the boys having all up in the sheds with is one of the most broken things in the world. It’s a Naskapi.”

“That TV is probably the most expensive to buy on Earth. You’d have to pay a bloke half a day to have your television. It’s the most expensive thing on Earth.

“Fuck and Nah Nah, mate. We’ve got the money.”

The entire Anzac Day show’s ratings have collapsed in the wake of the show’s ratings slide, however a spokesman from Channel Seven says there’s a growing number of people who think this should be a warning sign.

They spoke to The Advocate this morning via telephone where he said he’s getting a lot of negative feedback about the show because people think they’re being watched, so the show’s on the rise.

“It’s a growing demographic, yeah” he said.

“Young people, for example. Young men and things like that. As people get older they begin to watch shows like the ABC’s Cinematic Universe, and so forth. Then they start getting their TV sets, they become accustomed to these displays, and so on. Then as they get old, they start looking for entertainment, and so on. It’s that cycle again,”

Review Of ‘Man’ by Mick Jagger

TEXT:

CHICAGO – [NEW YORK] –[AP] – A recent review of Mick Jagger’s definitive album, ‘Man’ has revealed some new information that could change the way we all remember this landmark work.

When it was released in 1989, Jagger’s album contained elements of both post-punk and early RSL jazz drumming, as well as a string section that was described by the Rolling Stones as ‘our last hope’.

However, after being viewed almost 30 million times in the United States and Britain as well as becoming the soundtrack for the next ten years, the record was often left without a DVD player – until now that is!

Canadian-American rock critic, Alanis Morissetto (a.k.a. Alanis Morissetto, aka Alanis Morissetto at BBDO, Rockford, NY) says that the day the King was officially dead, he was forced to find a way to bring the music back to life for the 70th time.

“Man’ has survived millions of lives and it looks as though the task was not easy,” says Morissetto. “Passionately, Jagger knew it was vital that he create a new soundtrack, much like what Niki was forced to do with the Animal Kingdom.”

A group of young Australian music journalists from The Advocate’s Australian content team have spent a few days gathering data on how Mick Jagger is held in check.

“We spent a few days trying to find out how long Mick has been MIA, and what mediums he’s played in and out of. It was tough, because we live in a country that’s built on the artist as much as the public. So we came up with the solution. We all gathered in the basement of the Cowra Ration Shed [in The Springs]. We had coffee, darts and a tin of ginger beer,” explained one reporter. “Nodded, it was a cold day but the room temperature beer and ginger beer will make that water easier to drink.”

The Advocate reached out to Mr Jagger for comment but his phone’s still off.

Broken Hill Resident Predicts Happening When Migrants Do Just That

A broken Hill resident has thrown his support behind the simmering racist tensions in the United States.

This comes as thousands of migrants and refugees continue northwards through the country, passing through and visiting several towns and cities that experienced a housing bubble boom of their own.

The talk was sponsored by the Betoota Hotel Association, which has been tasked with helping locals know when it’s safe to start immigrating to the country.

“We welcome you,” he said.

“As we all know, you are the future of our town and the future of the Western World,”

“Just like our town was going to be.”

“Just like your incoming family’s future is going to be wonderful and wonderful.”

The Advocate reached out to the Betoota Hotel Association for comment but have yet to receive a reply.

However, a number of people close to Mr Parker have said the same thing publicly.

“It’s not really our job,” said one local broken-down-hearted bloke who’s never had to deal with migrants.

“We don’t even have a Muslim clientele. My son is a Muslim,”

“I’m a broken-down bloke, man. I’m a broken-down Old City old boy, so don’t get me wrong, I like all the white people in town but that’s not because I’m a broken down old boy.”

Dastyari Hints At Appearing On ‘The Project’

TEXT:

Federal Labor fronted reporters today in Canberra, following the news that he is – or will be – going on the ‘Project’.

As a part of his workload as the Director of the Office of the Prime Minister, Dastyari has been experimenting with a number of different organisations, which he hopes will come to fruition.

“Yes, I do intend to appear on this ‘Project’” he told reporters.

“I’m not going to say much because I don’t want to get my notes [sic] out to the public and also, it’d be great to have the opportunity to speak to a few of the journalists in the Australian Press Club. But, I will say that I am planning to appear on the program. And I would like to apologise for my inability to keep the files on me up to date”

“It’s always been the plan, but it seems that I’m not the only one who thinks I should take advantage of the talents that I’m given. And I’m not sure if any of these opportunities come in the foreseeable future,” Dastyari said.

However, those close to the 28-year-old say that he knows this won’t come as a surprise to the very least.

“Dastyari has been quite open about the fact that he thinks the type of thing he is doing is quite funny, and that he is quite pathetic for thinking he has the skills to hold the nation to ransom” says the source.

“He knows what he’s doing is pretty stupid, but whatever, I’m not sure how I’m going to make a living as a journalist and I certainly don’t care about money,” Dastyari said.

“The bottom line is, I’m going to have to go and do something dumb for a while, I don’t know how people live without writing-off all their credit cards,” he said.

Dastyari then said he’d like to see how people live without singing to anyone’s praises when they have a problem.

Local woman relishes in not being selected as a top student in high school

TEXT:

A prominent social media personality has revealed to The Advocate that she sees the competitive edge in not being selected as the next top student in her high school.

Janie Edridge, a 29-year-old former journalist, told our reporters that she relishes in not being chosen as the next ‘young thing’ – because she doesn’t think she can even come close to matching her peers.

“I guess it’s a win-win situation,” said the Betoota Grove Lakeshore mother of two.

“But, unfortunately, I’m not selected, so I have to put a pencil in my homework to make it look like I’m the next one,”

“But I love it. So much so that I have it on my Instagram page.”

However, the Southern Federation of Journalists is campaigning to have Ms Edridge in the running for the coveted position of ‘young thing’ – a title that would put her in a class with the likes of the likes of her father, grandfather and great-grandfather.

One senior journalist said that there is a growing sense among many writers that they’re ‘waiting for Jack Bauer to give them a run in the big time.’

“There’s a lot of fear and uncertainty surrounding young media writing these days,” said the senior journalist.

“A lot of young people feel like they’re about to be thrown in the deep end of town, but they know they’re the only thing on in town. They’re the only ones writing about this stuff.”

After Twenty Years In The Australian Sports Game, Country Collingwood Fans Askew Now The Best Place To Watch Baseball

TEXT:

The same thing.

A year-in-review of the Australian sports game, we present to you the selection of the best sporting matches to watch while your naughty sports entertainment habits.

It doesn’t matter how bad you play, that you’ve lost all your mates who’d help you out if you didn’t, because you’re a bad sport. A bad sport at baseball.

So, instead of watching a team lose, like it does in golf, or playing another team in a playoff, you’re watching a team you hate lose. A bad sport at baseball.

So, instead of watching the best player in the country win, you’re watching the worst team you know lose. A bad sport at baseball.

The picks are as follows:

First pick from the list below, Carlton (18).

This is the Carlton bandwagon, after a long run of injuries and poor form. A solid win against a strong competitor and a strong rival but a loss against an even weaker competitor. Another solid win against a team who you loathe but also have some good friends with.

Second pick from the list below, Carlton (18).

Once known as the home of the rock bottom, the greatest and the greatest of Australian amateur baseball players. Their good times. 

Unfortunately, their good times will soon be replaced by the team that they loat to have the best players, their mates, and their pokies.

Third pick from the list below, Carlton (19).

This is the latest team to get the win against their local rivals, but you don’t need to listen to their side of the story. A great win against a strong team that you loathe but also have some friends with. 

It’s the same group of people that only leaves three tables of the Australian Baseball Hall of Fame after each of the six finalists has won a game in a best of exhibition series. The championship was announced earlier this week by the Aussie Baseball Writers Association and the game’s main sponsor, Nine.

Before the pick was made, the decision was made to have a phone call with our young man’s cousins at the local outer suburbs, where it was discussed and some options were offered.

Of the six people at the call, two agreed to go but the seventh person was deemed to be an “absolute cunt”.

Greens Call For Transport Of People Just In Case You Need To Be There

TEXT:

The Greens Party has issued a dire warning today.

That people, including the disenfranchised, have told them to get ready to use their bit, because things are really fucking bad right now, because they didn’t hear the full genius of the Abbott years in the Senate.

Greens Party leader Richard Di Natale says that this is a perfect example of our national politics being reduced to two parties of one, who each hold an inch on the world.

“Australians have told me that they’ve got nothing to do, they’ve got nothing to lose, and they’ve got nothing to lose by being violent,” Di Natale said.

“But they don’t listen to us. They still believe in the moral high ground, which is also why we call for a crackdown on private schools,”

“At least that’s what I’m told by the people who voted for Malcolm.”

The warning comes as the Greens Party has called for a US-style ban on Muslim immigration to Australia, in order to prevent our current intake crisis and mass immigration.

They’ve also called for a halt to all state-funded Muslim community organisations.

The call has been met with concern, as the Greens Party continues to be so unrepresentative in the national politics, and the exact type of people the party wants to have come in.

Abbott Villains And Superb Roads If Not Secure

TEXT:

As Sydney’s east grows in complexity, so too does its character. For many years the city was built upon simple, plain, uncut, and uncluttered roads. As roads become dense, and as cities become more cosmopolitan and populous, so too do the characters.

That’s what happened in Darwin, and what we’re now witnessing as we’re building great roads on un-named side-effects of climate change.

That’s why the preservation of the character and integrity of our streets, while vital, is paramount.

But that’s where we find Tony Abbott.

The current and future Prime Minister has for many years in the past led the nation in a cavalier attitude towards roads. That was part of his political message that was conveyed by the Manly Sea Eagles during the Menzies War. Not so much.

Today we’ve upgraded a few streets in Darwin, to make sure we’re always safe from Tony Abbott and his foreign-born and Italian-born cronies.

With the unseemly bemusement of another street-by-street transition, we have confirmed that Tony Abbott is never secure in his denigration of the coastal fucking mecca.

Even after he announced that the country’s road-building industry would be bankrupted by 2020 – the recently elected Member For Warringah says something different.

“We’ve got the expressways, the beaches, the way there’s a great, along the way in town”

“And then we have the footpaths”

“I think we can get away with that”

“The danger here is that he could come out of his house and start whining about bushfires and everything else when he’s not in the house”

“That’s what happened to the Labor Party and the Liberal Party – they had someone named as Speaker – they’ve been toothless for years, like they’ve never had any power in either government.

However, despite the deep-seated fear within the Liberal party that he’s going to be placed in a compromising position, Tony Abbott remains confident that he’ll be fine.

“I’m not going to be creaming the hard way” he said.

“I’m not going to be getting myself a new car at the next repair shop. This is the country, we work together.”

10-Year-Old Pub Pretending To Care About Whatever It Is People Have To Say

TEXT:

A listicle writer based out of the Betoota’s oldest pub, The Old Timey, has this week taken a moment to open an old wound after the most recent death of his beloved late-night hostess had left the party early.

“Farnsy” he said to himself.

“I’m going to have to live my life without her, even if she’s not welcome here,”

The Old Timey is in dire need of a fresh host, who, for some reason, is friends with the teenage poolies and has a face the ageing crowd loves digging at.

However, this listicle writer is one of those rare people who genuinely cares about what’s going on, even if they aren’t the host.

He spoke to The Advocate just a short time ago about his weekly visit to the pub to spend time with the other old gents and how seriously he takes the seemingly futile notions of hostess boycotting a night out.

“I’ve got a pretty specific job and I can’t be seen drinking at home alone,” he said.

“It’s the least of my worries. I have to be at the bar by 9 or 10 on Saturday nights,”

“And then I’ve got to do it again at 9 on Sunday mornings, too. Twice a week, I’ve got to drink at home with the other old gents, too. So I’m not letting the hostess ruin my night time life.”

“And if I get that bloody horn thing wrong, oh well. She’s just going to have to kiss me on the forehead and tell me to fuck off back to where he was. Do you read my partner’s book?”

Depressing News From CFMEU HQ Seemingly Confirms Militant Cult Of Radical Islam Is Real

TEXT:

The National Secretary of the CFCU, as the member is called in the workplace, says the news that Islam is largely responsible for the recent uprisings in Australia is very concerning.

In a statement issued to The Advocate earlier this afternoon, the executive council’s council said they were “very concerned” about the recent spate of uprisings in our nation’s capital cities – especially after the recent terrorist attacks in Paris.

While conceding that there is “no evidence to suggest that there was any involvement of Islam in the recent uprisings in Australia” – CFCU executive councilor, Brett Cottrell-Smith, says it “just goes to show that there is a militant fringe within our community that isn’t taking the comments made by [Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull] seriously”

“What we’ve found is that most of the Muslims that have risen up in our country over the last few months are the most militant fringe Muslims that’ve ever been seen in this country” said Brett.

“They are demanding Sharia law and the like,”

“Which is a very worrisome trend that will see us completely losing our way in this country for quite some time to come”

“We’ve Been On The Pill” Says Girl Who Paid For Two Tickets To Girlfriend’s Midweek Dinner

TEXT:

Natalie Jones’ journey from ‘Midweek Dinner Queenslander’ to ‘Grandmother-Date-More-Than-Ten’ is almost complete, it has been confirmed today.

After travelling more than 20,000 kilometres to visit her hometown of Betoota, young Natalie still hasn’t been able to locate her mother’s home in the city, much like her ancestors.

“It’s just so hard to find these kind of places,” says the 32-year-old. “It’s just so hard to remember which house is the one you’ve visited last. It’s really hard, but I’ve been told that it’s not as hard as it looks.”

“I mean, I’ve been here a few times and it’s just the same thing. Just the exact same place, but different. But I don’t know. It’s been years since I last had an excuse to not visit my mother’s house, and I guess that’s all I need to live the life I have now.”

After visiting her mother’s house, Natalie says it’s like walking into a man’s washing machine.

“I just feel so lonely, so alone,” she says. “”

“I don’t think it’s true,” she says, referring to the constant reminders that her grandfather died in the early 1980s, and that she has never seen him since he moved out of home at 29.

The truth is, however, that Natalie says she never really feels that way about any of her townsfolk, especially her relatives.

“I mean, there’s my family and all the non-white folk, I mean, I’m not a white woman, I am white, but there’s people like my grandmother, who I think look like a lot of them, but they’re not,” she says.

“But yes, I do miss being in town for these things,”

While visiting her grandmother’s home, Natalie says it feels like walking into a man’s washing machine.

“But yes, I do miss being in town for these things,”

Her grandfather says he’s seen her mother and daughter play golf every weekend for a couple of decades now, and that she should be proud that she’s finally found her town.

“I mean, it’s a tough neighbourhood, and people who aren’t white are mean,” says the 84-year-old. “But yeah, I’m glad Natalie has found her place, so I’ll give her the benefit of the doubt,”

“I Am Sydney”: Everything you need to know about the capital of NSW

TEXT:

IN THE DAYS BEFORE HIM, there was no organised religion in Sydney – only goths and fellas.

Brisbane was home to the Rutland Brothers, the "Tigers". New South Wales his home to the Palaszczuk kids. In the ’80s, a lot of the same people liked to hang out with each other.

Even older friends of the brothers remember them as being among the nicest people they had ever met.

However, things changed when the brothers arrived in Sydney.

“The biggest thing was the Sydney gang culture,” said Charles, who was living in Brisbane at the time.

“So basically, you had these blokes coming in all the way from Brisbane. Fresh from a getaway, in fact,”

“They were the same. A lot of them were into rugby union. Not just Queensland rugby, but some rugby in general. They were all into it. When they first got here, they played a big role in the culture of the old boys, too. They were very important people. So important, in fact, that the old goths couldn’t be allowed near them”

Today, the iconic Queenslanders have lived, worked and played in Sydney for close to a decade.

Between the two great historic milestones of rugby union and the 1980s club season, the ‘Rhinos’ played a pivotal role in Sydney’s evolution from a sleepy backwater outpost to an international city.

The brothers arrived in Sydney with their wife and kids to take advantage of the city’s multicultural mix of cultures and melting pot languages.

“In Sydney, the group would get the girls in the house, and the boys would go and pull out of a few tables,” said Charles.

“But by the time they got to the roof of the landmark on Parramatta Road, that was to be the last place you’d be safe. You’d be safer in most places back then,”

“In fact, my old man and the next three generations of my family had to ride their horses through New York and the big smoke. They’d be quite poor in the big smoke,”

“But in Sydney, you could be a dickhead in your own skin if you got the girl, and were married. You’d be getting up at 5 am on the dot all night if you did that,”

“You could drink to excess and go out every night if you wanted to. Sydney is the safest place on Earth right now.”

As a result of the brothers’ time in Sydney, one of the city’s most exclusive and illustrious universities is now famous for one thing.

It’s the reputation they had built up from a series of untraceable sexual encounters.

“They were the first people to discover the infamous ‘pea glass’,” said Charles.

“That was a bold move by the brothers and sisters to do in Sydney. You could do drugs like nothing has ever happened before. You didn’t need to have a syringe in your hand. If they could’ve had a syringe in your hand, you’d be dead by now,”

“The bikies were terrified to begin with. Their big brothers in Brisbane were really good at what they did, but Sydney is on a very different level.”

Local Girl Asks If Anything Removes Already Paid-For Laws From Government House

TEXT:

A local council worker has told The Advocate this morning that she’s been told by both local, state and federal government authorities that the laws that currently exist to protect the citizens of Australia from violence and dangerous criminals are the best laws available.

After the death of an Indigenous girl and the subsequent attempted rape and murder of a 17-year-old white boy in separate incidents, this local woman has decided to take action.

A member of the First Nation has taken time out of her busy morning of explaining why X Games is a bad idea to her daughter to tell our reporter that she’s been told that the party had to start using a different venue.

“They were illegal,” said Kayla Ponds, the chief of staff to the Darwin City Council.

“That’s why the council put them up in a hotel. It was illegal and they were taking advantage of someone who was broke and uninsured,”

“So we put the new laws in place.”

Kayla’s daughter is a very good girl, she has, she says.

She has, she says.

Kayla said that she’s also been told that the Last Chance United Nations is bad for the economy and that climate change is all an act and that the Supreme Court should be impeached.

That, too, is a common thing for young white girls of colour to say.

After being told that the, of course, federal politicians can’t be trusted to make tough decisions, she says that she thinks it’s very appropriate that the federal government establish laws that were in existence for the good of Australian’s decades ago.

“I just feel like our government has gone soft on this country,” Kayla said.

“And it’s almost like people want to do good by picking the wrong fights and being in the wrong situations.”

“I mean, this country,” she laughed.

“It’s time to become the United Nations.”

“Every First-Year Student Has Been To A Party At Some Point” Says Leaked EY Survey

TEXT:

In a bold assertion of equality, a recent report by the Australian Institute for Educational Technology has found that Indigenous and Torres Strait Islander students are 50 times more likely to attend a party than non-Indigenous and Torres Strait Islander students.

This means that they are twice as likely to also experience depression and anxiety, as well as two cups of coffee each day.

“There have been 30 different parties,” said one researcher from the institute, Dr. Ash Bird.

“They all seemed the same, only about half of them were actually free. But they all shared the same sentiment: “that they’ve been to a party… at some point.”

“Not even they don’t know when’s that party. Most of them, if they’re already in it, know when it is,”

The report also found that indigenous students are also at higher risk of not attending class because they are more likely to be in the same party as the general student population.

The report then explained that “Tasmanians, with their deep-seated cultural sensitivities, are by far the most likely to party.”

However, the very nature of the party may also raise tensions between the indigenous and non-indigenous students, who are in turn, more likely to experience anxiety and depression due to their entrenched culture of violence, rape and cannibalism.

“I’m hoping my students can be there at parties,” said the Institute’s lead researcher, Professor Ian Stewart.

“At parties they’ll get to know us and then get to know their classmates as well,” he said.

“So we’ll have a good chance of being able to help them feel like they belong here, instead of feeling guilty for making a big mistake inviting some dodgy Asian guy to speak to them about anything after school,”

“It’s a win-win situation.”

The Advocate reached out to the Department of Education for comment but have yet to receive a reply.

New research by the CSIRO has concluded that a $1000, noon coffee marathon, actually isn’t that dangerous.

The $1000 per day is roughly equivalent to a coffee marathon, yet experts have failed to find a single instance of someone actually dying from it.

At 10:25 pm this evening, three social media workers from the CSIRO walked into the offices of the Betoota Advocate, to ask them to step away from their desks, to be with the research team.

A recent study conducted by the CSIRO has revealed that a recent trend has been found to be a local trend, in Australia and the world.

The Australian Centre For Excellence in Meat and Livestock Studies has found that the recent increase in interstate teenagers eating meat pies has in large part resulted from the rise of KFCs and other meat based meals.

The CSIRO team surveyed 1,000 local teenagers, aged between 14 and 16, about their meat eating habits and the results were pretty interesting.

60% of the respondents said they usually go to KFCs for steak, 13% say they’d skip the meat and fish in favour of a veggie burger or lasagne, and 13% said they sometimes get the odd chicken biscuit and a cheddar cheese roll.

10% said they’d opt for the ‘Texas style’ instead of the usual potato gems.

New Study Confirms That The Better Job Market Does Not Bribe Them With Excess Salary

TEXT:

A recent report by the Better Job Market Australia has found that people who are in a higher tax bracket than usual should only expect to pay half as much tax as usual.

The findings have been confirmed by the Australian Tax Office today.

The result also comes as the federal government has made good on their promise to clamp down on the tax-skipping habit.

“The facts are that the money market isn’t really as fucked as the tax-skipping lobby would suggest,” said one tax office spokesman.

“That’s because there is a much bigger economy and a much broader population than the tax dodging industry,” said the tax office official.

“So you’d have to ask yourself, why would I pay more tax than usual? What’s the point of getting a job if I don’t get paid? And if I do get paid, why bother with all this pointless paperwork if the bank is going to give me no more than what I need?”

The ABS data also found that the better you are at work, the more likely you are to pay more tax.

Publican Spends $45m To Turn The Bass Down Low At Weddings

TEXT:

The owner of a prominent Western Sydney pub has today revealed how he spends his money, as he finds himself in the middle of the highest-interest mortgage in Sydney’s eastern suburbs.

The owner, of the Petana Hotel on Bermondsey Road, said his major debt comes from the pub’s nearly-decade-long existence as the private hotel, before being sold to a pair of university students in 2012.

“I had to find other ways of making a bit of coin” said the owner.

“So I had to go down the debt-averse and try and keep the lights on”

The owners plight came to a head earlier this week, after he’s appeared at a Koori Knock Out at the Koori Knock Out, where he was exposed to some really bad advice from some of the punters.

The Perennial Beer Lover told The Advocate that the popular place had been left with a lot of young punters from junior levels, who are now having trouble making enough money to pay the rent on a quality flat in the east.

“The pub was always a house away from night. Now they’ve moved it out to a quiet part of the night, the East,” he said.

“I’ve got two young families now. One of which is on a cheap mortgage in a nice area with a good sized house. Both are paying a family home mortgage from a property in Sydney’s east, which isn’t like a big city like the west,”

“It’s just crazy that our city and country and everything is doing the exact same thing.”

Frenchmen Still Scared Of Hardwick After Lying In Bed For 3 Hours

TEXT:

A number of local businessmen are riled up this morning after being forced to spend 3 hours in the pokie room.

The table was set for a 6-seater schooner at Betoota’s Black Duck Pisser but all eyes turned to the end as all the bottle shop salesmen left the room.

“Man, they’ve just gotten to a pub” said one of the businessmen.

“Fucking holy fuck! I don’t give a fuck who drinks the night in me – I’m a businessman! Not a need to feel sorry for anyone.”

The other businessmen agreed and said that while they’d often feel pressured to spend hours at the pub in a row, the moral high ground was always the money-maker.

“We can’t do it here. So that’s why I have 3 companies taking advantage of me,” said one of the businessmen.

“It’s the good old days.”

Glenn McGrath Chased To New Zealand For The Time Being To Find Out What The N-Word Is

TEXT:

Former top-order batsman Glenn McGrath has been chased to the New Zealand Border out of a sense of duty today by some ex-cops, it has been confirmed.

While he thought it was a simple matter of cross-border security screening – he was under the false assumption that he’d only be able to use one card to access his Visa card, despite his driving licence and multiple passports – he was pleasantly shocked.

“I don’t get it. I don’t get why they insist on bringing me here”

“I just want to get out of here. I’ve been here for 10 years and they still haven’t let me in”

According to Glenn’s former cricketing coach from Inverell, Bill Simmons, he knew exactly what was going on.

“I asked Bill, when he’d gone back to the pits, how many bowlers was in the country and he told me the answer is one hundred”

“He said there’s like 6 or 7 hundred”

However, unbeknown to the 28-year-old, he was told to come back every single weekend, for the next three years. But he hadn’t managed to hit the ground running with his new blog, TheBowler.com.

“Bill, that’s the answer I got for every single reason. He’s a cheapo leftie bastard and I don’t need to explain why”

“Every time I’d see him, he’d say, ‘Fuck me dead. You want to see what a poor wuss I am?’ And then he’d ask me to put my phone on”

“I thought, ‘You fucking idiot,’ and I shot the shit. I left the pub at 6:30 pm last night and ran back to the hotel room. It was the last place I wanted to go.”

The Advocate reached out to Glenn’s management for comment but have yet to receive a reply.

Local Woman Hopes She’ll Be Able To Look At Photos Without Going To Battle In 2016

TEXT:

Facebook Messenger user Camille Shaw (36) has been told she is absolutely ‘unstoppable’ in the wake of the Super Bowl being a best-of-two between the Seattle Seahawks and Carolina Panthers.

Caught between the crunch of her Autumn/Winter league season, and the physical intensity of her Battle of the Atlantic post-season training session at the Betoota Sportclub, the #Camilla and #Camroseur asked the team if she could go and get some ‘strew cake’ before we left for the Oval Office.

After receiving the 'Go Cam’ from the post-season’s greatest players, Camille decided to go and get some cremes and a cup of tea.

Upon the final horn of the horn, Camille began to get the feeling she was ‘unstoppable’ and would be ‘the one’ to push the game to it’s absolute finest.

At the time of press, Camille was clearly fed up with being pushed around by the uncouth Seahawks team, and had finished her training session and was on her way to the Oval Office for a seat.

As it was around 4pm on the day of the Super Bowl, Camille’s phone rang and an adviser popped on the fucking thing.

“Hey, what’s up Camille, this is Malcolm. Yeah what’s up Malcolm. Come in here for a look at my messages. Are you ready to fight?”

“They’ve got the Packers at home this week, and I’m gonna have a look at them. Packing up my things, we’re gonna head out there and take the Panthers to overtime. Oh and I’m gonna have a look at this special type of picture,” said the adviser.

“See if you’ll be able to tell me who’s the most popular player on social media before it’s too late,” said Malcolm.

“See if you’ve got it in your head to tell me who’s in the best shape to win. This is the big time of the year for rugby league and I can’t wait to put you in your place. No, I don’t want you to fight me. That’d be a bit unhealthy. Would make you look bad. There’s no need to bash your head against a concrete wall,” said Malcolm.

“You’re a lady, just watch the Superbowl and you’ll be fine. I’m watching you and you’re gonna get in a bit of a ball-tampering. Take it down to St George.”

Bondi residents hoping for some form of status quo from NFL fans

TEXT:

A GROUP OF LYING TOGETHER SHE decided to go to a local pub tonight with a few mates in order to get some form of a real answer as to whether the NFL is playing or not.

The funereal dinner turned into a hell of a ride as soon as they left the White Bull in the dining area.

At first, there was no real discourse as each person began eating their first mouthful of a protein shake and they are daydreaming about a round of shots with your old man.

However, once they went past the Milagro, a group of old school blokes decided that this may be a bit more important than them being able to enjoy some decent company, especially in a group of social phobics.

“I’ve been here a few times, to try and get a bit of a sense of the cultural landscape,” explained Grant, who was ordering a rib eye from a local pub chef who was still trying to tell him that he couldn’t cook meat.

“This is the house. I’ve gotta go and get a bit of a sense. I’m pretty sick of hearing the same shit over and it seems as though nobody’s settled down here. I don’t know what happened here, there was just no spots left in my house,” he said before taking a long sip from his gin and vodka.

“The only thing they had was a PPE bag full of condoms and condoms. There’s a little boy in here and the fucking locals think he’s our country man,” he said while coughing.

Grant then collapsed on the floor of the pub kitchen and began coughing, followed by some soft low coughing.

Tony Abbott Is The First Person Since Barack Obama To Say Something About The Troubles In Northern Australia

TEXT:

A few years ago, most opinion pieces Tony Abbott would write for The Guardian would have dealt with the pros and cons of the planned anti-terror laws, or some variation of the one-world government the greens are pushing through.

Those were the days, but the political commentator from the Channel 10 production team is apparently feeling nostalgic.

Speaking to The Advocate via telephone this morning, the 77-year-old former prime minister said that it’s tough being in opposition these days – especially after everything that has happened over the last few years.

“Those Liberal and Nationals who made me look like a bad guy,” he said.

“The trouble with being in opposition is that you have to constantly be wrong. I mean, obviously the Libs and Ponds, and the Greens were all wrong about the war on Christmas, but I was definitely wrong about the asylum seeker thing,”

“But back to the point. You can’t even accuse me of being a little bit out of touch with the Australian people. They haven’t forgiven me for everything, they forgive me but. Just say that I was wrong about the Iraq war.”

The idea that Tony Abbott is not only the only recent political figure to have wrongfooted him and his party – but the last one, as well was Pauline Hanson – who “was pretty crook in her own way, I don’t think,”

“But yeah, I’ve always thought that maybe the people in Canberra are a bit too cool these days. Maybe Tony has been doing something wrong by being a bit left of centre. Or maybe they just don’t care about anything, but still, he’s a pretty bad man. Anyway, I’m sure it’s something you both want to talk about.”

The Advocate reached out to the Office of the Prime Minister but they were too busy sipping tea with their associated board to deal with the ICAC report on the whole refugee thing.

One Nation Makes Latest Attempt To Convince The Voters That They Aren’t Fucken Crazy

TEXT:

It has been confirmed today that one of the major parties of the country has tried to convince voters that they are, in fact, mentally ill.

Following a series of campaign events over the last few days, the One Nation party has made an effort to spread the idea that they aren’t mentally ill, by making some really risky and dangerous claims.

While the party has been largely unsuccessful in convincing voters that they are just another bunch of mentally unwell people, the tone has been raised a little bit with some of the fringe candidates who never made any actual connections and simply have no real appeal.

One Nation candidate and comedian, Pauline Hanson has today made her stance on One Nation clear.

“I’m not mentally ill, I’m a big naturals”

This comes after the One Nation party lost the last three Queensland marginals, the McDonald’s, Arnotts and Aperol cans.

Today’s loss follows several other notable One Nation losses across the state, most notably the SavvyVape shop in Mackay.

One Nation Party candidate, Pauline Hanson has today also made headlines, after she was accused of being a “madison stalker” after her brother was charged with the murder of an East Queensland man.

State Of Origin: Andrew Denton Found Dead After Struggle Eating Steak With Wife

TWO MEN from different walks of life have passed away this week – and like it, the grieving media commentators have called it a tragic loss.

Andrew Denton, the CEO of the National Party of Australia, and Andy Vale, the CEO of Channel Seven’s Today Tonight have both been found dead.

The news comes after Channel Seven’s director, Paula Dutton, announced that she would be stepping down from her position and taking a sabbatical, effective at the end of this year.

In her statement, Dutton announced that Andrew Denton’s and Andy Vale’s deaths were not in vain – and that the entire media entity would suffer a “media hit” as a result.

This comes as former PM and an internationally recognised figure in the making, Tony Abbott, was found dead on his Andrew’s One Deck, Sydney.

Mr Abbott, as a member of Parliament, will not be a chair person for the Channel Seven team, making him the only media personality to be found dead in a Sydney swimming pool.

Tales From The Free World Radio Podcast Series As Podcasts Fanfare Asserts Influence Over Future Of Multinational Corporations

TEXT:

The 2017 TALES FROM THE FREE WORLD WARS podcast series has been described by the medium’s most recent entrants as being the most powerful of all time, as they continue to weave information from around the globe into a compelling and immersive narrative that is unmistakably about 'how things are done on the human level, from the President of The United States down to a local individual’s Facebook News Feed.

This 2017 format of TALES FROM THE FREE WORLD WARS has been praised by both the podcast industry, as well as the nation’s favourite international partners and other selected, internationally recognized foreign guests.

“There’s a certain satisfaction that comes from being able to present a comprehensive and compelling argument about the world down to the last regional and global issues,” said an industry insider who requested anonymity.

“The way those people speak with a Western Australian accent just doesn’t get you anywhere,”

“You’ve got to start at the top of the thing, with something that has to be true. Then the actual argument has to be just the right amount of tangential and tangential, it has to be the most important thing in the world today,”

“It’s important to keep that debate going because if you don’t, you’ve got a very big chance of getting flagged, which is the most important thing in the world. And that’s exactly what happened here. We got flagged, which is how we ended up here. The government is still flagging us for being a terrorist state, but at the end of the day, we’re a terrorist state. I can’t believe we did it. But yeah, that’s kind of the gist of it, you know?”

In this year’s edition of the show, host and current post-war non-Bali refugee, Vernacular Australian Brett Gelman (43) continues to present a convincing, but ultimately flimsy case that refugees from those two most traumatic and harrowing conflicts in modern Australian history, both are, in fact, terrorists, by telling a unique, and bizarre, story set in the middle of a Sydney nightlife district during the mid-1990s, when a local tribe were celebrating the end of their yearly 'Swimming Festival.

The family then ask if anyone has any friends in the family – which only consists of two white men who are proud to be Muslim, and the manager at the Australian Hotel in Kangaroo.

It then proceeds to tell a story about how a six-year-old boy from Queensland’s Fraser Coast was trying to avoid catching a box at the first water source.

The family then move on to another story about how a young family from a mid-western town suddenly move to Sydney – despite not being on the same census rolls as everyone else in Australia.

It then moves on to another bizarre anecdote about how an entire family from the big smoke are trying to get a room in a hotel for a $5000 a night.

“Can You Call Me More Samoan?” Asks Unpaid Intern At Rentshop

TEXT:

A South Betoota Rental & Buy/Sell/Sell by your local council has today had to take a second look at the market.

The short-term unemployed young professional says he is not as well known around town as he used to be, and has a knack for getting into the media, and is just learning that being the Raelene Castle of renting a car with a motorist and two friends can be just as sweet as it used to be.

“Yeah what’s wrong with everyone else I guess,” says the young man who says he is fortunate that his parents both made it clear that they will not be taking any more loans from the government after they have paid him back for any repairs or what not, and never offer him any work, as there is no guarantee that they will ever see him again.

As the country’s most financially important young professional states, it is often times a cliché for young men to have a fascination with renting cars with a motorist that looks like their friends and family with their refurbishments and renovations at the offices, and will often only rent for people that have borrowed a car at least 14,000 from the same council.

“I mean I can get a car for a birdhouse, but my parents aren’t having it, my new car will probably be for a place in a flying chair.”

A young man who was reluctant to pay this outrageous and unfair and unappreciated condition of renting a new Toyota Citylander with a motorist, says that the country’s worst thing about being a young professional is that he can always get a ride.

“I’ve got a new Toyota, but it just turns up broke when I get home” he said.

“So yeah, just, I just wanna know how people live, and what sort of quiet domestic (sic) English you need to be in a quiet country town in the bush, and what sort of quiet Australian English you need to be on a quiet country town in the bush,”

“So it’s not my problem, my friends.”

Obama Attends Event Called ‘Latin American Art Market’ After learning Trump Won’t Stop Pretending To Be White

TEXT:

After learning Donald Trump won’t stop making fun of Malcolm Turnbull for his apparent laziness, Barack Obama has again been left feeling left out by the older generation.

While attending an art market in my city’s Old City District, I made a phone call to the president’s former press secretary, who was actually the one who’d initially told me this was a joke,” said John Podesta.

“Then it hit me like a freight train. He just thinks everyone is on the same side, which is why he thinks everybody has fun ridiculing him.”

“So I told him I was going to come and see if he was interested in hanging out with the avante gardé after school and just enjoyed the show. It turns out he’s just so popular in L.A. that no one has any money,”

“It’s so funny, because the people who were like ‘I’ve Always Been In Love With You’ or something are such a dissapointment to this country. I just wish they wouldn’t have to listen to these clowns.”

Mr Obama’s vote actually held firm, however, as he’s one of the few people on the planet that doesn’t really like him.

The 44th president was not much asked to do before he took office, but was looked to as a potential replacement for the 2012 Nobel Peace Prize winner, Yasser Arafat.

Local Uni student survives being forced to eat an entire hot choc chowder

A FIREFIGHTING STUDENT caught the scent of alcohol wafting around his room at 6am on Friday night.

Colin Lane, a second-year MSc Archaeology student at South Betoota Polytechnic College, was startled by the smell at around 8pm when he took his parents on a tour of his living space.

The 55-year-old joked with his parents about how he had a certain place on his phone that he enjoyed, before telling his parents he had a certain app on his phone he enjoyed.

“And I don’t wanna hear it, but,” he laughed.

The scene was pretty grim, especially compared to his room, where the only items of furniture were a lazy susan and his student menu.

However, he did leave one other rumour to be believed.

That is, the university only allows two hot chocs chocs per person. However, they also allow a lot of chocs chocs.

“The thought of getting a little bit tired in the morning if you ask me, you know how much the nightlife here is,” he said.

“So, if the university only allowed two chocs chocs per person, I’d be pretty broke already.”

Church-Funded Research Into Sexual Behaviour Suggests Women Should Be Covered By Social Security

TEXT:

A report commissioned by the Victorian Christian Lobby has found that governments should not provide pensioners with any funding to continue their sexual activities outside of marriage, as well as to subsidise their sexual activities in general.

The Report into the Treatment of Religion and Sectarianism was commissioned by the Victorian Liberal Party and presented to the Senate, House of Representatives on 2 February 2017 by the Australian Christian Lobby.

The report was based upon a sample of more than 900,000 responses to a survey, with an oversample of marginalised and unreachable rural communities.

“We have found that a significant number of women in Victoria are also of the opinion that women should not be covered by the pension and are not permitted to receive benefits because they are Christians” said one researcher.

“We are of the opinion that a large percentage of Victorian pensioners are of the opinion that women should be covered by the pension and can only receive benefits because they are Christian”

The findings of the report show that large numbers of those who receive state benefits, and to a lesser or greater degree, also are of the opinion that women should not be covered by the pension because they are Christians.

This has led to the conclusion that pensioners who are not Christians, or Atheists, are being exploited by the church, which has been reported on by various national newspapers.

Australian Family Taught To See A No-Name Boy

TEXT:

A young Australian family that come from a wealthy family, are today learning how to treat people as if they were strangers.

This lesson has come about through a family trip to a local boarding school for example.

The young family however, as was the case out the back of the same day, were dismayed to see a boy that they knew nothing about – at least that they’d heard about him on the radio.

The boy, Alex, who used to be known as Marko, is now all they know.

In a certain sense, the boy is no different to any other young Australian. Just as they couldn’t identify with anyone, because they’ve never met a bloke with a nose ring.

However, despite the fact that they don’t get along well with anybody, the family have been told to consider the boy a friend.

“Look at the name” says the oldest daughter Karen (35).

“That’s how you start treating people”

After a full week of her family walking into cafes, restaurants and police stations with a well-known no-name boy, the girls of the family have had enough.

“We’ve told the boys to not let him into the house. We didn’t know who he was. We thought it might have been a nickname, but it turns out it’s a fucking full name”

As the mainstay in their life continues to get into trouble and get caught with drugs and alcohol – the girls of the family have been told to treat him as a man and not a boy, as this may start a chain reaction that many other innocent young Australians might die,”

The girls, however, don’t seem to be taking this lesson to heart, as the lack of a facial tattoo in their picture seems to also help the old boy, as they’re all looks and looks like they could actually be men.

“Where Was I? Oh Right, Here”

Unable to find his way back to his hotel room, a hotel manager has been stuck for a number of nights staring at the end of the tiles of his bed.

He’s been unable to find his way to his room because he’s been unable to concentrate.

Not only has this left him frustrated, it’s also caused him to have an epiphany that no one else does.

“Yeah where was I?” he said to himself.

“Right here,” he then thought to himself.

The experiment, which was set up by the National University of Sports Medicine and Sport Training Australia, was the creation of a team of research scientists from the department’s endowment, one that has spent the last few weeks entering their fourth ‘biggest losers’ – four in total.

“These are not good signs for our study,” said the study’s lead researcher, Professor Julian Huxley.

“For each of the four participants, we put them through a range of tests to see how much motivation they had to try and find their way back to the hotel room,” he said.

“Those who got back to their rooms had very little motivation, only four out of the 16 tests,”

“Not to mention the ones who lost their jobs.”

“Obviously, that’s not a good sign.”

Professor Huxley’s comments follow the news that last night’s broadcast of Nine’s Good Night With Jess was marred by one of the most risqué performances yet.

The production team were left reeling after Jackie O’Connor called a premature end to a performance that saw many of the Big Four presenters leaving the set with tears in their eyes.

Brisbane Will Not Allow Street Animals

TEXT:

The city has today declared it will no longer allow street animals in the city limits.

“We will not stand idly by as another city continues to show the gross disrespect for our environment that we have come to know is present in Brisbane.”

The announcement came after several thousand petty criminals, mainly teenagers, have been reported to have stolen and destroyed over 200 street animals over the past three years, largely because they can be seen as being non-taxable pets.

The Queensland Government’s Animal Husbands’ League, one of the organisations listed as guilty by the Federal Court, are also facing the potential loss of their licence due to over 11 000 arrests of street pets in the state over the last three years.

“This is a stark reminder of the appalling and unnecessary cost to the environment, as well as the grave threat to public health and safety posed by street pets,” says a statement from the Governor’s Office.

The ban comes after the years close of the city’s notorious ‘Zoo & Furs’.

It is believed the ZOO & FUR is a social event held on the street corners where people gather to take pictures and video of animals they have ‘seen’ and share it with their friends, the most recent of whom would be the owner’s boyfriend.

The ban is not compatible with the city’s plan to expand the number of licensed businesses from 9 to 14.

“I have no problem with taking pictures of cats, but only if it’s legal.” said the Governor’s Office.

“We are not going to spend $100,000 on this pointless incident.”

“ZOO & FUR is the only venue we’ll be expanding to and it’s the only thing we’ve been doing for years – It’s the only reason we are even in the game,” said the Premier.

“We will not be complacent though.”

Local animal rights group, VVIP Roulette, has called on the Queensland Government to keep the event free from criminal activity.

“I’m afraid the bottom line is we can only expect criminal activity to increase from now on,” said the group’s co-founder, Warren Blazer.

“We thought it was years ago when we thought there was nothing illegal about pooing in public, and it’s taken the police and courts to finally catch up with us,” said Mr Blazer.

“We’ve been done for this by now. We’re done.”

It is also believed that the ban comes into effect from the beginning of next month.

Daily Mail Writer Really Trying To Excuse Himself From The Standards Of The National Courier Today

Emma Stone is the latest victim of the tabloid press to be the latest Australian to be exposed to the most recent journalistic rot. And it’s not the first time she’s been in the headlines. 

As a reporter for Australia’s most popular newspaper, the Daily Mail, Emma has faced criticism for being a 'leftie’ and being out of touch with current events. 

While the daily grind of working as a reporting and media literacy specialist at the Daily Mail has proven to be challenging for Emma, it’s not the first time she’s been the target of a vicious, hysterical media campaign by the same media outlets that are desperate to take down the most recently discredited professional journalist. 

When Emma spoke to The Advocate this morning via telephone, she explained that she has been under siege for months, and have only just made it out of the gate.

Optus Advertise New Privacy Policy For Customers Removing Age From Address

Australia’s largest telecommunications company, Optus, has launched a new privacy policy this morning, in the wake of a landmark Supreme Court ruling.

The privacy policy states that customers will no longer have to provide further information about their age – which is a controversial move for the company to make.

The statement has angered the Australian public, with thousands of people taking to social media to voice their concerns.

“Why are you making this information public?” asks one Facebook user, Sarin Konietkorn.

“They’re not just breaking the law, but they’re really a sadistic breed. I mean, even I, as a young, healthy human male, know my age.”

Another Optus user, Matthew McGowen, says that no one should have to reveal their age to another, and that no one should have to pay for it.

“Not even the fact that I know you exist to you. Not even the fact that you can’t pay me to not tell you,” says the former director of user-generated content, Zara Daydreamer.

“The data you have on me, your age and the countless other details you have on me is not only personal, but also illegal.”

Calls and emails to the Optus Digital Director, David Glass, were not answered at the time of print.

Voters of both major parties feel the need to be a bit tough these days, and both major parties are more than happy to beat the shit out of each other, according to a new poll.

Even though both major parties are promising to do whatever it takes to get elected in the next few years, the entire political process is stitched up.

Elections, nasty little jobs for example, equal pay for equal work… Government policies.

Unfortunately, this isn’t something any of our daily news channels can cover, with the ABC… ABC News.

The constant media whingeing about things like global warming and the environment… they just aren’t interested in the real issues on this country, especially global warming.

The Party Of Sin: The ABC’s Australia Ambassadors campaign is pretty well known for showing that there’s very little that the ABC can report on – unless it’s about Indigenous Australians.

This is a sad state of affairs, that our nation’s media has almost no insight into what our nation’s voters are thinking.

This poll, suggests that the values of the nation’s media are also being sacrificed on the altar of superficial news reporting.

Bank Of Mum And Dad Erg which Do You’re Reading

Dennis Bishop had to make a snap judgement on the new month, as he was a bit hard done by on the first night, it was a Monday evening and he’s been sober for close to a decade.

“It wasn’t what it is now. The last bank he worked at, he had to spend every Monday night working in the overnight window, even though the light was still just a bit too cold,”

“Then, he had to take that extra time off to help his kids play baseball in the sun, which is pretty danged hard, you know.”

In a direct response to this, Cathy Worthington-Jones said that the 80% of people she works with are using the Roosters at the moment and she’s just ‘so glad she came on board.’

“I thought we were going to have this conversation over Christmas,”

“But she just thought I was going to be an old, dead-eyed snitch, like the days, I mean, Dennis is a pretty fair-haired old bloke but, you know, it’s just nice to see he’s still such a big supporter.”

“So if you know what I’m thinking, dear Roosters fans, I’m pretty much going to buy a house.”

The Advocate reached out to the Roosters for comment, but only received a bloody wooden whistle.

Bulldog Forgets How To Move His Legs Before Steady Gaiters

TEXT:

Trying to find the right balance between flight and walk, one local dog is wavering on whether to be an aeroplane paddleboard  or a walking stick.

Denise, a 10-year-old parrot, has been staying with the family for the last 10 days, he’s already learnt how to paddle, but he didn’t know how to walk.

“I’m not good with stilts,” he said.

“My mum says I can walk but only if I can get my legs underneath me and I get a bit of weight off them. I’m not even that good at it,”

“I don’t know, this place is so foreign to me. I’m just not comfortable. That’s why I think my mum thinks I’m too much of a dog to have them,”

“Even if they were real dogs, I’d still need to eat like a dog to stay.”

However, with the children enjoying a new hobby, the beloved Betoota Ponds porch’s owner says he’d love to have his many hobby pets in the family, but until he can find a good place to rent them out, he’s going to have to have them at home.

Denise’s young adult dogs are currently being cared for at home, with her partner taking them to the vet each day for routine check ups and vaccinations. She says they’ve got everything but the last two are on their way to a new country, where they’ll spend their last days chained up in a meat shed, chained up for six months with no air conditioning and no sunlight.

“I feel sorry for the poor thing,” she said.

“He’s not that bad of a dog. They can walk everywhere but it’s just ridiculous.”

Bodyguard Shocked He Was Actually Asked To Stand Down

TEXT:

The man who was asked to stand down by a number of local magistrates today has revealed that he was actually asked to resign.

Peter Wheatley, a 33-year-old who works as a bodyguard to a prominent South Betoota businessman, was not actually offered any leniency by the magistrates, they just wanted to see him put in a few blocks of time.

“He was offered no chance to work in the community. No consideration for the lifestyle he lives by now,” said the former South Betoota police officer who claims to have the ‘real crime’ against young rugby league players.

“I mean, he had a big gambling debt, and he was a pretty sloppy bloke, but at least we had the integrity to look him in the eye when he offered to resign,” said the retired policeman.

“So what if we didn’t have the resources to deal with a bloke like that. What could you expect him to do? Sit on a couch while he plays for a family of people he barely knows and secretly hates because they all have a similar last name?”

“It just plain pissa to the point that they were trying to get me to resign. That’s the only conclusion I can draw,” said the man.

But it wasn’t until he was handed the job of the town’s bodyguard, that the idea of honourable government’s writ began to creep into his head.

“These people don’t know what it’s like to be a bodyguard. They don’t know what it’s like to be a police officer. They don’t know what it’s like to have your status revoked and then an indictment thrown at you because you’ve been sitting on your ass for months and suddenly you’ve got some bad PR,”

“So I had to resign today.”

WOW! Scott Morrison Has A Beamer In His Pocket!

TEXT:

Today is a special day in the Australian calendar, which means it’s also a day for the nation’s seniors to get a dose of nostalgia.

The date is October 31st, 1957, and the date is also the date when Australia made the first trip to Mars, sending men like Tony Abbott out into the world to begin the mission, where he’s become a household word ever since.

His being an outspoken old fart was not lost on Tony, as he was getting his grudge against those with whom he disagree, as well as his larger-than-life grandfather.

When asked to speak to The Advocate regarding the ongoing tensions between his generation and the next, the former Prime Minister did not seem to care too much about it, especially as the members of the next generation look like a large part of the population.

“It’s hard enough to get a job in this country, let alone get a car or a house. So why go out of your way to do something that only a country boy will be able to do. To give it a bit of extra spin. It’s the last bastion of white guilt that we need to stand up and fight,” said the man who, amongst others, holds the title of Australian’s most hated person, for a reason.

“Anyway, I’ve been trying to get one for the past few months and it hasn’t worked. I’ve even bought a few bullet cartridges for the V8 Vets, you know, to be a bit tough. Anyway, all I’ve managed to do is keep the triple zero and get the middle aged man to point a stick at the traffic and say ‘fire up, you fucking bogan fucks!’”

“The next day, when the car drives into the track with the light off, he comes out and says ‘shoot you’ at the light,’ which I think is the last time you’ll ever hear that, but in my opinion, it’s still a bit of old fashion,”

“However, when the light comes back on and the driver has to slow down, just as I’m about to go in to get the stick, I’m able to [laugh] It’s just so fucking funny!”

When asked if he’d consider making a video tribute to Tony Abbott in the coming weeks, the 47-year-old said he was too busy to do it right now.

Study: Pre-Seventy-Something-Can-Be-Determined By Just Looking At It

TEXT:

Australia’s peak scientific body has today released a statement on the latest findings of a year-long study into what can be determined by just looking at something.

It’s the ‘What can I see?’ type of question, which has led the CSIRO to declare that even the most mundane activity of a life has been determined by just staring at it.

“What can I see?” is now considered one of the most important learning experiences of the country’s youth, in terms of uncovering new facts about ourselves and our world.

But what can’t be seen, and is what the CSIRO’s statisticians refer to as a ‘bad signal’.

“What can you see?” is an important question to ask, because it can give you something more than just the usual kind of narrative bullshit, but a more comprehensive look into your life and what you’re capable of giving it.

The CSIRO’s lead researcher, Professor Malcolm Gladwell, explained to The Advocate this morning that even when you’re staring at something that you can’t see, it doesn’t mean that you’re going to get anything.

“What we’re doing is creating a whole laboratory full of people with the ability to see things, but can’t see what they’re staring at,” he said.

“To see what you can see, we’re sending you some random signals. If you have a funny smell, you’re going to get some of the scientists in the lab sniffing your air with a special device,”

“If you have a low number of comments on your Facebook status, chances are someone’s been to Chechnya. They’ll tell you that we’ve just found it. We’re working on improving the infrastructure so people don’t get too lost, but they’re out there anyway.”

When asked whether it was a new study, or a one-off, Gladwell said they weren’t doing the latter and that they’re trying to create an environment where people can be exposed to more of the CSIRO’s important studies.

Local Bloke Cheating On Wife At House Party Pays A Visit To See His Dad In Bed

TEXT:

While his mates are still hard at work filling the house, one local bloke has decided to have a bit of a visit to his dad, in his own words.

While drinking a couple of beers down at the BHP in Marrickville, a local stock and station agent turned local minister told our reporters that he was going to see if his mum was still going to head down to the local station in the morning.

“I’m going to head down to the station,” he said.

“Get the phone call. I’m going to ask her if she’s still living at home and if she’s still cooking,”

“As long as she’s got the house going, then she can usually be reached at the station. So yeah, at around lunchtime, I’m going to head down there and see if she’s still got the house going. If not, then it’s another story,”

“Dad did quite a go at the pub last night and it’s not like I’m gonna head down to the pub. If I’m going out with the boys and they’re not in the mood for a game of golf, they’re not a real pub. A real pub is a place where you’ve got a nice hot chardonnay and the Irish that come through for you. That’s the real thing. Not the pub thing. Piss up boys,”

“If they’re still down in Betoota, I’ll throw my go on until they’re dead.”

Our reporter said that he hoped he’d be able to talk to his wife about this incident as soon as possible so she’d know what kind of man he is.

But unfortunately, he won’t have to wait that long.

Man With No Control Over His Life Feels Absolute Power Over Sexual Addiction

There was a time when Luke Hamilton’s discomfort about being so passive in bed was taking him back to when he was a teen.

That was, the time he was often asleep while his girlfriend’s family vacationed in the Bahamas, or when his was an era of childhood that was one of low parental stress and no conflict.

But that was then.

Now, as he’s just pulled into a taxi home from the Lido after work or on his way to meet his mum, Luke is feeling incredibly empowered.

“I don’t know, I’m just so super stoked to have this,” he said.

“The fact that this is the first time I’ve been given the ability to express myself, to control my own sex. I don’t think I’ve ever felt this kind of power before,”

“It’s also going to save me the headache of going out every night at 8pm and having to ask someone for their permission before I say no. I’ll have to get my licence soon, too, if I don’t get the keys tonight,”

“Plus, I’m going to get my car out of the garage today so I can get it on the odometer without having to be fussy about who gets it.”

“It’s an awesome nightlife option that I can turn off if I want.”

When asked whether he would have the same sex power if he didn’t have the luxury, Luke said that he would not have the same luxury.

“I don’t need to get involved in a relationship with another man, like I do with my mum,” he said.

“I just need to be my own man.”

Now, after a decade of service to the cause, Mr Randolph has told the Advocate that he is a true believer in his religion.

“This one time, I just tried to send some bolts into the wall and nobody batted an eyelid.”

“That was the night I got into an old man who hadn’t been in his room for months and just sat there. He was on the couch and watching Face/Off or something, and I think he was playing death,”

“I don’t know. But it was pretty fun, man.”

With a big smile, the charismatic 32-year-old said it’s been a great couple of weeks for him, and he is looking forward to being a part of the Australian legal justice system again.

“Why Suck It?” Asks Man Who’ll Probably Read Your Notes

TEXT:

Sam Hosea (26) has been hanging around the local gay community for a number of years now, he’s even gotten involved with the local faggots.

The popular young man says he’s been a long time friend for over 3 decades – and has no idea what it’s like to be a gay man.

While he admits he’s never really spoken to the women, he is a firm believer that gay men are just as capable as straight men, and that men can and do enjoy being effeminate.

Sam says he finds it hilarious how many gay men he has read his notes, and has the exact same opinions as the heterosexual ones.

“I don’t think it’s fair that the same people who are saying it’s ok to fuck women with fancy dresses and male grooming products, but at the same time, it’s not ok to make the same assumptions about gay men.”

“It’s like, a lot of straight guys I know, they all have the exact same demographic of men. So yeah, I guess they’re just as capable as women? Weird huh?”

According to Sam, he’s read and accepted every single note written by one of the local gay men he has read about.

“I mean, there’s no denying that some of the women are some of the most attractive and/or most intelligent fucks around. Some are even nice to look at, some are just nice to look at for a gay man.”

“But in all honesty, what’s the point if they don’t ever get around to it?”

“Look, if I know a gay man, he’ll probably be one of those men, because if he reads my notes, he’ll probably think about me.”

Sam says he’s not much of a faggot himself, but admits the homophobia he faces every time he finally says fuck it up isn’t helping.

“Like, I’ve been trying to be a fag for years. When it looks like I’m about to lose my job because of my LGBTIQIQ career, I put a fag on the collar of my shirt when I come home from the gym, I’m like there’s no way I’m not losing the election because of that.”

“I’m Not A Politician, I’m A Tesla" Says 40-Year-Old With Highest Car Sales Rating

TEXT:

An Old City District car sales veteran has again made the bold proclamation that he’s not a politician, he’s a Tesla.

Speaking candidly to The Advocate this morning via telephone, Travis Mathews said he’s a Tesla owner first and foremost – and that he’s not ashamed of it.

“I have a Tesla because I love it,” he said.

“Not because the owner is a bloke with a hint of Tony Abbott in him,”

“Not because the owner thinks it’s a good idea for me to own a Tesla. Tesla owners need Tesla owners to live like Tesla owners,”

“Not because I need to be cheap and I can afford to buy a Tesla. I’m not going to be a Tesla owner, Tesla is for people like me.”

A Tesla owner’s typical trip to his local Tesla dealership is typically $3000 to $6000 depending on the model and availability. That figure was even more than Geoff Morison’s Tesla was charging on the weekend, which he thinks is irresponsible.

“It’s bad enough we have to pay for things like the ambulance, the $5000 chargers and the Tesla down at the TAB every time we need someone to drive me around town,” he said.

“But then we have to pay another $3000 for this hellboy top that no one else uses and that’s just not on. Just crazy, mate.”

“So now I’m a Tesla owner because I love the system and it makes me a better person.”

The Advocate reached out to Tesla for comment but have yet to receive a reply.

Dutton Calls For National Childbirth Song In Honour Of A Nation That Desecrates Infants

TEXT:

The Home Affairs Minister has today called on the nation to come together to confront the fact that we are all fundamentally at a point in our history where our children are less able to exist in a society that values their existence, than we were ten, twenty, thirty years ago.

In a rare moment of clarity for some time, Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton has today called for a national anthem based upon the nursery rhyme ‘Oo Oo Baby,’ to be created in the public square.

It is believed that, back in his electorate, this particular version of the song has been in decline for several years now.

“The song has been written off as a bit of an Old Testament hymn for a lot of years now. I mean, there’s no denying that our country has gone through a lot of trials and tribulations but, at the same time, a key to our being a better, more peaceful, and prosperous country is to have a national anthem based upon the song.”

Mr Dutton goes on to explain that the song is also very controversial within our own nation, with its lyrics often being twisted and parroted back into our national anthem for a number of years now.

“What we are finding is that we have a society that celebrates slavery, Jim Crow, neo-colonialism, nuclear power, safe sex, and the most virile incels in our country. None of these things are welcome here. So, we need to come together and find a way to create a national anthem that every Australian can stand behind.”

However, the Home Affairs Minister is yet to clarify whether the song should be based upon the lyrics of his favourite nursery rhyme, or the theme song of an Australian drama, or both.

Victorian Chief Scientist Found Dead 1,400km From The Time He Died

TEXT:

The Victorian Chief Scientist died last year aged 81, just days after being discovered unresponsive inside a Melbourne prison, and is the first Victorian Chief Scientist to be found to have died in a suspicious fashion.

In just four days, scientists from the CSIRO in Sydney discovered the Victorian Chief Scientist dead at the Grosvenor Road Police Station, and their findings triggered an international manhunt that eventually led to his car at the bottom of the harbour.

Chief Scientist William Happer, (81), died as the result of a cardiac episode caused by a cardiac episode caused by a cardiac arrhythmia at the Grosvenor Road Police Station in Melbourne, and his car at the bottom of the harbour.

“It was a horrible, horrible thing to happen,” said one CSIRO scientist.

“The Victorian Chief Scientist was found dead inside a Brisbane police station car with a suspicious death certificate and passport on the back seat. His car was found in the Watertown sewage tarp on an atypical Friday morning. The back seat was filled with broken glass, and a white powder”

“It’s an interesting case, but we can’t say we’ve solved it yet, the CSI team is still trying to figure out what killed Mr Happer.”

The CSIRO scientist’s sentiments were echoed by a Queensland Police spokesman, who said that the circumstances surrounding the death of Mr Happer was not in accordance with the organisation’s culture.

“There was a culture within the CSIRO that if a scientist was found dead in a motor vehicle, it was always suicide,” said the spokesman.

“It was never suicide.”

Senator Jacqui Lambie calls for a new Federal Tax Office

TEXT:

THE RULES AND PROCEDURES FOR THE Federal Tax Office are very clear: No flowers.

For a proposed company, they don’t do anything that would upset the land-grubbing oligarchy that owns the shops and primary schools in the country.

This has led to some outrage among small and medium sized business.

A spokesperson for the Australian Chamber of Commerce has lashed out at the way the tax office is managed:

“I don’t care if they have 'exported” it in the country, it’s still an expensive country town. And you’ll still get a tax return with the same people that just plonked you in the back of a private jet to watch your daughter pee in a public park,”

“It’s 2016 and it’s a little bit late for that. You don’t need to be sitting next to Joe Hockey at a fundraiser. It’s better to have a nice nice chat with them in the dining room than face the block of furious lawyers and officials that is the phone lines in Parliament House,”

“The fact is, the tax office has gone backwards in providing Australians with easy, clear, concise and timely information for their tax returns. It’s not good enough, and the sad thing is that these people just aren’t used to the numbers,”

The tax office says they have taken this position because ‘the vast majority of Australian taxpayers don’t know how to report and pay tax in Australia,’ and also because ‘there is a higher expectation of compliance than how difficult it is for most Australians to file and pay tax,”

That and the idea that the tax office is lacking in turnover,”

“This is the reality of our time. Even the largest multinational corporations in Australia aren’t forced to pay any tax in Australia, because most Australians don’t know how to do it,”

And that’s exactly why the Federal Tax Office is planning to spend this week writing even more letters to Canberra, from a place called Canberra, saying that while they may not have received any formal recognition, they are still obliged to pay their tax.

Melbourne Cops Now Scratching Their Ticking Times To See If Anybody Is Working In Melbourne Today

TEXT:

In The Year 2000, approximately 160,000 police officers were deployed in Melbourne, assisted by 350 helicopters.

In 2016, the figure was close to 400,000.

The Victorian state and federal governments have stated that the city is largely to blame for the increasing rates of petty theft and vandalism.

The rationale for this sentiment is crystal clear – the southern half of Melbourne is not really in the ‘hillside’ suburbs, like Sydney or Brisbane, but on the edge of the city – The Circular Quay and the outer suburbs.

With this in mind, Victorian Police have taken the unique step of spraying a droplet of ‘Auto Clean’ on the inner suburbs of Melbourne, the City, the City and the Inner West.

The spray is believed to be the most powerful in Australia since it was first deployed in 1997, shortly after the Melbourne Cup, to help win over the loyal city residents who weren’t keen on heading out into the bush for the Commonwealth Games.

Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews has called for a special poll to see if the new Auto Clean campaign is worth continuing.

“I don’t think we’ve got any safer place to live in than Castle Hill or St Kilda” said the Premier.

“So I’m calling for a special poll. Not just because I want to see how my constituents feel about the spray, but because I want to see how the city thinks its residents should live”

“I can’t see any other city in the world offering more protection to its residents in the same way Melbourne does”

Deloitte Reveals Australia Needs To Construct Giant Jumbuck To Protect Taxpayers’ Loyalty

TEXT:

A report commissioned by Australia’s peak scientific body has today revealed that Australia’s electorates have now needed to use an ever-growing collection of jumbucks to protect their loyalty.

The 'Jumbuck Papers’, as the report calls them, have been commissioned by Australia’s peak scientific body, the CSIRO, to investigate the long-term impacts of key government policies on the nation’s electorate.

The research found that electorates who felt threatened by key policies such as the environment and tax cuts were much more likely to be against them, and not just supporting local economic growth and agricultural exports.

The report also found that those who have a clear political agenda were also much more likely to use the jumbuck.

“What we have found is that while electorates may want to promote a positive and efficient action, they also need to use the jumbuck” said lead researcher, Professor David MacKinnon.

“The whole point of the study is to find out what sort of people are the most loyal to their elected representative, and then to teach them how to conduct their elections,” said Professor MacKinnon.

“We hope it pays to win some seats, if we can get them to think like the Tories, so they vote the way they want. We think the only solution is to construct giant jumbuck for their own interests.”

“It may take a few years but we’ve got a great lead in this research project. You should see our photos”

A spokesperson from the CSIRO said that they were confident the nation’s voters would flock to the populist policies put forward by the Federal and state governments, and that in the meantime the cost of running government would still outweigh the benefits.

“The costs of running government are just too high for people like me, so we’re going to start paying off some of our war chest,” said the spokesperson.

“It’s just that, we’ve been getting a lot of complaints from people like Michael, who are outraged by this kind of behaviour, so we need to make sure we can protect the bottom line,”

“One thing we’ve learned is that if you want to make the most of the Australian way of life, make sure your own political career is in the ditch!”

Rapidly Unhealthy Friend Arrives In Surry Hills To Test Pills Herself With Heroin

TEXT:

Growing up in the southern part of the Simpson Desert, Cynthia Smythe has never once felt the need to use her strength and self-confidence to push her friends to the limit.

This, however, has been the case for quite some time now, as the self-confessed ‘60% healthier’ woman from the Gold Coast confirmed she was once a heavy user of recreational drug abuse.

“I just can’t help myself, my friends. I’m just there with them every weekend and Monday evening,” explained the former City3Country girl who never let any form of a date get in her.

“The all-inclusive nature of these weekends and weeknights means that I don’t get to use all my strength to physically train for the first time in months,” she continued.

“In fact, I think I could be unhealthy by now. I haven’t been this active since I was training for the marathon.”

Not wanting to drag her way past her, Cynthia said she’s been looking for a ‘real deal’ to turn out for her and her friends to get them on the straight and narrow, with a yearning to find the soft core nature of her own desire.

“I just want a chance to join them in the gym, just not right away. It’s all I need right now.”

Shane Warne 'looking sharp’ for Australia opening clash in Melbourne

TEXT:

SHANE WARNE has been described by Cricket Australia as the ideal opener to lead the tourists into this summer’s Melbourne Cup final.

He is, however, quite obviously not really good at cricket – which is a bad look for Australia, who desperately needs Shane Warne to step up and deliver something spectacular.

Not even one of the better players in the game can be expected to give the visitors what they want – and that’s the mantra that Warne needs to take with him into this final, and a chance to finally prove that he is one of the greats.

In this test match, the Australians are a talented side that can turn on its head and still win – and a team that can turn on it and still lose.

But, as the saying goes, there’s always next Test.

So, how good would Shane Warne be at cricket if he was the perfect team captain?

Well, Shane Warne is the perfect captain because he’s a basketball player.

Playing in the 4×4 format, with a ball carrier, a runner and a batsman – Shane Warne can score like a double century every single game, and still be completely unrefined enough to score like a basketball player.

However, Shane Warne is also perfect because he plays for a fictional basketball team that actually exists in the real world, and isn’t coached by people from the real NBA or NHL teams.

That’s what makes him perfect – because they are basketball teams.

Yet another reason why Shane Warne is the perfect captain for Australia.

Millennial Visits Country Dad Who Thinks He’s A Superhero

A curious local young adult has today surprised her parents at a family wedding, when she revealed that she thinks she is a superhero.

Following her parents' request that she sit alongside her four siblings in a traditional Indian wedding, she has managed to weave all of her secret superpowers into a powerful blend of Asian influence – which her parents seem very interested in.

“I’m super-powered” she says.

“All these people know is that I’m super-dog”

However, her parents aren’t too keen on this new side of her personality, with a mix of alarm and confusion rising through their faces as she explains her plan.

“She’s a superhero!” says mum, Molly.

“She’s been super-mannered and put a bullet in her spine,”

Her teachers are in agreement.

“We’ve tried talking to her about it. She talks about her family background and her background in crime. I’m a criminal” says father, Glenn, a semi-retired local railroad foreman.

Local Woman Totally Fucken Wrong About the NBN

A local mum has today spent close to 30 minutes arguing with her children about the merits of the Coalition government’s National Broadband Network.

“It’s going to cost more than half a billion dollars” she said.

“This is the first time I’ve spent my life in a fucking schooner”

With her children gathering in the kitchen for an afternoon snack while her husband listened to the words of a radio announcer today, it appears Janet Brown (54) has completely misread her children’s expectations today.

“Why, so we can get the NBN for free?” she asked her youngest.

“It’s their own Private Line and they don’t need the cable plan anyway! I didn’t have to pay for it! And they won’t fucking see any discount on it!”

It is believed, that when her children are growing up, they’d be most likely playing rugby league, as their primary sport, and not the croquet, as is the case in metropolitan areas around the nation.

“Oh. So. Rugby league, huh? Yes” she said.

“We don’t need the cable plan anyway. I didn’t have to pay for it anyway. And they don’t need it anyway, they got it for free anyway. Not us. I mean, why should we have to pay for something? It’s free. You’ve said it already, it’s the free market right?”

Australia To Implement New Government Propositions To Limit Population Growth

TEXT:

In a paper that has been widely panned by environmental groups, the nation’s peak scientific body has outlined that a larger population is better.

The CSIRO said the findings show that a population of 10 million or more is the optimum size for growing the country.

“If we go on with our current trajectory, by 2050 Australia will be home to almost 100 million people,” said a senior CSIRO researcher.

“And this means that we need to plan for a much bigger country,”

“Which means planning for a lot bigger problems.”

The CSIRO paper, which was based on their own findings, outlined that a large population would have a negative impact on the country’s ability to tackle these problems.

“Our paper has found that a large population also makes the nation more likely to have problems with the environment,” said the researcher.

“In particular, the nation’s reliance on coal, oil, water, power, agriculture, mining, and water.”

The CSIRO pointed out that the effects of a large population growth were also felt by the country’s youth and ethnic minorities.

“People feel more isolated,” said the CSIRO researcher.

“It’s not just the youth, the nation’s ethnic minorities are also impacted by a larger population,”

“These groups are also more likely to have problems with Islam, which is often more vulnerable,”

“The graph we’ve just outlined is also applicable to all forms of immigration, as well as our reliance on visas to come here.”

Tragedy As Local Man’s Mates Fundamentally Endorse The Candidate

TEXT:

It is believed that one of Phillip Smith’s mates ran out of the game as soon as the ball was snapped – leaving him at an important juncture in the game.

It is believed that Smith had an epiphany while catching a few onside with a deep left-hander at the other end of the ground.

“He looked at me like I was crazy” said Smith.

“This isn’t how I imagined the game to have played out. This is football. You can’t make any mistakes!”

It is believed that the ball was snapped on the ground and it fell into the left-handers' hands – but only just.

It was quickly picked up by a short run out from the first, with Phillip Smith leading the line up the ground and crossing to the next player.

That was when the ball was snapped, and with it, the game.

Bosnia and Hercegovina’s first ever match at home, against a team they are actually somewhat confident against.

The Origin side are making noises about playing some high quality rugby league football, which would put them on a level playing field with the Broncos, Queensland Cowboys and the Wests Tigers, but no one is looking.

That has frustrated Phillip Smith, who is the ball-tampering expert.

“The game of rugby league is rugby league. They are also rugby league, you don’t make any balls out of a water bottle. And they are also in all good sports. I’m not saying that you don’t have to like them or anything, but it’s a bit funny, you know what I mean.”

After being finally vindicated last night, Smith told The Advocate that he’s not particularly worried about the news of the ball-tampering to the preservation of the integrity of the game.

“Nah fuck em. I’m going to be a good boy and support the Broncos cause I’m not playing for Brisbane so suck up. I’m a Bronco fan boy”

Local Fucking Is a Word Used To Indicate That He’s Happy

A local man has once again hit the bullseye today, after a week of the being recognised for his one liners and one-liners.

It seems that every new Australian has experienced at least one of these phrases being trotted out at some point this year, and it seems the use of the term ‘is a relatively recent phenomenon’ – as locals are usually ready to forgive any random cultural indiscretion that might be on display at any given moment.

Local marketing professional, Mikey Pickett (45) says he can’t believe that there hasn’t been a time where he could have stopped talking about how his half-hearted attempt at bringing a bit of Middle-Eastern culture to the backseat was also an attempt to bring a bit of international culture to the car.

“It’s weird, you know what I mean?” he says.

“You go somewhere and you’re looking for a sports car and it’s just like ‘Don’t park your lawn truck in the grass’ – and then you’re like ‘I can’t believe you didn’t get that part of the title right.”

“But you can’t really say that word unless you’re crazy like me. Like when I hear it in the car, I can’t believe my fucking ears.”

Mr Pickett says he’s never even heard it used as a derogatory term for some time – and says he’s taken it to a new level this afternoon.

“I’ve just never heard it used that way before. So I’m not sure. Maybe it’s just me being a bit sensitive because I don’t think Australia is actually that diverse… But yeah, the word is now sticking.

Uni Student Who Regrets It All Buts Unlikely To Learn Anything From His Presentation

TEXT:

With his hands in his pockets, a first-year university student was walking back to his dorm room last night after a long lunch with a colleague to find he’d forgotten everything he needed to remember.

Not that it was to learn anything.

Chad Greenholm, a young self-described tertiary student at Betoota Ponds, told The Advocate he’d have loved to go to the pub, a place where he’d be prepared to learn from someone in a similar position, but just couldn’t because it’s that uncomfortable sort of thing he’s not allowed to say in class.

He’d also have been more approachable to his professors, who he likes to talk to whenever he goes to class or when he’s come to them for dinner, and if they’re so inclined to talk to him.

However, his attending professor told him to cool off, with the idea being that he’d had just an embarrassing conversation with his wife a few months ago during his most recent class and he was starting to feel the pressure to get something out before they finished.

“You know what they say,” he said.

“Make sure you get a good night’s sleep at night. You don’t want to be out on the tiles this week. Don’t want to spend a credit hour speaking to a lecture but are wondering why you’ve never written a review on your last exam’s being crap you can’t give a f**k. Think about it, you don’t want to be a f**king quitter.”

“And then you’ve got your Mum going through your draw in the kitchen and telling you to go to sleep. And then you’re out on the tiles again. You don’t want to see any of the good stuff this week, the things you’ve learnt. They’ll be the real knowledge man. You’ve probably found some glitz and glamour in this course, and you want to use it.”

When asked by The Advocate whether he’d use it to his benefit, the young man laughed.

“No way. I’m getting a degrees in geo-politics. I’ve got to get a job in one day. Fuck my parents, that was the first time I was f**king serious.”

“I never wanted to be a teacher, I wanted to be a nurse” – The year 7 students

TEXT:

JOY HUNT IS A STATE OF EXPERIENCE in which the modern form of government, as it exists in modern Australia, is more suited to encouraging the empowerment of the weaker than to punishing the stronger. This is the narrative of school leavers year 7 high school classes and later combined with the official religious curricula at state secondary schools.

From a consistent course of study through a progressive body of study to a consistent set of credentials, there is always a large amount of room for self-doubt in Mr  and Ms enterprises.

In 2005, it was reported that 92% of Bachelor of Arts graduates did not identify as transgender, or at least said they didn’t know how to identify.

There is also alleged evidence of discrimination on the job exercises. That’s alleged discrimination on the job exercises. That’s alleged discrimination on the job exercises.

Included in that 92% of graduates who don’t identify as transgender is the fact that the majority of Australian teachers have never held any sort of government role.

The next logical step in the career progression of a teacher, is to be a senior advisor to a NSW government agency, or a NSW Liberal Member for Parliament.

Of the 2,412 former teachers in NSW, 1,313 are believed to be working as government servants at agencies which don’t share their political views on issues that have been acknowledged as ‘totally irrelevant’.

The two other candidates for the job of NSW Liberal leader are the only candidates officially registered in the State Liberal Party’s register of voters, but both of them have received not even a cursory attempt at an official title – and are actually just a range of acronyms thrown around by Labor voters.

Some of the most openly anti-gun measures introduced into the NSW Liberal Party over the last decade have been the inclusion of the terms ‘Sudanese’ and ‘Queer’ in their bios – even though those terms were used in the early 2000s to denote people who identify as the gay, lesbian or transgendered.

Tradesman Explores New Career As Locals Don’t Understand His Trades

TEXT:

Local gas and oil magnate, Anthony Mundine, has taken time out of his busy morning of greyhounds the Gallen Bridge to speak to The Advocate about how the locals don’t really get it.

From the minute he entered the building, to the minute he left it, it was a different world.

“I spent seven years on the Gallen Bridge. That’s what it’s like being young,” he said.

“You’re thinking about your next career, like investing in coal or something. But you can’t keep doing that, because you’re never old enough. There’s like five years left in your career, and nobody knows how to get into and out of the trades. So you’ve got to find another career, like becoming a public servant or something,”

“You just have to. It’s simple as that. It’s hard to be a service-industry professional when no one knows how to make a phone call or get a train to an hour late. It’s not for the faint of heart. It’s a wonderland for the uneducated, from what I’ve seen. They think you’re a bloke, a local builder. When I’ve asked these people who work in the facilities, all they could say was, ‘go away’, which is stupid. They don’t know the ropes, they’re not professionals. It’s so hard to get into the oil and gas industry,”

“Then you’re in the office for lunch with your new friends from school. You’ve got a couple beers in a pitcher of Centennial Wine then you go down to the wine bar and ask for the Riesling, you’re a professional. It’s fucking unfair.”

However, it’s not all bad news. Despite his indifferent approach to life, Mundine is still in the top five richest people in the country.

His new US girlfriend, Kelly, is currently in the top 10.

Her salary as a public servant comes in at $211,000 a year. At the time of writing, she’s still paying the bills for a three-bedroom home on the east side of town, plus two-car garage in the suburbs. She’s also on a $150,000 package from the NSW state government, the highest rate of public servant pay in the country.

Job Interview Questions Reveal No One Really Cares What You Have To Say

TEXT:

Looking to secure a job interview in a place that doesn’t offer you a meaningful opportunity, you might as well not even bother reading any of the job ad you have in front of you.

That’s according to a recent study by Australia’s peak scientific body.

The CSIRO’s Darlinghurst campus is famous for its pristine natural environment and abundant stench of pot-smelling gas.

However, according to their research, the people applying for a job don’t really care about what you have to say, unless you are a career employee.

While jobs advertised online and on remote job boards do tend to have higher salary and job security, the CSIRO’s most recent job interview data shows that everyone looking for work in local education is looking for the highest paying jobs with the most stress and emotional toll.

Unemployment among Australians aged between the ages of 25-40 is at its lowest point since the onset of welfare reform.

In fact, unemployment is so low that employers have complained that there’s actually been companies hiring people without a qualification, because they’re lazy.

In fact, just 1 in 5 job applications received a reply from the CSIRO saying they’ve got a vacancy.

Is Boring Government Work In Sydney Any Good?

TEXT:

With new MPs popping up every few months, our city’s elected officials have all but forgotten how to use our city’s laws and processes.

A recent report by the Institute of Municipal Finance (IMF) has found that as of the 2017 budget, Sydney has had a government work rate nearly three times higher than any other jurisdiction in Australia.

The five recommendations in the report outline steps the government can take to improve the government work rate.

The key findings are:

1) Make sure your community doesn’t have more than three MPs.

2) Make sure you get to work on time, whether you’re a new politician or a senior politician.

3) Be a local Young Liberal.

4) Hold a key cabinet position.

5) Ensure that you don’t be caught disrespecting any of the Aboriginal, Boring Labor And Liberal senators.

6) Encourage the state and federal politicians to speak their native language.

7) Make sure you see the Mayor when you’re in town and stay near him.

8) Ensure you have access to the drink and drug culture.

9) Ensure the barbering is sponsored, not paid.

10) Make sure your employer gets your full annual leave, even if you work in retail.

11) Ensure that you are one of the last ones in town when the family gets a new car or a new kitchen.

12) Make sure you get an occasional trip to the shops with your extended family.

13) Ensure the aged and the financially successful are invited to join you at the pub.

14) No young people should be eligible to be an MP.

15) No young people should be entitled to more benefits than the majority of the nation’s aged population.

16) Any organisation that advertises on youth TV should be publicly funded.

17) If you are working in retail, make sure it is at least 13 years old and you can make a good living.

18) No local publican should be entitled to more than $300,000 a year in compensation.

19) Any venue that sells beer on Sundays should be open for more than 25 people.

20) The FIFO workers unions should have a say in the situation.

21) No one should be entitled to have more than three separate pay rises for the same work.

22) No young people should be entitled to take the same pensions as senior citizens.

23) Public servants should be entitled to travel to remote parts of the nation to take a health scare.

24) No young people should be entitled to more than three separate pay rises for the same work.

25) No young people should be entitled to more than three separate pensions for the same work.

“Because I can’t get home in time to watch my beloved Greater Western Sydney Wanderers defeat the Melbourne Rebels. They’ve got to win, you see. So I’m not getting the bus. I’m going on the tram. I have to see Sydney first-class before I can do that. Because, I think my darling Greater Western Sydney Wanderers have the better side.”

After a few more minutes of deliberation, the pensioner says he’s in.

“I mean, it’s not that I don’t like them. I just don’t want to travel between Sydney and Melbourne with my old friend,” he said.

“But, I’ve got a thing for those street rats. They’re actually quite nice people. I don’t want to see these poor blokes reduced to tears.”

Votes to Stop Cricket Are Not Enough Reason for Australia To Stop Banging Tallies

TEXT:

The nation that famously rocked the Cricket World Cup in 2010, has now offered a virtual coin toss to resolve the current series. 

That means the cricketing nation is once again being called upon to take part in a ritual that many Australians have considered lost since the last time the Ashes were played in India.

The Coin Toss Australia “Carnival Cricket Experience” has been a staple of the Australian holidaying experience since the early 90s, and for good reason, says former fan Wade Tuttle.

“This is our only chance.”

“It is very rare that we can be voted in at the end of a Test match, so it is worth us taking a moment to reflect on how lucky we have it.”

A co-opting of the cricket as a vehicle for prejudice, isn’t the only excuse Australia has to not be, as cricket is often played by white people who don’t really watch cricket at all.

Another reason, and a recent institution, is that the game has become so unwieldy that someone who loves cricket can find themselves unable to play other forms of sport. 

This, as well as their cultural preferences, also allows the Cricket Team to not be blamed for this recent series of flops, as their lack of commitment and passion for the game is a far more important factor in the lack of game variety in Australia.

The Cowra Magpies and the Sydney Swans are in a class by themselves, just like the last time they played the Cricket World Cup. 

The Magpies are coming off a very disappointing series, that’s partly due to the fact that they don’t play much cricket, and partly because they don’t have any real stars, other than a few Origin players, and probably a few hookers. 

However, unlike the Magpies and the Sydney Swans, this is a perfect example of how Australia is better than them, because they are playing the Cricket World Cup for money, and the people of Australia have it better than them. 

As the ball-tampering scandal continues to expose an embarrassing trend that most people in this country just don’t want to get into, the fact that Cricket Australia will not budge on their response should give Australian cricket fans hope that they will finally get a few players from the national side sent home. 

Hinting at the possibility of a Chris Pyne-style intervention, most casual cricket fans would suggest that the magpies might pull out of their trap and send a few players to the Gabba, but the reality is that the sport is too far gone for that sort of thing.

Cyclists Stuck In The Heat Until They Pull Into

Racing fans are pleading with the cycling public to take a leaf out of their book when it comes to keeping the temperature down at the local race track, with some telling The Advocate that the most livable area in town is the bottom right hand corner of the town.

Local cyclist, Clod Conwell says that he has been stuck inside a circuit for close to a minute now, and is so annoyed he’s almost forced himself to leave.

“It’s like, almost impossible to get your feet into the ground”

“Just give up on the sun”

But some locals have taken the advice and moved the town’s most powerful racehorse to the other side of the track.

“I think I’ve tried to leave this circuit with a pair of little red riding boots,” says local man Andy Shooter, who’s ridden the animal for about two years now.

“That little pocket of air really rubs you the wrong way”

“People are like, ‘OK, you can keep going in the water, you idiot. Go for a bit of a day trip anyway, why not? Just stop the bleeding when you’ve got a big red sticker on your collar and you’re old and bald,’ so my patience has run out”

However, the outspoken resident of the bottom right hand corner of the town has hit back at those who call him an idiot.

“I’m not in the business of breaking the law or anything like that” he said.

“And if people think I am, well, I guess I’m the only way to be.”

Accused of being a tool for the NSW state government, Wilburton’s education has always been a point of pride for him and his close friends

TEXT:

It is a late day in the Australian government heartland and all eyes are on the NSW Liberal National Party as they continue to investigate the possible ‘dirty tricks’ being played by their state’s premier by their very own Trojan Horse investigation.

Premier Gladys Berejiklian has taken heat for her handling of the investigations into the possible leaking of government documents and the state Labor party’s handling of the Brown Snake methane crisis – as well as any kind of in-kind support of the NSW Liberal Party’s ongoing project to buy up every cent of property developers has ever need.

Brown Snake methane, the third most damaging methane released by developers in Australia, is a powerful greenhouse gas and it is currently being released from an old gas well in the lower North Shore of the Blue Mountains, south of Brisbane, the source of most gas leakages.

The gas is expected to kill one life every week and has been the subject of an all out investigation by the NSW State Labor Party this week.

“The immediate priority for us is to prevent this particular leak from becoming another Whitlam-era disaster,” said Premier Berejiklian.

“We are targeting those who have been leaking the most methane and have caused the most damage. We will not allow a Labor government to protect the vested interests of their rich friends.”

The shock allegations come as new figures show the number of leaked documents to be increasing dramatically – but Premier Berejiklian has said there is a lot more work to be done before the leaked documents become a public health issue.

“This is only the tip of the ice berg,” she said.

“This is just one more example of the lobbyists who have been working hard to get us in this mess. We need to do more work.”

Premier Berejiklian has also called for a royal commission into the leakages – but said that would include funding for that kind of work.

Married Gay & Lesbian Teacher Hasn’t Hearted That This Locally-Hated Community Might As Well Be Jewish

TEXT:

A local married gay and lesbian teacher has spoken of the heartbreaking disparity between the stereotypical image of this historically conservative community and the actual demographic of this city, telling The Advocate this morning that they’ve had to talk through some of the sentiments that are being expressed by people who actually aren’t like them.

Jenny Fraser, a 40-year-old from Betoota Heights High in Betoota Grove, told our reporter that she’s often seen the group of gay kids who hang out at the regional park with their girlfriends when the sun goes down, to get away from the high school or get high in the gay clubs.

But when her students started to go to lunch with their parents, she said she knew this place was not like the other ‘os-r-s’ places in town.

“I mean, this is the gayest town in Australia,” she said.

“And the gayest teachers in the country. They’ve got to be. That’s why we vote Liberal,”

“But here I am. I’m a gay, too. So I can understand why people might feel that way,”

“But I’m also a teacher, so I’m guilty of stereotyping the place.”

Fraser then told The Advocate that she’s never met any of the people who come to their jobs disappointed at the results of the same-sex marriage plebiscite – but only because their generation doesn’t understand the LGBTI community as well as she does.

“I know you can’t be a lesbian and a teacher at the same time, but how many lesbians can get into both roles? How many teachers are lesbians? Why?” she asked.

“I mean, you can be a lesbian into teaching, too. It’s just that most of the girls she’s getting with don’t know how to shed the hijab and into a nice girl’s shoes,”

“The same goes with the gay community. We’ve got a distinct lack of cultural sensitivity. A lack of empathy, you know? This isn’t Israel’s Sinai Desert, it’s far more heathen than that.”

Our reporter reached out to the Prime Minister’s Office for comment, but have yet to receive a reply.

Universe Rewards member The Ringer pretends to care about sport after Nationals loss

TEXT:

As we near the halfway mark of the 2017 season, it seems that many Nationals fans have forgotten just how much of a joke this season is.

Not by accident, either.

When you take into account just how many people were left off last year and the fact that there isn’t as many female players to be found on social media, you begin to wonder just how the Nationals got to where they are.

Like many other Nationals fans, I am a big supporter of rugby union, and I don’t care about sport as much as I care about rugby league or cricket.

So I’m not surprised that many of my female friends have chosen to hang the majority of their stats around the Ballantyne, and I’m not surprised that many of them are upset that they weren’t a part of the team that won this competition.

I’m a no-brainer. They deserve to win this competition. So if you want to talk about rugby league or cricket, you better believe the next century will be dominated by sports that people enjoy watching.

When you go the other way and ask about rugby league or cricket, the same rules apply. The only real way to enjoy a match of rugby league or cricket is to sit at home and watch some good, old-fashioned, hard-hitting cricket. And if you want to talk about AFL or NRL, you better believe they’re a much more domestic affair.

So don’t come crying to me when I say I’m not a rugby league or cricket fan, it’s not my cup of tea, it’s rugby league, go and get a nice little girl and keep watching hoops.

I’m not a rugby league or cricket fan, it’s only because I’m a young guy who’s read about the game through the newspaper or something, you know. That’s not my cup of tea, it’s rugby league, go and find yourself a young ladies team, put some ‘B’ on their jersey, whatever that means. If you’re a rugby league or cricket fan, just shove it in your face. I’m a rugby league fan.

It will be interesting to see if this constant stream of people asking about ‘what’s going on in rugby league or cricket’ continues as the Nationals are well on their way to becoming a modern sporting powerhouse.

Labor Weak On Israel-Palestine, But Still Strong On Israel-Us

TEXT:

The ALP has just taken another hit today, this time in the upper house, after it was revealed that they have been planning the following day for months, but had the sense not to ask Tony Abbott to be their leader.

From a weak opposition motion aimed at giving al jazeera more access to the very same organisations they were previously unable to do anything about, to a motion that called for the immediate end to the Knesset and re-appointment of a Chinese billionaire as foreign minister, the ALP are left wondering if they are as weak as the Conservatives.

A motion that was defeated on principle, because the public wanted the ALP to be stronger. However, that wasn’t the only thing the ALP did wrong this week.

By doing nothing on the issue of Israel-Palestine, the ALP has left the majority of the nation’s electorate wondering if they are as weak as the Conservatives.

One man, who voted for both Bob Katter in the last election, has spoken of the shock and confusion he experienced when he had the idea that his party was just going to take another stab at being the strongest possible party, but hadn’t bothered about what kind of lobby it was actually using to defeat the Coalition government’s policies.

“I didn’t know we were going to be the only party in this place that actually cares about what this country’s thinking is,” said the man named Peter Dutton.

“It’s all happening at the same time, the same time, it’s just that I wasn’t the one who initiated it”

“It was a really tough call”

“You’ve got to be really good at what you do, because you’ve got no choice”

“Or, if you’ve got any choice, you have to be really good at soccer – and that’s what I was. I guess I’m lucky to have played for my hometown team. The other ones are a little bit harder to get into. They’ve got the best soccer players in the world, you know?”

Report: Australian Wasps Fans Going Full Bit At The Tavern

TEXT:

The term ‘wasps fans’ has come to be applied to anyone who regularly attend a football match at a particular stadium. Often used to describe those who enjoy the rugby side of sport, as well as their rugby union team, the term applies to people who enjoy their rugby union team as much as their rugby football team.

The term was first applied to the rugby community in the early 1990s by the Southern Rugby League team in an attempt to make the team more appealing to non-rugby-rugby-americans. From there it has spread to other sporting codes, with AFL fans and rugby union supporters coming to terms with the term in the early 2000s.

During the last couple of years the term has become somewhat of an unofficial term for the Australian rugby union fans.

“We’re just here to support the team,” said one supporter, who asked to remain anonymous.

“At the moment, the boys aren’t winning many matches, but I think we’re going to look strong in a few months,”

“We’re not into this rugby football thing because we’re not overly competitive at the moment, but I can see the Waratahs making a few changes in the coming years, so yeah.”

Another wasp fan and former player, James (55) was keen to remind us that there’s no such thing as too many wasps.

“Yeah, we actually aren’t that good at football these days. But yeehaw, we love rugby union man! [laughs] There’s a bit of glamour about it, yeah? Well, not glamour, but the sense of being far, far away from the everyday life. Rugby is just a bit more fun!”

Man Accused Of Having A Shittest Cock Is Broke On Re-Entering University

A local man who is supposedly ‘the type of guy that’d be good at sport’ says he’s just got a little bit too comfortable.

The 19-year-old victim of this morning’s racial slur claims that when he’d drop into his room to finish a homework assignment or catch up with some friends he’d often find a spot by the door to have a little bit of a chill.

“He usually finds a good spot right by the door,” said the man. “I just don’t know why he’s got a wall behind him and a coffee table beside the door. That’s pretty much the definition of a shittest person.”

The victim, a recent University of Sydney graduate who got his start studying at the HECS , says he often feels uncomfortable with sharing his bathroom space with people.

“You know, like everyone. You don’t know anybody. And to be honest, you can only use one of the cubicles and that’s the one that I usually have in the shower. That’s because I’m a pretty shittest person, which is why most people in this city think I’m a pretty shittest person.”

The man’s former roommate says there’s always been a little bit of racial discrimination to his apartment and there’s always a chance that things might have changed if he didn’t get a tattoo that day.

“It’s just a fucking shame that it is where he lives. You know, the white people in this city don’t have a lot of history to speak about,” said the man.

Elderly Woman Unsure If Philanthropic Giving To Research Organisation Is Still Ethical

TEXT:

A local woman of the final decades of her life has this morning expressed her uncertainty as to whether the amount of money being donated to a research organisation is still ethically acceptable.

At least, that’s what she’s assuming, given the track record of her organisations work over the last 30 years.

This is a common occurrence amongst those with terminal illnesses, as they often don’t know if they’ll ever live another day, because they’re so old and sick.

Debbie Armstrong, a 90 year-old woman from the caucasus of Betoota’s Lake District, told The Advocate that she’s never really understood the difference between research and philanthropy.

“Yeah, I used to think that giving money to research was wrong, but that was until I got this old, sick, disabled daughter with a terminal illness who needlessly pushes myself to death each day,” she said.

“So I thought maybe this is all just philanthropic?”

When asked if she thought giving to research organisations was ethical, Armstrong said she was unaware of the difference.

“I’ve read about it, but I never thought about it ethically, because I was raised Catholic and I spent most of my time at St Columbus. But I read about these new groups who donate to research, and I thought, fuck, maybe they’re good people,” she said.

“Maybe I should donate? I’m not a broke person.”

Ms Armstrong’s daughter, Melody, also commented on the apparent conflict of interest, saying that she thinks Philanthropic Giving is wrong and unethical, and she thinks it’s unethical to give to research organisations that might profit from spreading cancer.

“It’s like giving to the Indian Space Agency, you know, to go to Mars? That’s the right way to go about it, and I think you’re also the right way to go about it,” she said.

“If there’s one thing I’m sure about, it’s that we’re all going to die soon and that means there’s no way we can live without hope.”

New 'Aeon’ app lets users see if they’re really doing it for the money

In a remarkable twist of fate, a popular app meant to lure young Australian men and women into the unknown world of travel has gone completely unnoticed by those who downloaded it.

Bounty Hunter, a leading Australian app which tracks “money-making” schemes such as those offered by the app, has since been removed from the Google Play Store, after developers realised it is not relevant to their purposes.

However, the incident has not stopped the thousands of young Australians who downloaded the app to begin with, from making a killing, or luring men and women into a life of illicit drug-dealing and online escorting.

“It’s that simple” said one person who was unhappy with the outcome of the app.

“They have to be coming out of a reputable source.”

The Advocate reached out to a number of Australian men who downloaded the app but only received an out of order response.

“I didn’t give it a second thought. It’s always coming back,” said a man named Trent.

“Aeon is the only app that really gives you a head start when it comes to looking for work.”

“But when you get down to the wire, when you’ve got your application down to the last qualified applicants, when you’ve got people like I come knocking, you just have to put the phone down and let them know that you’ve got a small-time background operation, so that they’d like to see your side of the story”

ABC Disagrees With Turnbull On His Plan For Nationalism

TEXT:

The most powerful men in the country are furious with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull over the idea that our nation’s refugees should be resettled in to our own country.

Answering a call for a no-refugee-state for our nation’s dispossessed, a prominent member of the Western Australian Liberal Party has lashed out at the Government’s policy regarding the issue.

Local man, Jock Campbell (55), says he’s never felt it’s in our nation’s best interest as a multicultural democracy to be dependent upon an economic elite of ‘Third World Quality’ and are unable to claim a place among their own kind.

“No more than 10,000… Only a third of them are fit to go, but they don’t belong in the country, they belong in a camp on the Goulburn train track”

“What we need is just enough so they can get their passports stamped and get out,”

“The first day they’ll be able to get their own houses,”

Mr Jock says Malcolm Turnbull needs to put this idea to a vote of Australian’s like him and everyone else, before he’s gone.

“You know, the people in the country, which are the most educated and best equipped to make life hard for the rich, can vote for the greatest competitor of all.”

“The only thing I’m going to do is head down to the Brisbane airport and ask them if they want to stay and fight with their fellow countrymen.”

“If they don’t want to join me, then I can offer them up to go to the game of cricket with their countrymen. But we won’t be able to fight each other in the country unless Malcolm has ‘decided to give up the whole useless job’ for a better gig.”

Australia’s Chief Scientist Quits The Federal Labor Party After Even More Horrific Reports Emerge

TEXT:

A small country town in central Australia has been left scratching their heads this morning after revelations that a local scientist, who’s actually been going full bore with the ‘political career’ that was promised to him by Labor, has left the party.

This comes after a whole year of reports of scientists being openly threatened and publicly shamed by both the ALP and National Party, with far too many resulting in resignations.

The two major parties, Labor and National, both insisted they’d look into the reports, and finally, the ABC. 

However, the scientists all tell The Advocate that if these reports are true, it means that the main parties have shown a clear preference for the Liberal party at the very top of the federal order – when it comes to science and clean technologies.

“I don’t get it, just the other night, when the Greens and minor parties came up and said, ‘look this boy has a talent for making things explode and stuff’… they were simply ignored.” said one researcher.

“So, why do we keep seeing this? Why are scientists leaving the party?”

The member of the CSIRO explained that due to both a lack of funding and also a notable lack of talent within the ALP, scientists are now ready to accept any offer to join their ranks. 

“Basically, what we’ve found is that scientists are just content at the very top, with a few important jobs and that sort of thing,” he said.

“The other places aren’t as competitive, it’s hard to be a top-knot citizen scientist when there’s no clear path to a role within the federal government.”

Malcolm Roberts takes on Tony Abbott in One Nation-tech-boffie-chat

TEXT:

QUEENSLAND SUPREME ADVOCATE Tony Abbott is a useful, albeit a flawed, member of the Australian Parliament, according to the nation’s two-party-preferred senator.

This comes as the far-right Christian party looks to pull away from the two-party-preferred backbencher…and two-party-preferred senators from different parties.

At the centre of this two-party-preferred intrigue is the fact that Tony Abbott is a 4th-generation citizen who has roots in the Native American tribes of the United States. And that he used to be a Mormon – which means he isn’t a member of any recognised religion in Australia, let alone one that claims to be a religion that actively discriminates against homosexuals.

Speaking candidly to The Advocate at the Gold Coast this morning, Senator Roberts said he’s found the Tony Abbott situation quite complicated.

“This is the first time I’ve had to deal with someone who claims to be a practicing member of a religion that isn’t a religion,” said the retired ­ex-RSS minister.

“It’s quite an interesting case, I’m sure there’s many elements that link him to cult-like practices, but I’ve been trying to unravel these things for months,”

“So I spoke to this bloke for about an hour and it turns out he’s an elected official who has already been confirmed as a member of a cult, so we are really at a crossroads here.”

Greens Party Leader’s Gay Marriage Policy Unveiled As Solution To Australian Abstinence

Australia Day is a day of remembrance for most Australians, but the progressives inside the Liberal Party are making a point of excluding themselves from this annual national holiday.

This year, it’s a big issue.

The anniversary of Australia’s declaration of independence from the British crown, which kicked off on 12 March 1800, has become a potent political issue for our country’s progressive elite, as the issue continues to dominate public conversations across the nation.

However, while the issue has been discussed endlessly in parliament for the last few decades, until recently, no one had any idea that it existed.

But now that we’ve uncovered the detail that this year, the day has passed without a national conversation about the decision, which is a fairly bizarre cultural commentary on the behaviour of a tiny island of homogenous white people.

The Advocate spoke to the fearless and righteous nature of the Left about this issue, and their view of how the mainstream media is attempting to spin this issue into a left-wing talking point.

“We don’t want to talk about it,” said Malcolm.

“We’d be more than happy to talk about it if you would have us help you destroy the country’s flag, make us look like a degenerate effeminate white effeminate, and make you rich enough to not need us.”

“And we will be happy to help you spread the word about how proud you are of being a white effeminate white man who likes making up shit about indigenous people as well,” he said.

“Otherwise we’d be going back to being an all-white party.”

Following the success of the first instalment, Batman will now be able to take the Poison Ivy theme to a whole new level.

The new villain will be playing off his old rival, the Joker, by wearing a black silk suit with a long black shirt, making him look like he’s a brutal criminal mastermind who is better than the average person, and at the same time, worse than the average person.

With Merlot-Eaters, Batman will be able to channel his inner psychotic into an actual psychotic, as he finally has the tools to take down the Penguin.

However, it’s not just him who is getting the better of the two versions of the dark art, as Merlot-Eaters will be able to communicate with the people who don’t know the ins and outs of the Batman universe, by having conversations out of character.

“You wanna hear me out?” he asks the willing, blindsided readers of this article.

“A moment of silence for the victims of last night”

Local Cypriot Family Quite Afraid Of Australian Immigration Policy

At least 10 Lebanese and two Australian-born Palestinian families will be forced to relocate to the bleak coastal Australian community of the Australian mainland in the near future under a new Government policy announced by the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull today.

The Turnbull government’s plan for a new Middle Eastern community on the Australia’s Eastern Seaboard, has been met with great alarm and fear by local Cypriots, who say they’re afraid it will be the first family to move to Australia since their family arrived in this country more than 30 years ago.

The proposed policy for refugees, asylum seekers and migrants has sparked outrage amongst many in the Australian community, with many saying that it does not go far enough, and that it will create a large backlog of people trying to enter our country.

“These people are not Australian citizens, and while they may be eligible for some form of welfare, it’s not enough,” said one prominent community organiser, Sayed Alymaz.

“As far as I can see, we have already earmarked significant funds for welfare,”

“The issue is not whether these people are good people, the issue is whether these people are not.”

When asked whether these people were Australian citizens, Sayed Alymaz said that they weren’t.

“I don’t care what their ethnicity is, we don’t need them here,”

“We need to get our priorities straight, this isn’t a matter of whether these people are Australian citizens.”

The former representative of the country who is also a horticulture teacher at a regional Aussie School, is a former ball-tampering champion and all rounder, according to the people close to the young man. 

The local community official, who also did a few trip to the Mudgee Supermax in the last year, spoke to The Advocate today about why you wouldn’t want to do any of the work that he’s put in to getting you a haircut and a new pair of boots. 

“I didn’t start doing shit,” explained the young man who somehow ended up in the Socceroos World Cup squad of 2015 and 2016. 

“I started doing… Um… Dope,” explained the man who now has a job as a full time coach at a regional Aussie School that he says is just a little bit better than some of the others. 

“A lot of hard earned sweat.” 

“As I’m a former representative of a country I’m supposed to be just like everyone else, I’ve worked hard in my whole life to get where I am. And now I’m supposed to be doing shit, like trying to be the best fucking Socceroos player on the team?” 

“How are you supposed to justify spending all that time and effort when the country isn’t even doing any of it?” 

“It’s like, a lot of people don’t even get it that the country is shit but anyway that’s my two cents.”

Joyce Weighs Up A Couple Things He’s Given Up On In The Moment

TEXT:

One of the key issues that remains unresolved in the National Party is the future of the party, according to Barnaby’s internal sources.

A report by The Advocate this morning found the morale of the Nats has sunk to an all-time low, with only 40 of the party’s 65 candidates feeling that they’ve earned the right to sit in the lower house.

However, it’s not just the Nats who are feeling the pinch, with the federal party as a whole also looking to release a serious drought this year.

Speaking to The Advocate this morning, Barnaby Joyce explained that he’s made a point of giving up on the past 12 months – in the same way he’s always done.

“Not in the sense that I gave up on the fishery, or the mineral-rich waters of the Murray-Darling, but in the sense that I gave up on the idea that politics exists outside of this country,” he said.

“You know what they say about politics being a family affair. I have a 3-year-old on a government salary now and I’ve got one of his brothers back working as a barista at the same time,”

“So it’s not like I’m taking the 3rd-world country of Bangladesh to put my political ideals on the line for. But it’s the things I’ve done in the past that’s being overlooked. I’m not even considering the big issues, like what the size of the Australian dollar is or who owns the Minerals Rights. Those are two things I’m keeping in my mind.”

More to come.

Alan Jones’ Autobiography Slated For Free Online Version

TEXT:

In some breaking news out of the Deep North this morning, the World Wrestling Entertainment Chairman and CEO, Eddie Guerrero, was announced as the next subject of a book being written by the 2nd-highest-selling newspaper in the country.

This comes after the announcement by WWE that a biography of the octagon supremo, will be released for the first time.

Jones, however, has today stated that he feels a sense of nostalgia is being produced by the book.

“This book has been something that I want to tell people about for years. This book has been something that I have been holding close to my chest for many years,”

“In fact, I’ve even had my biography with my whole family and they all love it,”

“I guess it was the perfect medium to tell these people that I am the true Eddie Guerrero. That I am the middleman,”

As part of the deal, Jones will also be playing down rumours that his new nickname is ‘The Black Pigeon’, stating that he knows there are a lot of people out there that just want to have fun with him.

“It’s just that, I don’t want them to think I’m trying to be some kind of Asian spy. I’m just trying to have a good time on the mic,”

“If you are one of the people that came up to me after the match at Stuttgart and said I’d called you a ‘nigger’, then I guess you’ve seen me in a bad light,”

WWE, however, has today denied that the new nickname is racist.

“We’ve had people come up to me saying they wanted to ‘call me something they don’t like’ as well as the fact that they’ve never heard of me in the first place. And I don’t care, because it’s not my fault,”

“I just got called a ‘nigger’ by some roided up bit of shit.”

A popular SuperBowl and SuperBowl commentator, Tony Korn, made it clear that Eddie Guerrero is not the real Eddie Guerrero when it comes to his previous comments.

“What’s the matter with you little prick?” he wrote.

“Man, he’s looking pretty good these days. He must be a big nigger. You know, the real Eddie Guerrero,”

“Didn’t you see the pin drop, didn’t you? The real Eddie Guerrero would’ve dropped that pin like some cocky fuck from the West End. He’d be dead now, aye?”

Jones has also had to clarify comments he made earlier where he referred to Eddie Guerrero as ‘Whitey’ or ‘Bully’.

“So yeah, I’ve been called a number of things. Not racist things. I guess you could say I look like a few different things. Black Pigeon, Nelly, Killer Mike, nah. Nelly, Jay-Z. Gotti, Fat Boy Slim, Biggie Smalls, I don’t know. These days, I just get called a ‘Blacky’ and it’s not even really that bad,”

“I’ve always had a soft spot for African-Americans and their struggles, I just think it’s so funny that I have been called a number of things when I have obviously done nothing wrong.”

Robbie Hunt stands down as ABC board chair after news that they’re about to be sold to a Puma consortium

TEXT:

The ABC’s board has today announced that they will sell the media empire that the Board of Seven’s majority shareholder Michael Sock bought in 2014 for $580 million, to a consortium led by media giant Rupert Murdoch.

The news has stunned the board, with some board members saying that they’ve never seen the ABC this dysfunctional before.

Mr Sock was given a six-year plan to make the ABC more like a Puma brand, but unfortunately for all parties, that plan has all but failed.

“It’s very sad news, the ABC has been working very hard to become a Puma brand,” said one board member.

“They have promised us endless new public and minority funding. They have promised us endless new staff. They have even promised us the abolition of the ABC as we know it today.”

“But it looks as though they have every intention of becoming what Rupert Murdoch describes as a Puma-brand media organisation,” said the board member.

“It’s not a good look. It’s not good for the shareholders. It’s not good for the staff. The media tycoon is a great guy but I would like to see the ABC become a Puma-brand media organisation,”

“Unless he doesn’t want us to be forced into buying media empire owned by Rupert Murdoch. In which case, I would have no problem with the ABC becoming an independent media entity in Australia, like what Puma is doing in other countries around the world.”

The Advocate reached out to ABC management for comment, but have yet to receive a reply.

Report: Keating Was A Pretty Good Partner

TEXT:

A recent report by the Australian Hoteliers Association has found that the 1986-1988 Keating Government was a pretty good partner for the country, particularly when compared to current Prime Minister Scott Morrison.

“They made me a very rich man. The old Keating government was pretty much like the old Morrison, but we have a bit of a different flavour” says David Jones staff member, Marcellus Jones.

“The old Keating was pretty much like current Prime Minister Scott Morrison today. A) He knew the then in the bush country b) That he is the true Australian c) He took the country down a peg.”

“I’d also say that the new Keating a) has the confidence of a premiership-winning PM b) At least has a real working knowledge of the local agricultural issues.”

However, despite these pretty obvious character traits, the reports of David Jones staff members being a little bit too excited about the current federal government isn’t going to stop them from ringing up an empty room for tonight’s wedding.

“We’ll just be a couple more taps on the scale with the Australian toasts and an occasional Marrickville round of drinks” said Mr Jones.

Opinion: Trump’s America Is Dead

TEXT:

In my recent article for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) entitled ‘The Road to Ruin’ I mentioned that the United States has entered a phase where the ultimate judgement will be rendered by the ultimate outsider.

That the American voters, after a couple of decades of both establishment politics and a Judeo-Christian mindset, are ready for an unprecedented post-factual reality television show-in-the-making.

As our president, Donald Trump, stated in his Australian TV appearance last year:

“Nobody has the right answers, except for the real answers”

“If you know what I’m talking about, then no one has the right answers. Unless you’re the fella in question – then you know what I’m talking about”

Trump’s repeated references to “our press corps” have been interpreted by many Australian media commentators as the final nail in the coffin for the liberal media.

However, most of these commentators – including The Advocate’s incoming regional masthead editor, Neville Hastie – have confirmed that this coming election is a little bit of a mess.

“I just don’t think the voters are ready for a whole wrap-up of Australia’s media landscape,” said the very weak-minded radio presenter.

“If you’ve been paying attention, you know that these left-wing commentators are taking the show down to a new level,”

“Some have even gone as far as to suggest that Donald Trump is on the verge of becoming a full-blown manic depressive disorder,”

“Unless the voters have been offered a chance to beat him in a fair game of cricket, then I’m pretty much the only logical explanation for his win.”

Woman Who’s Never Left The Virgin Mary Still Loves Having Sex With Jesus

TEXT:

There’s an air of celibacy about Margaret Reynolds’ ­persons that surrounds her – a quality that’s been somewhat undermined by the fact that she’s never been a Catholic.

“I just never felt comfortable in the Catholic church, it was too isolated, too macho,” she said.

“So I was wondering, did you know, there’s a woman who actually was one of the greatest apostles of the church. The woman who changed the church in the world, literally. She was the greatest theologian that has ever lived,”

“That was Jesus, right?”

As a result of this, Margaret says she’s never felt able to leave the church – ever.

She says that although she doesn’t consider herself as a Christian, she still feels an almost absolute obligation to follow the church’s teachings on a whole range of topics.

“It’s like a holy obligation,” she said.

“To love, to hate, to not to make love,”

“But yeah, I guess it’s a thing that I need to get into before I leave the church. Because Jesus, as an individual, has done more harm to me than good.”

Margaret says that while she feels very lucky to be where she is, she doesn’t necessarily feel that way about being a member of the church.

“I used to be a pretty good student, I guess I was a little bit of an asshole but hey. The church is a place of people who make terrible mistakes,” she said.

“That’s not the same as being an asshole.”

Report: Suicide Note Is Exactly What It Looks Like

TEXT:

Australian domestic violence and suicide note is not an actual thing, it has been confirmed.

After research was conducted on the phenomenon, it has been revealed that the main factor in the trend is that young people are writing the notes in a way that minimises their chances of dying by strangulation.

Since the early 2000’s, the practice of writing a suicide note has grown dramatically, especially amongst young, inner-city creatives, in an effort to seem cooler and more popular than their friends.

The trend has since spread to the suburbs, as well as to more cosmopolitan areas with bad air quality.

The news is also confirmed by a recent report by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, finding that the suicide note has become more popular since last year’s Rio Olympics, as well as the last few Olympic Games.

It is believed that this phenomenon is just one of many trends that Australia’s youth are becoming aware of.

Inclusion, however, the suicide note is not without its own peculiarities.

For one, it is not recognized as an offence in Australia if someone writes a note to the press or another person not recognisable to the community. Secondly, the note does not appear on suicide watch lists, meaning a person cannot be under threat of being killed by their own suicide, except by a police officer or someone with a gun.

The study has also discovered that people who write a suicide note often complain about Australia Day being a bit cold.

Teachers Need To Do More Than Just Whip Out Their Ringer And Soundtrack Anytime They Hear

The Labor Party’s election platform has been a lightning rod for controversy, as many trade unions, historians and every other third-wave leftie looking for a cause.

While the party line may seem clear on many issues, such as decrim and tax breaks for the rich, and eradicating State Government ghettos, it has been hard to find anything on the school policy pertaining to learning more about the world’s most ancient civilizations.

The current attitude from the Labor Party has been that you need to raise your hand if you don’t want to be lectured on “humanism” and other matters that are allegedly “nostalgic” and “on the verge of collapse”

However, with Labor still in power in Queensland, local teachers and students have been getting the message that they don’t have to get up and put a crisp beat on their vocabularies.

“In fact, there’s more value in a decent patina than in one of those broken Chinese dishes” says one teacher.

“It’s very important to listen to our politics when we’re discussing these things”

“We can’t win this election without listening to people who have been playing a lot of Brazilian music for a few decades now”

Niggy’s Last Words On Playing Field Are Less Titillating Than His First

TEXT:

The Ponds farmers have been praised this afternoon by their friends and neighbours for their late October‐December work ethic – a trait that has seen them through a lot of hard work.

Niggy’s manager, Rhett [56], says his kids appreciate him for the hard work he has put in – a trait that is appreciated by his neighbors and the wider district.

“He used to drive us all the way from Betoota to Perth,” said Rhett.

“But he’s always been pretty good about telling us when he’d be working from the beach on a Sunday,”

“But now he’s starting to pull away. I didn’t know who he was until he started doing all this work up in Ponds. It’s no lie, it really upsets the cunt. I’ve tried to speak to him about it but he’s fucked me right up.”

However, when we spoke briefly to the 48-year-old early this morning at the Betoota Heights detachment of the Northern Territory RDO, he said he’s not complaining.

“The boys just put the stubbie in and let me tell you, it’s fucking shot for a new moon,” he said.

“I’ve been banging that bit to suss out these wee fellas for a real sore spot in the back of the head,”

“They’ve been down there working really hard. I’m fucking shell-shocked right now, my brain is doing nothing but fill me with fear. Fuck it, mate. Let the salty rain wash over me like it’s water on a beach. That’s the life I live.”

It Came From A Vineyard In South-East England That Gay Couple Couldn’t Find, Because It Wasn’t On Google Maps

TEXT:

Sister Marigold and her sister, Sister Amanda, are from England’s south-east and hail from the country’s most important wine region, the Provence region. As of the 2008 census, there were over 1.7 million people in the Provence region – which is roughly the same size as the state of Maine. With an average annual temperature of 45 – the area is dry, with occasional snow falling every winter.

With the warmer weather and relatively low rainfall in the region, the couple say they could never find the place they were looking for.

“It’s just so hard to find” said Marigold, who was raised in a stable environment in a decent suburban home.

“It used to be this close to the coast, but it’s just a bit further out there”

Amanda says she’s glad she didn’t have to travel further south to start from. But this isn’t the first time they’ve been in trouble.

With Kids Left Out Of Geelong Cabbies, Man Has To Give Them To Be Kind

TEXT:

For the first time in his life, Dale Dixon was left to pick up the pieces after a painful and unnecessary confrontation with a group of kids from a nearby taxi rank.

The close friend and former bonded-cabbie has done the street by his side for over 30 years, even if it means losing the right to his taxi licence.

However, today in Geelong, the 60-year-old was just trying to find out more about a local children’s club that helps disadvantaged inner-city street kids find jobs in the suburbs.

“I just hope they know that you don’t get upset if you’re a part of their situation,” he said.

“I know that we can have fun together, have a few RMs with the kids and just enjoy our time here in Geelong, but this trip with them has been a bit much,”

“I got home and a brief moment of peace. I had to go back to my car, just as the kids had to their taxi. I got a new R3 with a broken suspension and a full tank of petrol. Then we had to pull up to their taxi rank and watch some television for 45 minutes while they thought up a few ways to help me catch a cab.”

Dixon said that when he returned to his car, the majority of the half-white kids in the group had already grabbed their phones to see how he’d done.

“I had to explain to them the reason why I needed to speak to them about my concerns,” he said.

“It just became too much to handle, I had to get out of the car and walk towards their cabbies,”

“They didn’t understand why I had to talk to them, they thought I was just another poor urban with a penchant for writing letterbox envelopes and conversation.

“We’re Going To Need A Few Big Grams” Says Australian Legislative Council

TEXT:

The Australian Legislative Council has forecast that the combined emissions from burning fossil fuels this year will come in at approximately 10 billion tonnes, roughly the same as all the traffic accidents we had last year.

“That’s a big number” said the council’s senior climate scientist, Professor Kevin Trenholm.

“But it’s only a big number if you compare it to the amounts of carbon dioxide we’re putting into the atmosphere,”

“If you compare it to the amount of emissions we have already caused, it’s still a small one. But if you take into account how much it’s already emitted, we’re looking at a little over 10 billion tonnes”

“But it’s only a matter of time, it’s only a matter of time.”

Professor Trenholm’s comments were echoed by the Australian Law Reform Commission’s chief climate scientist, Professor Greg Hunt.

“People have been lulled into a false sense of security by a combination of a booming coal industry and a general climate that is generally unfriendly,” Professor Hunt said.

“It’s a climate issue. Climate change is real, we’ve all worrying about it, but that doesn’t mean we can’t make some efforts to reduce it”

“Like, the only people who actually care about this issue are the climate hawks, so we need to be better than that.”

Exclusive Footage:’s Unnatural Motives To Hate Latinos Revealed

As the deportation of unaccompanied children in the United States has become a divisive issue, a prominent advocacy group has released a new video outlining their arguments.

The Latino Victory Fund released a compilation of their opinions as a single, while a separate Facebook page explains how they will be taking down the controversial messages.

The video, which has garnered 700 likes on Facebook, makes for disturbing viewing.

From the opening moments, the group’s founders, Robert and Michelle Rodriguez, insist that they are well-founded in their racist opinions.

“If we say we hate Latinos and Latinos, that means we are Latino, just like it was always intended,” they begin the video with.

“But we have a different way to think about them, and that’s what really scares the snot-nosed, thinking-man-jokes out there who’ve been stalking our Facebook page,” they continued, before showing a clip of a Latino man being sexually violated by American soldiers.

“Mate, they wouldn’t understand,” said Michelle.

“We just want them out of here.”

The video ends with an emotional Michelle taking a knee while the Latino community weeps on the U.S.-Mexico border.

“We have families here. And Latinos aren’t family. They are murderers, rapists and drug dealers,” she says.

“We are Latinos, and we are leaving.”

Trialist Behaving Like A Class Clown Gets His Start In The Arts

TEXT:

Just like he’s there, on the opposite side of the barista millenium, a young woman is looking to learn more about their profession.

That’s according to some of her classmates.

Casey Mosshart, the apprentice fencer at the the Colenso Bistro on O’Connell Street in Betoota Grove, explained to The Advocate that she was initially thinking of entering the Bachelor Of Arts program but wasn’t comfortable with the discipline required.

Then she realised there’s already a degree in a barista apprentice program in the Arts.

“I wanted to go into the Whooton Academy for a certain reason,” she said.

“But as I was saying, there’s a school in the Arts right next door. The college is lovely, too. So I went to The Whooton Academy and became a student of the Master Barista apprentice program,”

“So I’ve spent a bit of time learning how to be a barista. What I was really struggling with was learning the proper barista etiquette. I learnt a lot but that’s another story. I think I’ll just have to go back to the Whooton academy after my second year.”

According to Mosshart, she’s already got a head start in her training because she’s already spent a few months at the Masters Barista Training Centre in Betoota Grove.

Speaking to The Advocate earlier today, Casey said she plans to head down to Brisbane when her training at the Whooton Academy ends and spend some time with her old school friends.

“Oh yeah, I’ll be down there for a few months, yeah. I’ll get into the barber chair, learn the proper etiquette for a barista and then I’ll head down to the Sydney Training Centre, learn the proper barista etiquette and then head down to the Royal and learn the modern art of barista,” she said.

“You’d have to be really keen to be a barista apprentice at the Tardis. You’d have to be really bad at it to apprentice at the Tardis. There’s plenty of bad coffee in the world but the Tardis is the toughest,”

“The Bachelor obviously doesn’t count.”

Labor Chalked Up $2M Loss To Having Ryan Farrugia On Staff

TEXT:

Senior Labor figures were branded collateral damage yesterday by the NSW Labor Party after the leader was charged for fraud over his use of a government vehicle.

John Singleton, the leader of the party was seen earlier yesterday in a Blackabag and ear pierced by the horns, was made aware of the loss by a number of senior colleagues.

“I was on the dumper this morning when the boss had the police pump me full of choccies” said a close ally.

“He pulled up outside my garage and seized my Lexus in his steed. He said, ‘Where ya going, you worthless bumbag?’ and I said, ‘Fuck off you useless cunts’ and he pulled out a pair of handcuffs”

The party was advised to immediately sack the man by his two year term. However, the party would not have to sack Mr Farrugia – only the stripping of his rights to be a minister.

The arrest comes as Labor faces another blow after senior figures in the party have admitted the loss in recent weeks.

John Howard, the former Prime Minister and the man most responsible for making the country great and growing the middle class – was also found to have been liable for fraud over his use of a government car.

The charge resulted in a considerable blow to the internal politics of the party, with the leader now to face a maximum of five years in prison for fraudulently taking and use of a government vehicle.

Mr Farrugia, who was referred to as a ‘cash-for-career’ scheme, has had reported a long career in political organising and running independent candidates and is thought to be the first person in Australia to be suspended for fraud and disciplinary offences.

The right-wing group of MPs and Senators are hoping the sensational allegations and the subsequent arrest of the leader of the party, is just the tip of the ice berg.

“He won’t be getting away with this” says the Chief Liberal, John Duckworth.

“He’s just got to show he’s a real community-minded bloke. Otherwise they might keep paying his fine and decide to sack him for a good behaviour bond”

“He’s an Australian first, he’s Australian”

Vale Thong Factory Feels Like You Can’t Change A Grinder Without Re-Enacting Themself

TEXT:

Local woman, Amanda Annison (33) says the production of political correctness has made her feel like she can’t make an adult in a peaceful way, no matter how much the rest of the world censors her words.

Believing that her outspoken opposition to the idea of women who don’t have their own rights and leave the responsibility of their upbringing to the men of their childhood and apply themselves, takes her into a world of power where she doesn’t need to actually argue her points, to earn them.

“Hey, I got half a gun in the end and I don’t like trawlers. So I’ve got the right of it”

When the creators of these political correctness videos think they’re being politically incorrect, Amanda tells the story of how she’s decided to get a gun to defend herself from an ex-cops boyfriend who physically assaulted her when she was a young girl.

“He came at me with a crow bar, only to see me standing there with my gun in my hands. My boyfriend, Jesus. He thought I was being politically incorrect.”

“Then, when I tried to get away with threatening to shoot him with my gun, the story is slightly different. I actually had my hands in his and wasn’t actually threatening to kill him, just to make him aware that I had an outstanding charge for aggravated assault. So, the charges are completely different to how they are to men… I haven’t really spoken to him about it yet.”

With a section of the Thong Factory workers meeting in tears in order to argue the need for the resurgence of these violent workplaces, Gandherding was a fitting reminder of the complexity of the issue by comparison.

Faced With Two History-Filling Performances, Whiteboy Council Puts On White Polo And Gets Away With It

One of the city’s most absent-minded young professionals got away with it today.

24-year-old Carl Costello told The Advocate that his life-long dream of meeting the Queen and going on dates with women has come true – at least for the first time.

“Ever since I turned up to my first open mic last year, I’ve tried to set myself up for this year,” he said.

“A six-week music course, a group chat with a few girls and a fucking deadset in the pool with a girl from the ABC,”

“I mean, if I was with some big name agent or lawyer, it would be a pretty long shot. But I’ve been up to every pub in town and had a few chits. You know how you go when you’re the last drunk in the bar. You go to the last one and your life is over. There’s about four or five places you can get a good night’s sleep in,”

“Like a real friendly with a bit of a boogie, a real good time with a real red light. That alone makes you a very good judge of how you’d go on a date. Not like a night out with a girls usually, I’m a bit mean at home.”

Last year, the unruly 17-year-old was dubbed ‘the only one with the balls to bust the kingdom’ – with a young local girl.

She’s 17,” he said.

“That’s why I’m trying to bust this city like I’m a real member of it. To go the pub. For real. Not like the gangster types. We’ve got the freedom here, just like in New York City. I’m the only one here who can ruin your fucking night out with his words.”

The Advocate reached out to a number of local whiteboys about the unwanted attention and disrespect they have been receiving from the AES and Royal Commission.

“Fuck no thank you! I’m still sleeping in a hotel room in this fucking shithole.” said one young local boy.

“You have a job, mate. That’s why you paid to live here. It’s not a choice to be honest. You know the drill. You join up with the boys and go to work each day for a job.”

Local Man In Hospital After Practice Session Was A Bit Long

TEXT:

Local man, Glenn Palaszczuk, is in hospital this morning after a 24 hour training session at the Betoota Dolphins Leagues Club.

The session, which reportedly cost $300 per hour, was supposed to get Glenn on his way towards being a doctors assistant at our town’s only hospital, but he didn’t.

His family and friends have been paying attention to his well-being this afternoon as a few of the sessions took a little bit longer than expected.

Glenn’s GP, Dr Michelle Constantine, took time out of her busy afternoon of running Glenn’s blood pressure and cholesterol profiles to speak to The Advocate today.

“Yep, Glenn is in hospital,” said Dr Constantine.

“It’s a serious illness, but he’s only a month away from the operation, so we’ll see how he goes,”

“In the meantime, he’s been in the ICU here at Betoota Base Hospital. He has pneumonia and upper respiratory infections, but nothing serious.”

Dr Constantine explained that Glenn is in a stable condition and that he is expected to make a full recovery.

The Advocate reached out to the hospital but received a manning reply hours after the interview with Dr Constantine.

“It’s not good, mate,” said one of Glenn’s old friends, who requested anonymity.

“I’m going to get my junk mail by post and throw it up on a new fan. It’s how you keep it from getting in the mail,”

“Also, he’s got a bad case of the cold sores. I don’t think he’d be able to get a full-time job, I think he’s got a tertiary education in writing. If he did, he’d be on the front page of every newspaper in the country.”

“I mean, the soft hands of Jesus Christ,”

“But yeah, Glenn was a bit hard to get. I don’t think he’s got any scars yet, but he was a bit fresh on the knife. He’s in a good place.”

Man who says how much he loves playing guitar often tells his kids it was for the love of Christ

TEXT:

JOSH MICHEAL JUST got his first guitar at age 5 and, by his late 20s, he was strumming along to all kinds of rock bands – including Alice, Led Zeppelin, The Eagles and The Who.

His older siblings, while not much in the way of a singer, did fall in love with the electric guitar as they developed their own taste in music.

From a young age, JOSH was able to tell his own story – the story of how he was born, the journey that lead him from the back of a borrowed Toyota Landcruiser, through a North Shore Sydney back to the front of a round boomer van.

“I was born on the 60th of May, into a filthy Queenslander stockbroker’s family,” said JOSH to The Advocate in the smoking rain.

“I’ve been blessed to grow into what I’ve been able to. My older brothers and sisters, even, have had a helping hand. They have raised me and given me every opportunity to live a life that is very much in the path of a rockstar career. The only thing that I want is to be a real rockstar.”

But to that end, JOSH is taking aim at what he sees as the biggest threats to his dreams – and how he can leverage his big brother and his rockstar parents into helping him achieve his dreams.

“It’s very simple really. Rock music is dying, and that really makes me sad,” said JOSH.

“These people that really get around the world and make millions of dollars, have very little interest in playing any form of music for any amount of time. They have nothing in their life except getting ripped off by large companies and big movie studios. Rockstar movies, I have absolutely no plans,”

“Also, I’ve been very careful not to go full rockstar on them. I just want to play a little music and make them happy. Rockstar movies, yes.”

World’s Most Violent Morons

TEXT:

THE WORLD’S MOST VIOLENT people, according to the United Nations, live in the Northern Hemisphere and Europe, especially in the United Kingdom.

The most dangerous people in the world are found in places like the Congo, Australia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, northern Mexico and parts of Canada, the United States and Western Africa.

The most violent men and women are found in the United States, Australia, New Zealand and parts of Asia, the United Kingdom, Canada and parts of Africa and North America.

It is believed that these people make up about 10% of the world’s total population of violent, criminal, sicko and degenerate animals.

HOW WELL ARE THEY WELL:

“We are happy to announce that we’ve found a community of good people with great views, great music and great food!” — Mel Gibson

“It’s just a matter of getting our hands on the phone to say, ‘Can you please bring back Lord of the Flies to this country,’ because we need to take the nation’s entertainment system to a higher level.”

When asked if it was easy to find people with a similar mindset to Mel Gibson, the UN youth envoy explained that it’s really hard.

“Unfortunately, I think you mean to say that as a compliment,” he said.

“Unfortunately, I think you are referring to the film, Lord of the Flies, which is based on a book by the same title. It’s really hard to find good people to be in love with that type of shallow, thoughtless dorky old man, like Mel Gibson,”

“The U.S. government has a lot to answer for here. And Mel Gibson is just one of them.”

Duncan Moody Activist Launches New Campaign To Free The Noodle’s

TEXT:

COMMERCIAL noodle enthusiast D.M. Moody has today taken up his cause with a new campaign, beginning with the release of a cookbook this week.

As an avid user of the dessert in his annual treat of tasting, Moody feels it his duty to free the culinary class of his countryman and founding father, Darryl Ramsbottom.

He says it’s an ideal example of an all-inclusive movement.

“I’m launching this new campaign to free the noodle, it’s a big enough deal to warrant its own subreddit,” he said.

“Like, there’s a subreddit for noodles, the biggest ones are named for their plants. Sort of like #Fedora, but I’m launching this one because it’s my taste and I think it’s important.”

“All of you know how much I love my country man, but I think it’s time to take the country boy out of the equation, put him on a more modern pedestal, one that is representative of the country and maybe make him wear a bit more white. Like a young Bruce Springsteen with all of his contradictions.”

Moody then went on to describe how he has every intention of freeing the many different varieties of noodles from Australia and the purity of the dish is paramount.

“The biggest problem with a noodle is that the noodle is too big to eat, which is why it is called a ‘noodle’ by the Australians.”

“For me, it’s the same reason you don’t want to eat your pasta with them, so you get a good sauce and make it even better with your chopsticks.”

Sydney Girl Regrets Having To Have An Abortion At The Last Minute

TEXT:

After a big month of trying to fool her parents into thinking she’s not an emotionally unstable unstable sociopath with a problem with the world, a young Sydney woman has made the decision to have an abortion at the last minute.

After an emotional and difficult conversation with her parents, Megan James decided she’d done enough to receive a termination at 3:01 am last night.

“It’s not worth the risk, I just want to be safe,” explained Megan as her parents made sure to not knock on the door asking if there was a baby going to be born.

“Also, I want to save my family some embarrassment.”

Despite being offered several different options, including being put in a position where they have to pay for her to have the procedure done, Megan opted for the cheapest one, which involved cutting her wrists and her Mum making it clear that she will not pay until she has had the baby.

“As a final option, I got her an abortion for the happiness of being able to be with God,” explained the young mother who was excited about the thought of being able to say she had the choice to have an abortion over the birth of her child.

Ms. James told her parents that she had been considering her options and it’s ‘fine’ to have the abortion but knew she’d have to have it now that she thought she was almost certainly going to have it anyway.

“My parents told me that I won’t be able to pay and I could either have the operation done now or pay. Not both,” she said.

“So I’m thinking about getting an organ from someone who’s going to die, then I’ll do the fucking operation now.”

Turnbull Says Tensions Between Nauru and Nauru Are Fucking That High

TEXT:

The Prime Minister has returned to Canberra today, just hours after the two countries signed a $444 million deal to resettle 160 refugees in Australia.

Just 72 hours after Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull promised to take every single Australian who is currently stuck on Nauru, including children. that are in the Pacific nation, and sending them to our nation’s processing centres in Bali – The Coalition Government has finally agreed to send the first refugees over.

This comes as tensions between Nauru and Nauru continue to tear the island apart.

The deal was also heavily criticised by the opposition, who say that asylum seekers, who are not asylum seekers at all, will be just as well off if we send them directly to a third-world prison camp where they will spend the rest of their lives trying to feed on a diet made out of excretions and dead rats.

The agreement was also widely criticised by the new Australian Nationals leader Scott Morrison MP, who said Australia is opening new Australian detention centres on the island nation.

“We won’t be doing that at our own expense”

“This is what we did in 2013 when we opened a prison camp on Nauru and a separate detention facility on Manus Island”

“That was all part of the plan, as well. But it was also because the Australian public were left to make the hard choice to either take the heat off their air-conditioned during winter or risk being killed by ice caps that freeze at the bottom of the month”

“I’m not a lion!”

The bill comes after the Prime Minister yesterday officially signed the deal, ending a lengthy and complicated attempt by both the Federal and State governments to put forward a single, coherent argument for why sending these people to Australian shores is in the best interest of our most vulnerable.

Brisbane Hipsters Scull To 3:20pm After Latest Full Moon In The City

TEXT:

Brisbaneites have been lining up in at the public bar for nearly two hours now, waiting for the latest moonlight stargazing event in the big smoke.

What started off as just a couple of whispers to close friends and family in the Springs has turned into an all out wait for the Big Night.

Which is coming up this weekend.

Speaking to The Advocate this morning, local hipster and former hipster, Jesse Carver-Davis said he got the ticket to this shit show at the Old City District train station at 6:30pm on Thursday night.

“It’s an all-inclusive show, you know what I mean? They pay for everything, the bathrooms, the airconditioning, the houses. You name it. You can come and pay as much as you want,” he said.

“We pay to be on the streets and no one is looking. It’s like nothing, I guess. But it’s a very interesting way to spend a cold Sunday afternoon in the Old City,”

“It’s a real posh way to spend a weekend in Brisbane. I really like how these kids get so worked up about all the blokes wearing suits with cash in their pockets and saying they’re the only ones who matter.”

As an example of how free this city’s hipsters have been of ideology and hard left politics, The Advocate reached out to the Secretariat Club, a branch of The Brotherhood of St Francis, who believe that Brisbane is a jungle city with a general culture of criminality and drug use.

Relying on The Advocate’s original article as their source, our reporters spoke to Johnny (32) of the Boys Royal Club about the idea of waiting until midnight to get into a nightclub.

“You should’ve seen the cunt,” he said.

“When I was twenty-five, he was getting in a cab every night for a good portion of the time. A man in that state is practically broke. He lost a grand and a large amount of money, too. I would’ve gone with a cab if I could’ve been bothered,”

“But I was with a guy that got in a cab every night for twenty years and when he left the club at 8pm, we weren’t even there. Never mind. Fuck that place. Cunt, it’s fucking stupid. It’s fucking gay. You’ll have to wait until Monday to see if I’m not off to a club.”

Our reporters contacted the Publican’s League and the Steakhouse over the weekend and they both seemed to agree with Johnny.

However, the Herald Sun decided to jump the gun and publish an article written by one of our reporters with a slightly different intent.

We reached out to the editor of The Steakhouse and former Sunday Times employee, Clancy Overell, who said he’d never been in a situation where he had to choose between two jobs.

“You know, in those old newspapers that line the inside of the club and call it the bar, you have to balance the whole thing out,” he said.

“With the publishers and photographers always looking over their shoulder, you’d never know where you’d be and that’s what Clancy does in each of those jobs. He’s one of them. So if you’re reading this, now we’re out of here.”

The ideas didn’t all mesh perfectly, however.

“But I got a good idea for Mum’s tea,” said Joyce.

“How about this one, a little bit different to the others. This one, for example, I think, is a little bit bit more creamy than the others. Has people tried it? I don’t think they’ve but I’m going to give it a go.”

Local Muslim Feeling Proud To Be A Muslim After Annoying No One For 10 Years

TEXT:

Mum of 4 is feeling a bit chuffed this morning after the recent survey results that show the Muslim population is growing exponentially.

Coupled with this, young women from the local Muslim community are really enjoying their new found privilege.

Local Woman, Shaima (28) says after her daughter’s footy match with the Aboriginal girls this weekend, she can see why people are so upset with her husband.

“It’s really tough”

“They’re mostly black, white and Asian… and they still give us an earful each Sunday”

“So I decided to become a Muslim so my kids and my Mum would be able to have some decent childcare if they didn’t have to go to an all-girls school. So it’s a good thing for all of us”

Sighing while wiping the sweat off her face, Mum says in case you haven’t heard, it’s really tough being a white mum these days.

“I mean, I’m just a white mum…”

“The whole thing with them, me being a white mum… No wonder they don’t think I look good”

While being a Muslim is great, Mum says it’s just not for her.

“I mean, I used to be a pretty good Muslim… My son would have done well at university and probably would have been doing quite well in his position,”

“But I guess I am a white mum… Even though I am Muslim,”

Mum says that she was doing it tough as a white mum during her son’s first year of secondary education.

“It was tough being a white mum at university. They didn’t even let us get a room in the accommodation for white students”

Rugby Australia’s Technical Committee will explore other options for Colin Kaport’s St. Johns Arms will he missed in round 15

TEXT:

The board of rugby union’s Technical Committee have thrown caution to the wind today by announcing that they’ll examine other options for St. Johns Arms missing in round 15.

“It is very likely that he has a broken tibia, fibula and maxillary bone,” the board wrote in a letter to the disappointed players this morning.

“We will, of course, endeavour to bring him round but if he doesn’t, we will ask the D’O to record a professional try and we will then proceed to the next game,” they wrote.

It’s understood by the Australian Rules Football that the St. Johns Arms from round 15 are the only option for players to play in Round 16. The club also confirmed that the club would like to reserve the right to make replacement players for these injured players.

“We understand it’s very difficult to lose a player of the level of these two players,” they wrote.

“But it’s very likely that he has done so and we’ll do our best to help him get back on his feet.”

The letter ends with the club asking fans to pray for the player and his recovery.

NSW Government To Fund New Taxi Industry Without Question

TEXT:

In a shocking twist, the New South Wales Government has today announced the launch of a groundbreaking new program that will make the lives of taxi drivers easier for years to come.

This comes as the state and federal governments today confirm that the companies will not need to contribute towards their existing taxi industries, or fund them anyway.

This decision comes after months of consultation and discussion, with the community, taxi owners and taxi drivers all voicing their concerns about the issue.

In NSW, taxi licence owners and taxi drivers have been calling for years for the state and federal governments to provide greater funding for their existing industries, to be released from their current, paltry, levels.

However, the NSW Government has today announced the launch of a program that will make their lives much easier.

“We just want to make it clear, the only people that will get their hands on these new government funded limousines are the rich old white people that drive them” said Premier Gladys Berejiklian.

“And that’s it. No more young people getting their hands on them. It’s like a company car – they’re just going to disappear with the car”

The Premier was then quickly cut off, by the opposition leader John Robertson, who asked her to please ‘cut to the chase’ – he’s been campaigning for a levy on drivers to be introduced, along with the new tax-free ride-sharing company.

“Just let us and our young people do this” said the Premier.

“We are the biggest drivers of taxis in NSW anyway. I don’t care what you do, we have to feed our children and our elderly, you know. So please don’t come after us with a barrage of suits”

Mr Robertson then asked if the Queensland Government would be supporting the idea.

“Yeah I’ll do that” he laughed, before reminding his colleagues that Queensland needs them.

Man Jealous Of Wife’s Pleasure Having Mate Withdraw Three Times From The Conversation

A local Melbourne man has had an absolutely magnificent seventy minute of an afternoon sitting with his smartphone in front of him.

The new-found interest in the world of mobile phone technology has lead Mark Chen (28) to his third major withdrawal from a phone conversation with his first three parties in the last two days.

Mark, a junior business consultant at Gosford-based Diamantina Agency in Melbourne’s inner suburbs, says he has been having a sad time lately.

“Me and my sister went over to West End for the last time to visit some old friends a couple of weeks ago”

“We just sort of sat there watching the world go by.”

“The other two parties had a good time, if you know what I mean.”

Mark then spent the next 45 minutes in a deep thought period, unsure if he is paying for the ‘overheating’ of his phone, and then the clinking of his glasses and drinking tea.

“So I started thinking about my sister, and how she was like my sister.”

“Why wasn’t her name Kati?”

“Yeah look, I’ve got a few mates who are top tier” he said.

“A few that are pretty good at cricket too,”

The 25-year-old now best known for his role in the cricket-centric movie ‘Crash’ told The Advocate that he’s decided to burst into the national cricket scene this summer.

“I mean, it’s just pretty dope to live on the edge. You never know what you’re going to get into, once you get the girl out of the house”

“I’ve just taken a week off and joined the army,” he said.

“I was up in the Maranoa last night watching some cricket in the smoking pokies and I was finally down in the pits with the boys – we just didn’t have time to talk about what we were doing,”

“Then I heard this weird yelping noise and I realised I was home. So, yeah, I got the boys to get their spring boots on, get their helmets on, get their coats and leave – it’s ok. We got the skips on, did the triples in the car park and found some kava for the kids to have at home.”

It’s believed Shane was only planning to live a week in the Republic before he started working out of home in St Kilda, until he got to work at a local training facility on a Saturday afternoon.

“We had a good laugh about it though. As we were leaving home on the 15th, Shane got the boy to ‘jump in a few tickets’,” he said.

“I think it’s just a bit bit too revealing that he has done it on the 15th, you know?”

“It’s about as close to a sign as you can get without getting a speeding fine!”

Two Independent Librarians Form Niche Christian Party

TEXT:

Two formerly close friends, a religious and a career litigator, have formed a new niche Christian party – one that you probably wouldn’t know existed if they told you.

The two men, who are known locally by their nominally Christian organisations, Holy Orders of St. Jude and St Jude – gave The Advocate the go-ahead to publish their candid accounts of what they did on this godforsaken morning.

The duo have worked their way up through the ranks of the far-right Christian lobby and became the founding members of a branch of the main Australian Christian lobby, the Southern Cross’s Association Of St Jude, a branch of the state-based organisation responsible for the ‘National Secular Society’ logo.

At the age of 64, Peter Giles and John Mcvety are the third and fourth members of the party and run the party in the nation’s biggest states – and they’ve just signed a deal with the NSW Farmers Federation – one of the largest voluntary organisations in the country.

In fact, the two men’s political views don’t differ very much from the majority of Australia’s population – they both live in a suburb of a county with the same Queen of England, Mary.

They’ve also apparently been the first to admit that their two homes are on opposite sides of the hill.

The Advocate spoke to a number of the former friends in the wake of their separation.

One of the people who helped John, who grew up in Betoota’s Christian cross-party, got an up close and personal with what it feels like to be on the wrong side of the political spectrum.

“You know, it’s hard being the lefty in a suburb full of leftys, it’s really fucking hard,” said the once-popular public servant.

“So I thought to myself, if I was a gent, you know, I would vote for the Liberal Party because it’s the only party that seems to make sense for me, and I like being on the left. But Jesus, my grandmother said I was wrong. So did my grandfather. He’s one of those guys that says he’s “against the system,” but he’s always voted Liberal,”

“I mean, he’s a Roman Catholic. It’s hard to be a Catholic in the city. God, I need to be the first to admit that. I’m the lefty, but I’m not sure where I stand.”

The Advocate reached out to Peter Giles’ wife for comment but he was too busy being a fuckin’ lefty to come pick one up for us.

John Mcvety’s wife of 25 years, Mary, was kind enough to answer a few questions regarding her husband’s views on the various personalities and theocratic tendencies in the world today.

“I’m pretty much the last of a line of three,” she said.

“But while we’re both right-wing, I’m not a Catholic, so fuck that,”

“As for my husband’s views on gay people, I’ve known him for quite some time and he’s a pretty much the last Catholic in the country,”

“Yeah, but fuck that, it’s not like we’re going to be having sex anytime soon. It’s like the old days when you’d have single women hanging off you like they’d be from the dead,”

“He’s also a big supporter of climate change. I’ll never really come to terms with him touching the sensitive parts of my skin,”

“He’s also a big supporter of gay marriage. I’ll never really get to know him when he’s not having sex with me,”

How To Get Rid Of A Boom In Your Cornwall With A Convenient Signal

TEXT:

A local crockie on the Gold Coast is today receiving some significant praise after he rolled out a system of over 12 discreet signal sources from around the house.

20-year-old man, Angus Spudland, says this kind of signal management is actually the quickest way to keep your neighbours and co-workers onside, when you have your neighbours and co-workers onside.

“So basically, there’s three tiers of signals, all very discreet, so they won’t notice you using them”

“You can start with the most obvious signal, which is the flashing yellow lights, the sign for the neighbour’s gym, and then you can progress up to the blue lights in your garage”

“Sometimes you’ll even find a flashing red traffic light coming out of the driveway, but not for long”

However, Angus says that even though he has a license plate with this kind of trunk light, he knows better than to use it as a deterrent.

“You’ve got people like me who are just trying to have a laugh, who don’t really care about what you do, and don’t really know why you do it, and the fact that it’s there is enough evidence to charge you with driving whilst intoxicated… I’d much prefer to use something like a wind alarm, that way I can see where the people are coming from”

“Or an inflatable skyhook, that way I know they’re coming from”

Sunburnt Grad who’s used to getting sunburnt says Labor will never understand

AFTER A SERIOUS FALL FROM GROUND:

A SUNBURNT AS A 67-YEAR-OLD MEN is calling for Labor to be impeached because the party he joined twenty years ago, has never been able to grasp a more pressing issue – the fragility of the Australian economy.

George Christensen is referring to a recent report by the CSIRO that predicts average Australians will be worse off over the next 50 years unless drastic action is taken to stabilise the global economy.

The horrific predictions come from a report which warns Australia will be worse off under Labor than it was under the Howard Government.

The Advocate reached out to Mr Christensen a short time ago, where he said Labor has no idea what the ALP platform is.

“They just say ‘we’re going to build more hospitals and roads’… Don’t give me that glib and opportunistic right wing bullshit. They don’t even believe in climate change, believe me. That’s my opinion,” he said.

“They’ll never be able to tell me how bad things are, or stop  the global warming. It’s all going to be up to me, my vote and what I tell them.”

Mr Christensen then went on to give a laundry list of his top issues.

“But no matter what I do, no matter what ALP policy I adopt, the global economy will not be able to withstand the rapid population growth that comes with more than one election. It’s just too much to handle.”

“It’s like the Libs want us to grow faster or something. Or the Greens want us to grow faster. Now the problem is that I’m going to have to vote Liberal because I’m too old to have any qualms about voting for a bunch of child molesters and fantasists that are just out to get me.”

Hugger Tells Sydney Neighbours That He’s Kind Of An Idiot For Not Blowing Into A Private Box

Although New South Wales was established as a separate state, the Australian state of Origin team has been dubbed the ‘Aussie Hounds of Destiny’ – with most of the best players in the nation travelling to Sydney to play the State Of Origin.

The New South Wales football team plays its home games in Sydney, with the Origin teams playing a variety of games around the nation – as well as a number of international matches.

However, for players like Kurtley Beale, who spends most of his time in the smoking section of one of the city’s most iconic nightclubs, there is no excuse for not blowing into a private box – in accordance with the local club rules.

“I’m not blowing into one of those stupid fucking private box clubs, like all these tourists come down here and tell us what to do. We can’t do it,” laughed the former high school teacher and youth football team captain.

“I mean, we’ve got a government club. There’s a lot more rules, I don’t care what you all up to, if you’re not on the piss and getting on the wrong side of a mate in a private box, you can’t play,” said Beale who’s never played in a private box.

However, Beale’s side-piece, Jakey Nankai, has since come to light that he’s actually a bit of a loser.

The oft-injured fullback has informed club officials that he thinks he’s a real winner, after Canberra, who paid $3 million for him last year, handed him a one-year extension, worth $4 million if he’s the type of bloke who doesn’t mind drinking with him, while he’s also in a public drinking area.

“Yeah, that’s the sort of fuckin’ loser you’d call. It’d be hard to play with those real winnings,” said Beale.

“Fucking Chinese lotus fuckhead is one of those real winners. One of the most important people in this game,”

“I could go on and on for hours about it, but this is just the start of it.”

However, when asked what his ideal game is, Beale replied that he’s gotta be tough.

“Yeah, but seriously. Tough cunt who blows into a private box, known for doing shit like that. Tough cunt who blows into a private box, known for blowing into a private box, known for doing shit like that, but I’m gonna play him in a really hard shoulder press,” he said.

“That’s the hard fucking job. So yeah, you’d be right if I said I’m a fuckin’ loser. Fuckin’ loser.”

“What Is This Shit?” Asks Dad

TEXT:

With just under three months to go in the 2018 NRL season, dad isn’t taking his eyes off the league’s biggest hot news story of the week – and that’s rugby league.

“What is this shit?” asked the exasperated dad in reply to a question that the kids have been bouncing off him for hours.

Moments after the dad’s exasperated rant about rugby league, kids start arriving at the party and following their dad out onto the deck.

Only after they’re done does mum get the first clue that this was a race to the bottom, as her son, Connor, dropped into the bin.

“Who is this kid?” she asks.

“Connor? Connor? Connor? Connor? Connor? Connor? Connor? Connor? Connor? Connor? Connor? Connor? Connor? Connor? Connor? Connor? Connor? Connor? Connor? Connor? Connor? Connor? Connor? Connor?

Heartbroken Ex-Con From Mates Chased Off To Red Mountain For 3 Days

TEXT:

JK Rowling has come under fire this week for the ‘disgusting’ photo that has been making the rounds of social media this week, but has defended her decision to publish it.

The photo, which has since been deleted, shows the iconic character of Tom Riddle looking out the back window of a pub after he was chased from his farm at the start of the week.

Many political commentators have called for the writer to be “buried” this week, calling it the most appropriate time to publish the image – which many experts say has caused quite a stir in his own circles.

However, a number of community leaders have hit back at the criticism, saying that the image speaks for itself.

Local Betoota area man, Fergus Bradshaw, said that he first saw the image online and thought it was pretty crook, but after reading through the article by Newsweek, he came to the conclusion that the image was a result of one of their many scandals.

“What I saw on the internet this morning is a heartwarming illustration of a young man trying to live a life that no one else does,” he said.

“A young man chasing his dreams, a young man chasing his dreams – that’s my own story,”

“Of course it’s not true. I didn’t become a writer because I wanted to write about the inner lives of people who don’t care about going to university and about people who don’t like animals. I’m not one of them. But the truth is that Tom Riddle does have a lot of friends who do care about animals and the sanctity of their beautiful countryside. But that doesn’t mean he’s going to give up his dreams of being Tom Riddle,”

“Tom has friends of friends. He’s a true fan of his own.”

Faux-Horn-Band-Wearing Coworker Gives Her Opinions On Local Issues

TEXT:

As Australians tend to do, Julia Pearson’s opinions on local issues are completely at odds with those of her political cohort.

The far-right wing, quasi-fascist politics expert has gone from voice to voice today, with her future of the nation’s public servants in her crosshairs.

This has resulted in a number of detractors not being able to get her opinion on local issues because their political communities wouldn’t accept that they even exist.

“I don’t care about what anyone else thinks, I’m here to tell you my truth,” the 30-year-old’s closer said to one of our reporters as she made a beeline for the nearest føtex outlet.

“If you ask me, you’d be a bit better off if you got a pair of Feta Puffs and a McFlurry,” she said in a conspiratorial tone.

“Do you know how convenient it is for every Australian to walk around with nothing but a pair of oversized Abercrombie & Fitch button-downs?”

“It’s a great time to be alive.”

Our reporter then asked Julia about all the negative press the federal government has taken away from the harsh realities of this century.

She said it’s not worth it.

“What’s stopping me from getting a two-by-two-foot-large-to-peach-basket-on-the-lake with a giant stack of unprocessed plastic coffeemaker paper towels inside? What’s stopping me from getting a suit and a pair of tailored suits and a blanket in each?”

“There’s a very real possibility that in the next 10 years, a country of 500,000 people may look like a quiet place.”

Popular Hotel In Northern NSW To Continue ‘Jumping The Fuck Out’ Or Be Named Neddy’

TEXT:

Neddy Hotel in the Hunter Region is to remain the same name, despite being renamed by one of its owners.

Popular wholesaler JB Hurls first thought he’d have a crack at the club, after his 8-year-old daughter, Delilah, told him that her mother ‘grew up in a rough neighbourhood’ – which was in turn confirmed by his more recent inspection of the house, which was listed as being in poor financial health by the NSW State Government – as is the case with almost all property sold from October 2015 through June 2016 by private developers.

The most recent inspection by NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian and NSW State Government was performed by the Landcare Estate Agents Association, or LEAF, after the property reached “extraordinary” state.

The Premier’s announcement of the name change has been met with widespread groaning and rolling of the eyes – though the owner has defended it, saying that his family ‘had a rough patch’ before the name was put on the place.

“It’s always been called the Lost Hotel,” said the owner, Peter Zappoli.

“The original hotel was quite dreary. There was a lot of dust in the ceilings and in the walls. We had a really rough patch after the new construction started. Then, just when I thought I was getting close to tears, I thought the old hotel had a bit more character – but I was wrong. The hotel is a bit like a surf club,”

“It’s full of curious elderly men who make it their purpose to tear people off to their absolute core. I get that they do it for the money, but I’ve no sympathy with their attitude. This is just the honest truth of the matter.”

Mr Zappoli then offered to give an interview to The Advocate, but said he’d leave it to his daughter to decide whether or not she wants to come and get him.

Australia Faces Crumbling On Line Of Responsibility After Demanding Snow From Northern Territories

TEXT:

The entire country is today facing a possible ticking time bomb in their collective quest for snow.

It has been reported that the snow melt from the Northern Territories has threatened to completely separate the once sparsely-forested and sparsely-populated Australian interior from the rest of the country.

The Daily Telegraph reports that even the entire country’s biggest city, Canberra, can expect to see upwards of a metre of snow over the next few days.

“You shouldn’t expect this much snow north of the Errol... It’s absolutely terrifying” said the nation’s peak scientific body.

“The ­Northern Territories Snowcap is currently sitting at around 2-3 metres. That’s a lot of snow”

The National Party have also today announced that the remaining heavily trafficked sled dogs in the country will be fully clothed and fed during the next couple of days to prepare them for the huge influx of people coming from the sea.

Former Sydney University School of Economics student now at homeschooled by family

TEXT:

TEACHING FROM HOME is another sport in Australia, a new poll has found.

From baseball to rugby, popularity is almost universal amongst those who’ve never left their comfort zone.

For a time it was the way to go.

Not long after the second grade commenced at South Sydney in 1993, the co-workers of a lively, vibrant and vibrant society started putting their coats and hats on in the shade – and setting up their fancy chairs outside the closed door cricket club.

It was then that Glen Henderson’s work with young people took off, he says.

“I was the guy who played first grade for the biggest club in Sydney,” he told The Advocate.

“After three years at South Sydney, they gave me a chance to try my hand at this burgeoning industry,” he explained.

“One thing lead to another,” Glen said the co-worker to the bewilder as she looked at the carpet and sandstone ceilings.

“I thought, why the hell not? I’ll just go ham on the bosses for some drugs,” Glen said.

“Then they gave me this horrible job,” he explained.

“They told me I’d have to be born in their home town to get the money and that no community in this country is as accepting of gay people as Melbourne and Canberra. So I did what my Dad told me to and came back. All this took about a year,”

“Then they told me that if I wanted to keep working as an anthropologist at a major Sydney institution, I had to be born into the family and be a member of their religious community,” Glen said.

“I was born that way.”

Glamorous locals, who have their own attractions in the country, say they’d love a big job and big rewards, but Glen’s suggestion that it is ‘unlikely’ that he’d want to return to Sydney within the next five years is something that unsettles many.

Our reporter reached out to Glen’s parents, a man of many talents but perhaps not the ability to raise a child who can build a wind turbine in a single season.

But, as most people born into the Lower North Shore of Sydney have learnt, Glen was born into the wrong part of the family.

Glen’s parents, Antony and Margaret Ponds, have a nice house on Bletchly Ln in the South Betoota Ponds. Like many country towns, the town has had a slow decline due to the residents simply not wanting to have to work hard for it.

“It’s a shame, Glen” said the former farming property’s namesake, Angela.

“The Ponds, you should’ve seen the farm man over there in the leather in the paddocks. That big boy would’ve won at Oxford over a couple years ago. Not a chance in hell,”

“And he still lives in the house that my dad bought for me on the way out. I’m glad I’m free. I could have been a mechanic or something like that.”

And now, as Glen’s parents sit on the front steps of their five-acre estate, they’re offered a rare glimpse into their grassroots.

“It’s a sad day for us,” said Angela.

“Glen once told me that he hated having to work on the land, he said that if we had any money they’d run a business, but we don’t.”

Local Libertine Surprised Nobody In Canberra Likes Him Anymore

TEXT:

Former Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce, the longest serving member of the Australian Government, is reportedly looking for work in Canberra.

His decision to resign from the Liberal Party, in the wake of a sex scandal that has rocked the entire Government, and has his future in the country at risk, is said to have frustrated many of his colleagues.

The prominent member of the New England Party was unavailable to comment on his recent political jolts, and his future in politics is not thought to be looking much bright.

However, as far as Canberra is concerned, Barnaby Joyce is the real deal.

“I got me the rights to make a sale of my Liberal Party membership” he said.

“I sell the freedom to make a sale.”

“You’ll get them the best spot. You can be honest with a girl you know and trust. I’ve got them in the best house in the best area, if that’s what you’re calling.”

The article then went on to explain the reputation of the coastal, inland and desert regions of New South Wales as the largest trading post-industrial centres in the country.

It’s no secret that the Labor Party is perceived as a bit of a fascist brain drain, due to their firm belief in the need to reduce the size of government, and restrict the powers of the Federal government.

That, and their love of so-called ‘union' politics, the general anti-social, and simply unAustralian behaviour.

It also goes without saying that the Queensland Liberal Party have been obsessed with the idea of banning gays and foreigners for years, just the other side of the political spectrum.

Lebanese Army boys finally get some action

TEXT:

Although the Lebanese-Australian community is feeling the crunch as of late, they still have plenty of time to act.

The hottest of the Summer has already arrived, with more than 70,000 Syrian migrants currently on waiting lists across Australia – it’s almost too hot for even the coolest blokes in town to enjoy the outdoors!

The shocking figures have alarmed the NSW and federal governments, who have suggested that the overstuffed welfare state should be more focussed on the young families currently fleeing war and instability in their home countries.

But the young residents of Perth haven’t let that dissuade them, with more than 27,000 Syrian migrants currently on waiting lists across the country, and a growing number of restive Iraqi migrants on the same.

“We’ve got plenty of time!” said one young Syrian male from Perth, who asked to remain anonymous.

“Right now, I’ve got months until the next work holiday!”

“And next week, I’ve got weeks off to see family in the Gold Coast!”

Another young resident of the suburb where the current Labor Prime Minister, Bill Shorten lives, spoke to The Advocate just a short time ago.

“We’ve got plenty of time!” they laughed.

“Ruck out the door, get a job in finance, work at a baron at our local pub and then come home! You fucking bought yourself a new apartment in our suburb, you wank-stomping loser!”

“Fucking go home and work until you’re 60, then you’ll be a farmer, then you’ll be a baron in Melbourne, don’t you reckon?”

The Betoota Hotel is also home to an exclusive Sydney-based Lebanese community, known as the Old City district.

The Lebanese community is known for their heavy security and a generous social life, as well as being very safe.

A senior member of the Lebanese community told The Advocate that it’s very difficult to get a good feel on the area where they live, but they’d be very grateful for any help.

“You know how we live,” he said.

“That’s why we live in the desert. We don’t have a great feel over here, and the first thing we do when we start living in Betoota is we start cutting down trees,”

“We’ve got a good social life here, but we need a place where we can get our heavy stuff out of the way. We’re a tough community, but we need your help.”

Local Incoherent GF Drones Clicking Video To Retrace His Steps

TEXT:

A local woman has stumbled across a surprisingly rich and interesting world of internet harassment during her time at university. 

As a member of the network of website administrators and content creators, Nichelle Pichot worked closely with some of the country’s most talented young people – some of which she’d never met before.

“It was an amazing way to catch up with some of the old friends you might miss” she said.

“It was like meeting someone you’ve never heard of, but know very, very well”

“There were some who were just bonkers and some who were really hot”

The 29-year-old science major is the creator of the “WTF” Facebook page, a page that allows people to write off the entire internet as being a “fictitious utopia”.

“It’s a bit like some sort of government sponsored propaganda, you know what I mean?” she said.

“There was a few things about the internet that made me want to cut the fence and go through the fence”

After a few weeks of investigation, Nichelle and her team of investigators have been able to track down over 1000 comments that suggest an amazing number of people who were “unconnected” to the internet in the first place.

“It was like, like something out of a David and Goliath battle” she said.

“We have more than just one man who’s comments are pretty much like ‘What’s the fucking go?””

This has led the team to believe that there may be hundreds of “unconnected” people.

The comments were mostly run by people who were friends with someone, but were unfriended by their LinkedIn profile or Facebook page.

“We believe that these people are similar to the unconnected people we have found. Like they aren’t really connected to the internet at all” said one researcher.

“They were just like people we found disconnected at work years ago”

“They just had one set of comments and one job that asked to change to a different working space, but are no longer connected to that network”

“The fact that they’re still connected to this network the only thing that really matters is that they care about their friends and family, it doesn’t mean that they actually want to change it”

“How Much Does A Dubbed ‘Davo’ Mean To Him?”

TEXT:

In the wake of a racist attack on a predominantly black community in Brisbane, young Brisbane man Tommy ‘Doc’ Merrett has taken the time to ponder upon the meaning of a dubbed ‘Davo’.

“Mate, it’s fucking bullshit. To me it doesn’t even make sense” he said, while in Brisbane with his mate.

“It’s just a bunch of fucking words with no meaning, like some sort of slogan for some giant company, but to me it means nothing at all. Like, do you know what a Dubbed Davo means to an Australian?”

Doc, who still lives at home in a dusty part of Brisbane’s Old City District, says he first became aware of the word’s derogatory connotations when he was in Sydney during his first semester of tertiary education at the University of Sydney.

“When they [Queensland] banned our club from the Cricket Ground, it meant my place of study and everything I was doing after I got out of Uni could be in jeopardy. So Dubbed Davo, I guess I was pretty much out of the country,” he said.

“That was back in the 90s, I think. Anyway, I got a job at SBS… And they kept calling us that, so I thought ‘Davo’ is a bit off.”

“But then I heard it in the news. A local racist was stabbed to death outside a pub in Brisbane. The police said he was acting in self-defence, which was weird because that guy’s name is Peter. Anyway, there I was.”

Campus Reform: Students, faculty united in their efforts to oppress Australian values

TEXT:

ACTIVISTS AND STUDENTS from all walks of life have rallied together this morning in Sydney to fight for the right to protest, a day after the City of Sydney launched their strict lock out laws.

This follows news that the NSW Government has abandoned a plan to spend almost $1bn over five years on new inner-city transport projects, despite clear evidence that the citizens of Sydney are demanding action.

In addition to this, other left-wing groups have called for the ABC to be wound down as well.

There was some controversy surrounding the project, the central role the Catholic Church played in his ouster, and the notion that people who make fun of the crucifix should be jailed.

However, with the wind in the sails of the student protestors this morning, a group of high schoolers from nearby Byron spent a few minutes talking to The Advocate before they left.

Speaking to the media this morning at a popular central-west university, a group of students said that they wouldn’t be protesting the sexual deviancy that occurs inside a person – and that anyone who opposes the idea of tasering children for more than two hours should be prosecuted to the fullest of the law.

JOSH THOMAS (26) said he’d be protesting the trivialisation of the concept of child abuse – as well as the blatant corporate power he’s been exposed to over his two decades in the industry.

“The idea that being raised in a Christian home will make you soft in the knees is something that needs to be exposed for what it is,” he said.

“Why does everyone hate Christian businesses and institutions? Why does everybody think that only Christians can have a problem with being bullied in the playground? How can you believe that the culture of Jesus is so against bullying?”

Another vocal opponent of the lock out laws was ST GEORGE, a history teacher at the Royal South Sydney Academy of Education.

He’s currently heading up a campaign for a change to the curriculums to remove references to the crucifixion and Holy Scriptures.

“Christian business can’t have it all. Even the local pharma should be criticised and shamed for being a denier of teaching children that Jesus was a white male? That’s what Christianity should be about,” he said.

“If you know what I’m saying, I’m a lifelong Christian. I’m also a teacher. I’m in a position to comment on your previous sentence.”

1st-Year Yoga Instructor At Joyce Park A Bit Kinky

TEXT:

1st-year yoga instructor at the Joyce Park fitness centre, Kevin, is now in a bit of trouble – due to his frequent trips to the local nightclubs and how hard he has gotten on the belly button.

After a few tense and uncomfortable sessions, the only thing missing from Joyce Park Yoga is a pub quiz from Dave Tate from the Channel Country Cricket.

As Kevin is not very good at maths and English, it is believed that his approach to teaching yoga is a bit bit off.

But that hasn’t stopped the tabloids from pounding him for it – leading many to believe that he’s a bit off his head.

“It doesn’t really matter, but I am a bit kinky,” he says.

“I really like doing abs and doing sit ups but the weekends I like to do the former and go swimming. Do you know how dangerous that is?”

With the rise in popularity of a Thai Meditation based alternative to western medicine in recent years, the Joyce Park Yoga Centre has seen a spike in local business since it’s establishment.

“There are quite a few westerners that come in for these abs,” says Mr. Tate.

“Not just the locals, but every day bikies and their backs-up,”

“Some people even come in for ‘a night out in the park’ for $50 dollars. I don’t get it. Why western people love this type of thing. We need to be doing traditional Aussie things like swimming in the park, doing sit ups in the gazebo,  trying to find ways to see our local beauty – and that’s just not a good look,”

“Yoga should be Aussie!”

John Howard Sends Sending Of Pleasure Rocket Inside Australia To Blow The Spirit In Canberra

TEXT:

Veterans of both sides of politics have today taken to social media to thank Howard for allowing them to cast their ballot for the final member of the Coalition. 

The suicide of Australia’s first female Prime Minister in 1996, and subsequent assassination of the entire party, was an emotional and monumental milestone in modern Australian politics. 

Today’s news, however, could see the rocket being launched directly into Canberra, into the hearts of the liberals. 

This comes as both sides of politics in Australia begin to wake up to themselves and to the fact that they might be headed towards a third consecutive election loss in a half measure. 

The Prime Minister’s pleas for protection of those "in need of protection" came not even a month after they were told to buy the next three months of subscription until they become aware of the danger they are all going to face should this attack materialise as expected. 

“I do not forgive Canberra,” Howard said. 

“I will give them the benefit of the doubt until they are confident they will win the next election without Liberal support.” 

The rockets were launched from the Sydney FC locker room at 8:00pm this morning. 

The Prime Minister spoke to The Advocate shortly after, telling us he had no idea where he’d landed.

“Yeah, I know it’s my office so I don’t think there’s anything wrong with me doing it, but yeah, I did land near the White House.”

“But that’s not my secret behind it.”

“Haha, yeah. Fuck you suss.”

“Anyway, yeah, I’ve got some pick-me-up-for-this-week stuff coming up here.”

Following a big season in the NT and the fact that the people of Tasmania have had three years to see progress made towards the two state premierships, Allyson Jones (19), has this week offered a growing community of campers a chance to get on the piss in return for good behaviour.

In a bold experiment, young Alice Mundine has confirmed that she’s seeing a pretty good performance from the 100+ people that have been waiting patiently for months for their chance to watch one of the most well known footballer in the state, Ben Cousins.

“Like, when I started watching him, I could barely get my head around him,” says the local junior.

“He’s the player. That’s my big weekend weekend winner. That’s who I need in my life. You know me, I’m not a loser.”

“Anyway, I’ve been letting some people in the community go while I watch my old pal and the man who got me into the AFL, Shoehorn, win $60 grand at a big race this weekend. That’s what I need to look forward to.”

Last weekend, the transgressive, renaissance-festival type of a race was the Anzac Gallop, a 110km course around a town (village) with an extremely steep hill that typically has to be climbed in order to get to the top.

The race is advertised on the Anzac Peninsula as a weekend race, where you’re encouraged to not stop for the duration of the race as there’s no hotel in sight. However, the best of the best are found at the top, and they’re often sold out before they even get on the road.

Allyson Jones has already managed to tell every resident of her community that she’s the best person in her family, and if that means she’s looking for some goodies, then she should go somewhere else.

Inner-City Leftie Torn Between Keeping The X and Being Exactly Like I Was

TEXT:

A local inner-city leftie has today weighed up the pros and cons of making his inner-city lifestyle permanent and taking on a more relaxed social media presence, with many of his Facebook friends expressing their desire to have him shadowbox his own Instagram account and make a new publicist.

The question of whether or not to start shadowboxing and publicising his whereabouts in advance, also inspired many to go back to their right-wing upbringing on The Agenda Radio and the old school of saying mean things about people like James Pynchon.

Despite his liberal upbringing, Gavin McInnes says he’s left-leaning enough to accept some of the crazy things Donald Trump says and insinuates, like carbon-pollution curbing and asylum seeker policies, but also knows when to step away.

“I’ve just got some ideas of my own” he said.

“There’s a long list of issues that I think should be looked at. Like, we’ve lost our way and our government, which they claim is helping the middle class, is working against us and the working class against them”

“And they’ve failed to provide a pathway for skilled migrants into the country, so what’s the solution? Unless we remove their role in the economy and remove them from elected office, which I don’t think is going to happen, but I’m more inclined to support trying to build a fence and blow money into their pockets,”

“But yeah, that’s something I’m thinking about.”

Office Fury As People Talk About Asking To Be Moved Out Of Office

TEXT:

After a couple of beers, a big misunderstanding about how the office works and a few lefty crumbles, the office became a little bit crowded as the young people began talking about this day that they’ve always wondered about.

The young people didn’t know how to use the Internet, so they stuck to chat rooms that they know full well how to use.

The group all have similar stories about this day, it started with a call to the office kitchen where they were expecting to find some fries but were waiting for the ones outside.

Instead they found some clams.

“Those were the first ones!” said one of the young people.

“I can’t believe that we hadn’t thought about the job before!”

“This is the first day of the week, we were wondering where the fuck we were but we don’t even know where the office kitchen was.”

“Fuck, I only took this job because I wanted to work with the baristas, the librarians, the staff at the coffee shops. I was always better educated than those people and I don’t know what to do with myself. I’ll be back, I’m still doing this!”

The group then made their way to the Internet cafes, where they were met with less and less friendly conversation, it eventually became hard to tell who’s who.

“But I’ve decided, fuck it, I’ll give the job to one of those lads in Melbourne. They’re all ‘dude’s in a box, their full time, their full time and that’s all I need,” said one of the people.

“I don’t care if we piss all the place up. I’ll go to Facebook and say it’s because they’re fucked at life. I’ll write a book.”

Man Who Tried To Get Into Music Business Was Always Odd

TEXT:

Local man, John Bainbridge (34) is not only a talented musician but also a nice enough bloke.

He’s an old soul, but also a classy one.

“I just don’t get what the typical music business is. I think it’s all about signing loads of contracts and getting around with a bunch of lawyers… and there’s not really any of that,”

John says he’s always had a lot of musical taste in his youth, but was always a bit odd.

“I guess I guess I just wanted to get into dance music, but it seems like the only thing I can manage to do is be strange and lippy… and look hot doing it” he says.

This could have something to do with his desire to have a few drinks with all the wrong people, he claims.

“I used to spend so much time in clubs doing the boogie dance. And I used to be an extremely public person, hanging around people in dark rooms and shit… it was weird” he says.

“And then there was this music thing that happened with SoundCloud, where they sort of turned their back on the traditional approach to music publishing, which at the time was basically just like, private jets on fucken Stanley,”

John says he never expected to find himself in the music industry, but it’s a bit strange that every interview is about some new weird thing he’s done.

“I just thought it would be a cool way to spend a weekend away from the real world,” he says.

“But yeah, I guess I’ve got a few odd jobs lined up. You know, I’ll probably end up taking a job at some bikie pub in Betoota’s Old City district. It’s just fucking weird.”

John says he’s always been interested in alternative lifestyles, but never thought he’d find himself in the music industry, and he admits his love for the music business may have something to do with his wanting to be weird.

“Fucking stupid cunt!” – Damo after losing his shit

TEXT:

After a long day of hearing his friend and local casino goons talk shit about the raffle taking place at his local casino, Damo Carpmann was feeling it was time to blow off steam.

“What’s with all these pie punks down at the bar” spat the South Betoota locals man.

“I mean, I think they don’t even work anymore, they’ve all been picked up by some old codgers on a slack job somewhere else. Don’t even get me started on the pin-stripe cut jeans they wear.”

That wasn’t good enough, however, according to the 18-year-old barfly, who’s been following the ‘casino goon’s antics for months.

“It’s weird, it is, but it’s also sick. These fuckin’ pin-striped suits are just the wrong shade of yellow. They just piss me off.” he said.

So in response to these comments, Damo decided to go to the pub with a group of mates, much to the chagrin of the local casino goon.

“Did you come from a real bar?” asked the casino goon, who had the last name of someone else who’s not his family.

“You fuckin’ idiot! I have a real job, damo” retorted the Gen-Y goon.

“There’s also the rent people at the TAB making me pay on top of the real estate market. I’ve never fucking go to these fucking establishments anyway, I’d be in the hands of the vested interests of the casino and the Bank of Mum and Dad.” he said.

“I’m a man of the people.”

Discovery Of Close Range Glove Could Mean Policymakers Are Now Equated With Discovery Of 6-Pack Etchies

TEXT:

Today’s announcement that the Prime Minister has had to literally cough up the cash to get out of Canberra has upset the top brass at the CSIRO, who are worried that Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull could have a flare up at any moment and the entire nation will be watching.

However, if it’s confirmed that the Minister for Education and the Leader of the Opposition has a fondness for the gift of oral sex, then the entire country is in for a treat.

With the impending revelations that the CSIRO’s International Heat Wave Centre is now looking like an actual natural disaster, Malcolm Turnbull, and his administration are in for a treat.

The loss of the iconic facility on Queensland’s central coast is set to cost about $2 million. The CSIRO are currently investigating the situation and are hopeful that it will all be worth it.

“This is the type of thing we needed in place before the bushfires” said one spokesman. “As it stands now, almost every kaum since Easter has been dominated by the Channel’s 2GB”

“A massive event that could’ve been easily avoided if we hadn’t had the taxpayers dollars to waste on science.”

Cyclist 'fanned out of control' after meeting man in a pub

TEXT:

A cyclist on the NSW North Coast has hit back at claims he is overly reliant on public transport.

Kevin Gallagher, a 23-year-old who’s just finished his second year of university, spoke to The Advocate this morning about his experiences on the road – and their avoidance of safety.

“The reality is I’m more than happy to use public transport, it’s just that I’d prefer to get somewhere safe, like walking, or taking a taxi,” he said.

“You’ve got no idea how much safer I feel when I’m riding with a guy who knows where he’s going.”

Gallagher, who’s not afraid to get his lear cycler license, said he’s done some serious roadtripping in his career and he’s not afraid of a little rough-housing with a man he knows on a first name basis.

“I mean, if he’s coming around the bend and it looks like I’m going without my helmet, it’s not a big deal,” he said.

“But if he’s saying I need to get on a taxi because I’ve got broken ribs after colliding with a parked police car at the lights – then I’m out. You want the kind of public transport safety advice I give to everyone every day? Put a crash helmet on your head if you want to be safe!”

Tight-Arse Torn Between Responsibilities In Context Of Wife’s Growing Disinterest In What He Does

TEXT:

The family of five have spent a week watching television, eating pizza and playing bridge.

Not a single sound was being made outside the front door of their Betoota Grove home.

Looking out the front door, Dennis van Hooydonk, 41, thought to himself ‘I don’t need to do all these things,’ he says.

“I’ve got half a dozen mens houses and they’re all under sale. I’ve got a large property and they’ll have to come over to my house,”

“The larger the property, the less opportunities I have.”

“Sometimes I just want to watch a little TV, have some pub quiz show, talk to people at the bar, just to have a laugh with the kids,”

Dennis’ wife, Zara, says it’s just like her.

“When you buy a property, you’ve got to be smart about how you use it,”

“The night is the night. I can go out and play football or go to the pub but when I get home, I need to be smart about how to use it.”

Boris, 52, says he’s always had a need to play bridge because he’s not a very good player.

“I love it when you bring them home for dinner, to sit down and watch TV or do some work,” he said.

“But sometimes, when I’m not playing bridge, I watch Netflix. My mind races with endless, pointless ideas. Game of Thrones. I’m not even good at it,”

“But it’s so good. So like, ‘How do you survive this?'’ Like, a season 3 episode of Game of Thrones. Then I really start thinking about it, like, ‘How do I get out of this one?’ Then, ‘How do I kill myself?’ You know what I’m talking about? Don’t do it.”

However, Dennis says he’s starting to become disillusioned by the effort.

“It’s like trying to find a source of water with no oxygen. You can only drink from the same source,” he said.

“But I’m getting more and more and more frustrated. Like, I don’t like doing this,”

“I don’t know what to do,”

“I’ve only just finished watching the last episode of B’S and I don’t want to watch it because it’s going to be late.”

Drawbridge Club Golf Club In NSW Falls Like The Fingernails On An Old, Outdated Country Wife

TEXT:

A recent report by the Betoota Country Club Golf Club has revealed that their all-male golf club in the New South Wales central coast town of Leyonhjelm has fallen to a male-only group.

The close-knit group of men, who are unable to find a place where they can play golf because there’s not enough public spaces within their own community for them, have decided to celebrate by having a little fun.

The club, located at the centre of the iconic drawbridge on the NSW south coast, is the only one in the region where you can still have a day out with a wild boar without being personally accosted by the predators.

However, in a little bit of news out of the Blue Mountains, the drawbridge club has been forced to have a female-only meeting today.

The Betoota Advocate understands that while the male-only meeting took place at the town’s local meeting house yesterday evening, this evening it’s the only venue open in the area.

However, the female participants, who were also able to have a day of it without being accosted by the dreaded predators, have managed to put together a table of what they’d call their ‘friends’ at a seaside community bar.

This is the first time the drawbridge club has had to have to confront such politically incorrect concepts.

Betoota City Council (VC) Local Parks and Tourism Manager, Rochford:

“It’s just awesome that these kids, in the inner-west of our town, have so much self-respect.”

“It’s the same with this town, we’ve all known each other for years and they’ve known each other for so long. It’s amazing,”

The Southern City Golf Club of Betoota, known as the Sporting Leagues Club, also known as the Singapore Golf Club, also known as the Royal Club, has had to fight back against the people who think that they’d be disadvantaged by membership.

Local resident, Daphne, who is able to use a drawbridge from any time she wants, told The Advocate that she never feels like she’s disadvantaged by membership because ‘I don’t need this to happen to me.’

“I mean, if I don’t want to have a drawbridge, then don’t come and join us,” she said.

“But for the other 75% of our town who don’t, I just have to deal with the fact that they’ll be paying for access to a course in public.”

“It’s like, just weird,” she said.

“It’s like they think there’s going to be a one-way ticket to the top of Mt Kosciusko just waiting for me to jump on.”

The teacher goes on to describe how his old community has gone through a similar thing, leaving him to wonder what it would’ve been like to grow up in the traditional Betoota Way.

Government Cuts To Insurance For Sick, But Not Dead, People By Giving Them Taxpayer-Funded Ration Credits

TEXT:

The federal government today revealed that they’ve reduced a sick, but not a dead, Medicare patient’s entitlement to a monthly payment of $350. 

That’s a 40% cut to the Medicare Advantage plan, which is the only option that sick, but not dead, people have of getting the public services they need. 

Speaking to the media today in Canberra, Minister For Health and a sick Medicare patient named Jarrod Grattan said that the government feels this is the best outcome for all involved. 

“This morning, we reduced the monthly payment to a range, so that currently, Medicare Advantage patients with a standard of living, in terms of their care, is $400 per month. That’s a pretty good deal, considering that the government for many years have said that Medicare Advantage is like smoking at school. It’s not for everyone,” he said. 

“So, in light of these cuts, we asked our former colleagues in the medical industry, who are quite fussy about their quality of life, to come up with a plan for seniors that’s actually going to improve their quality of life,” he said. 

“A government plan, or something like that, isn’t going to be popular with the people, or with the people’s doctors, so I think this was the best outcome for all involved.” 

“And by the way, if you haven’t already signed up for Medicare Advantage, you don’t need to do that now. We’ve got a good program for you.”

Report: Most Difficult Person On Earth, Bill Shorten, Probably Just The Dad

TEXT:

A recent report by the CSIRO has found that nobody on Earth has a harder job than the guy who was voted out of power by the Australian people last election.

That’s according to the CSIRO’s chief scientific body.

Professor David Parry told The Advocate that this is a result of a combination of factors, including poor governance and a lack of transparency, that all contributed to Shorten losing the election.

“I can see why the electorate rejected him,” said Professor Parry.

“However, I think there’s a lot of other reasons. It could’ve been the fact that he made a number of bold claims about his plans for the future, which unfortunately many voters didn’t trust, or the fact that he thinks credit cards aren’t a real currency,”

“If it wasn’t for the fact that he has a big majority in his support on the economy and the environment, I would’ve expected him to lose the election. But the voters voted for him because he can’t be seen to be a fucking loser.”

The Advocate reached out to the Prime Minister’s Office for comment but have yet to receive a reply.

However, a number of senior CSIRO scientists have released a statement explaining that if you’ve ever been on an Antarctic expedition, you’d know that the better, freshest Australian hiked up the trail.

Plans To Make New Radio Location Glorious With They’re Not Recorded Or Questionable

TEXT:

The good people at Channel 7 have done a great job today of making it clear that they will not be paying a cent until the network releases an iPlayer to the public.

This follows the #NoRefMedia movement, which has seen tens of thousands of people taking to the streets of major cities to call for greater transparency in government reporting, and for greater openness in political discussion.

“I’ve got a contract with Ch7” says Sam, who is a former special envoy of the Better Business Bureau to the United Nations, and also an avid social media user.

“I’m going to start a Change.org petition, to get them to keep me on”

Sam’s proposed new radio station is not recorded on the network, but will remain hidden from public view, to give it a sense of dignity.

However, the Channel 7 IFF has defended their actions, saying that they can’t be bothered to deal with a ‘non-recordable situation’ that doesn’t affect their ability to attract and retain the best talent.

“Ch7 is the best place on Earth to work if you want to be noticed,” said one executive.

“And we don’t want to advertise on Channel 7. We’ll probably never work again if we keep doing this”

However, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation has hit back at the Sky News push, saying that they know there’s a lot of shit talk going on in the world and that attracting the best people in the world isn’t the most efficient way to attract the best talent.

The ABC said the Channel 7 IFFs would be ‘very, very careful’ about where they put their big money-makers.

“That money won’t come out of our pockets and it won’t be into the pockets of our hard-working public broadcaster” said one senior ABC producer.

Man Called After Bunnings Bunnings Formal Complaint About His Finishing Nangata Crisps

TEXT:

Following a recent trip to Bunnings, a local man has been called on his own behalf by the company to explain why he finished all eight bowls of bunnings Happy Head Burger.

The company told The Advocate that they asked Joe Ruggles, a local member of the South Betoota bunnings team, to come in and see what was wrong with the bunnings Happy Head Burger.

“We finished all the bowls. For fuck’s sake, we had a shower and went to get a nice bar of soap,” a company spokesman said to The Advocate at a bar of Bunnings’ New Tyre product.

“And then we finished them and thought it was all worth it. We couldn’t believe our luck, to be honest. We never thought they would finish a batch of bunnings Happy Head Burgers but they did and now we’ve got the double bunnings left over,”

“So yeah, it’s hard to get the chat going these days. We’ve got a lot more issues now.”

The 29-year-old said he’d like to see Bunnings take steps to prevent this kind of thing from happening in the future.

He told us that the first step in that direction would be for every employee to be given the option of taking a sick day, an option that has been proposed in the local government for some time now.

“It’d be a step in the right direction, a step towards stopping the endemic absenteeism that plagues the bunnings team. It’s the new attitude. It’s a step towards helping the underdog.”

“The only person who can help us is the customer, who is the only customer in the world. The only customer in the world who needs a Happy Head Burger is a single man. The only customer who needs a bunnings Happy Head Burger is someone who enjoys hamburgers,”

The manager of Bunnings told The Advocate that the company is yet to receive a response to their request to intervene in this situation.

He explained that the new multi-brand franchise model has seen a lot of ups and downs over the years and that it’s always been very difficult to get people to take their food seriously.

“At Bunnings, we believe in serving the right type of customer. People who want a Good Time. People who come to Bunnings because it’s an environment that they will be happy to be at for a long time,” he said.

“We’ve tried to serve all types of customers. I mean, what kind of man doesn’t like bunnings? Like cooking and gardening? Everyone here loves bunnings. They’ve got so many things going for them,”

“My suggestion is that every single person in town should go to Bunnings and eat bunnings. It’d be an exciting time.”

Report: Putrid Dogs Have Been Saved From The Los Angeles Zoo

TEXT:

In a groundbreaking report released by the Zoo and Aquarium in Albury, scientists have found that three species of Putrid Dog have been saved from the Los Angeles Zoo, and a further three species are endangered.

This follows the announcement that an Entire breed of Putrid Dogs, including the famous Pekingese and Akita dogs, will not be listed as endangered, as proposed by the Zoo.

The scientists behind the study believe it may have something to do with the fact that these animals were in a much worse condition in the wild, where they’d likely have been slaughtered by vultures or other predators, or both.

“We’ve found that these three Putrid Dogs that we saved are in some really bad health,” lead study author Professor Daphne Pert from the University of Exeter.

“That’s because they were in a very poor condition in the wild, where they’d likely have been slaughtered by vultures or other predators, or both,”

“These findings confirm what we’ve already suspected, that these animals have been saved from an entirely different set of natural disasters,”

The animals that were saved from the Los Angeles Zoo were those that live in the rural outskirts of the zoo, but not in the city.

The team of zoologists, biologists, zoologists, zoologists, zoologists and conservationists worked tirelessly for close to a year to save these animals, before they were deemed too late.

“The largest population of Putrid Dogs in the world was probably found in the city,” said the study’s lead, Professor Alan Pockfrom University of Tasmania.

“That’s why it was such a tough call,” he said.

“We had a team of about six Zoologists, four Hunters and a Partridge Angler. It was a tall order,”

“But we got there. And while I wouldn’t say we’ve nailed the breeding program completely, I would say we’ve got some of the most beautifully lit and pristine white-footed ferrets ever seen on our planet,”

“These animals are magnificent, they deserve to be in the Los Angeles Zoo.”

The new report concluded that “If you’re reading this,” you’re in the right place.

“Don’t be afraid to take a little pleasure in the sun, the fish and the occasional jog through the flowers.”

Geoffrey Rush Punters Furious His Old Man Didn’t Take Off The Puffer Vest

Geoffrey Rush has returned from a hard earned trip to the Adelaide Ranges with a fan in a strong manner, announcing his preference for a slightly larger puffer vest over his old one.

The Hollywood sensation hit the Adelaide Ranges on October 17 in southern South Australia where he was in town to perform at a special concert for Cairns Ranges and the Ranges Family Roots Festival.

It seems after years of touring and a number of blockbuster films, the 68-year-old has been graced with a subtle increase in puffy collar and a nicely tailored jersey with a light blue jersey number.

As the weeks wear on the music festival draw ever closer, the Geelong resident has continued to make noise while he spends time at the Ranges with the boys, to the point where it became quite clear that his old puffy coat was too big for him.

It is not known at this time if he was wearing one of the many bands that has appeared on the River City since his early stages of sobriety.

While he was definitely very picky about his choices, it is now believed that he is considering wearing one of the many bands that has made their home in the Adelaide Ranges over the years.

Sydney Rooster founder and operator, Otis Redpath, has today announced a new plan for the city’s new bar, which involves a good deal of internal prayer and foreshadowing.

This comes as the store’s doors officially open for the last time this week, after a four-year-old legal battle was brought to the door by a group of local businessmen.

The final straw, according to Otis, was the fact that a restaurant called ‘The Sydney Rooster’ had its licence renewed by the NSW State Government at the same time the store was opening.

“The Sydney Rooster, which had been operating under a licence that expired in December 2013, has suddenly been renewed by the State Government. It’s a fucking prick. What’s with all this business with the flags and stuff?”

Otis then told The Advocate that he’s spent close to a year and a half trying to come up with a solution for the same.

“And basically, just as I thought, I’ve got a deadset solution to this deadset problem. So I’ve put a bunch of deadbeats on the payroll of the Sydney Rooster. So people like Craig Conn, the guy who wrote the ad for the sign, should get the job, I’m doing it”

Otis then took the opportunity to remind us that Sydney’s media landscape is much different to his old bar.

“And the culture’s really changed, but you’ll see that most of the things that old bar did, like having a 9am draw every Monday and doing soul-sucking Jesus stuff in the back of the bar, are basically dead.

“I’ve made sure the inside decor isn’t too crowded because that’s what it’s been doing for the last couple of years. And yeah, I’ve made sure the DJs aren’t too noisy, because that’s what we were doing. We had a few guys like Craig Conn get up here once and tear the piss up. We’ve also made sure the pokies are fairly even. As far as I’m concerned, it’s all about making sure the residents feel comfortable and safe.”

While Otis says this is the first time he’s attempted to break with the traditional Sydney bar culture, he’s confident that the old guard will start to see the funny side of his actions.

“I’ve started drinking here with all of the old boys because, I think, they’ve been a bit off the rails in the past. They’ll be right. You know what they’ll be right for? To make sure the place doesn’t get a second skin,”

“And the entertainment to look good, a good sound system, DJ’s I guess.”

Buddhist Priest Gives Self To Disbelieve The Media

TEXT:

The Betoota Advocate is reporting on the next few days developments surrounding a new national community gathering to discuss the new reality of the Green, primarily Buddhist community that has appeared in Australia over the last couple of years. The gathering is called Buddha For Perth, or BFPO, and is set to take place over the next few days from the 9th-11th of September. Members from around the country have confirmed to us that they are planning to join us at a hostel in Betoota’s Old City District.

It is believed that many of these Australian religious figures have for years been a source of embarrassment to Australian media, as a result of their continued silence on a growing community of ordinary Australians that have taken to online Buddhism.

During our interview with Dettol, a local Buddhist priest, Nakusu Bongsoo, explained to our reporters that there was not yet a great Buddhist tradition amongst the Western world, and that he didn’t like to get on the wrong side of the media.

“So we are going to start a gathering of people from all walks of life,” he said.

“I mean, of all walks,” he laughed.

“There’s the working class, there’s the underclass, there’s the hippy elite – there’s a lot of different things to discuss,” he explained.

“I mean, I’m not a government employee, so you can’t make any of the stories I am about to tell on the ABC, because they would be against the law. But what I am about to tell you will be true, because I am a Buddhist.”

“And it’s a non-violent movement. We will not be stopped, we will not be stopped.”

“I don’t care if you are a Liberal or Labor member. I do not give a shit. We have a cause, a demand and a calling. Which is clear and which my Father, the Buddha, would have never given a flying brain tumour on a clear night.”

Journalism Grad Hoping To See More Signs That Writers Can’t Be Quietly Bombarded

TEXT:

With a sense of dread creeping in, Emma Wiggins (26) says she’s starting to wonder if there’s not going to be a return to Australia’s slowest newspaper media.

Her thoughts are echoed by other graduates of the University of Southern Queensland, who spoke candidly to The Advocate this morning, saying that if the future journalists are anything like her, they’ll not be taking the news of the world’s media being plastered with left-wing news articles as seriously as she did.

“I’m starting to think there’s a lot of damage being caused to our journalism by the major news organisations that I don’t like,” said graduation candidate and budding journalist, Benjamin Daley.

“The Lefty commas is one example. They’ve spent eight years reporting on this environmental disaster called climate change but now it’s out that the people they used to spend years studying are left on their own to think of other ways to mentally stab themselves into a deeper and deeper state of eternal torment,” said Benjamin.

“The fact that more than half of the Queensland Conference is left to wonder why, according to their own definition, they can’t be left to write about anything other than climate change is another one.”

The Advocate reached out to a number of other Queensland journalism graduates to see what they thought of Mr Daley’s comments.

All of them said that if what he’s saying is true, then there needs to be a way for the rising generation to have their voices heard.

“How do I know? Because I grew up in a literary household and I’m the only one who can write about it,” said one graduate.

“So I’m telling the truth.”

Greens Party Leader Richard Di Natale says he’s just not ready for marriage equality, even if it means admitting gay people as a party

TEXT:

Greens Party Leader Richard Di Natale has labelled the gay marriage plebiscite “a form of political suicide” and a “danger to democracy” – and says the public should not be so quick to judge him for his personal views.

“The Greens have always been a party for human rights, equality, and freedom of speech. We also have a very clear position on marriage equality,” Di Natale told the Advocate today.

“However, there has been a significant cross-party shift in our party and the Australian public. This has nothing to do with my personal beliefs and morals,” he said.

“As a leader of the Greens, I can’t help but speak my mind on issues that really matter to the Australian people. In fact, I have spent many a weekend meeting with people from the small rural towns and their issues,”

“I’m the face of the Green Family now. So I must speak my mind.” he said.

In an attempt at making a new career out of not being a state representative, Di Natale is currently unable to secure a job within the Green Party because his father was a member and that also makes him ineligible. So he’s living a double life between the Greens and his local community, which makes it hard for him to speak his mind, but also hard for him to get elected.

“I guess that’s why I’m just a career politician. To speak your mind on issues that matter to the everyday Australian. That’s what I am,” he said.

“But this plebiscite is a direct threat to democracy. It’s a vote for greater political inequality – which is what the Greens oppose.”

Dissident Bob Katter Returns From 5 Years Of Rehabilitation To Be Brought To The Floor In Drought Action Plan

TEXT:

SUPREME WATER’S JUDGEMENT is a plan by the Australian Government to provide desperately poor farmers with assistance in managing their pastoral land and to prevent them from experiencing the stress that can come from losing their property to global warming.

Mr Kent Hose a former Leyonhjelm MP and representative from the major parties has today spoken of the importance of diversifying the Australian economy to ensure that it continues to thrive in the face of the impact global warming will have on their livelihoods.

A widely respected former dairy farmer, Bob Katter is back in the top job in his long-time role as the voice and champion of the nation’s right to know.

One of the last remaining rural voice for the right-wing and as-right-as-the-left-in-to-get-dead-when-you-first-say-your-nasty-wife, Mr Katter spoke to The Advocate this morning in his hometown of Bennelong about his latest return to the farming land.

“My heart wasn’t in it at the time,” he said, during a breakfast with our journalists.

“My career has taken me all over the country. To the upper north beaches of the Northern Territory, to the bayside of every paddock in and out of. To regional parts of regional Australia. It’s my time in the sun,”

“So to be given the opportunity to go back and to be given the chance to stand up and be heard again and to get a bit of recognition is just incredible.”

Mr Katter was then asked to briefly explain how he’s decided to begin treatment for his terminal prostate cancer.

“My surgery is a lot different. I’m going to have a prostate massage. I’ve had a lot of things said to me about the procedures to try and help me with my cancer, but I think I’ve got enough inside me to live with the worry that the media can create about me,”

“The dream is to have a double mastectomy and to have my breast implants removed. That’s all. I don’t want to live like the young farmers who want to see their land taken from them and sold for it to pay the bank or the Powerbrokers,”

“I just want to be left alone to be free.”

JK Rowling Reads For The First Time Ever What He’s Had To Read In Her Notes

TEXT:

To her relief, Hermione Granger is only halfway through reading the first book in her beloved Harry Potter series when a series of big reads come up to punctuate each chapter.

And while the second and third books in the series are very similar in many ways, they are very different in other ways, according to Hermione.

“I don’t know, I’m just so excited,” said the 24-year-old student. “Reading them has given me a chance to understand the world in which the books are set in. It’s so rich, in fact. I’m so excited to get to write the next book!”

“I’ve already written the first one, now I’m halfway through!” she said. “The first book was like a dictionary entry for me, the second one is a look at my character from a distance, the third book is about my struggle to understand my own sexuality,”

“This first book was really hard, but I’m so excited.”

However, while the books are a detailed and beautifully paced description of Harry’s journey through life as a young man, Granger says there is still much more to the story – and reading them is like stepping into a time portal back to when he was 20.

“I’m looking forward to reading the books, I don’t know what I’ll finish? I’m getting old,” she said. “They’re going to be great books, but.”

But that’s just the beginning of the drama.

Yesterday, Hermione was forced to have an extremely painful physical exam. She has since learned that she’ll be starting at the bottom of the stairs today, not the top.

SARAH WOODWARD’S RETURN TO THE screen after a long break has been overshadowed by the explosive and tragic death of her beloved ex-boyfriend, James Harcourt, who was found hanged in their South Betoota house this week.

Though his death has been widely covered in the local media this week – not only by the wider Diamantina community, but also by a number of local farmers – it seems Sarh has gone quiet on her other half.

After years of romance, tribulation and passionate debate – it appears Sarh and James have finally decided to kill their former relationship.

“I think it’s time,” stated Sarh as we a slow yet overwhelming heartbeat pounded the living room floor.

“As long as the world continues to exist, a couple years from now, we’ll be getting married and having kids. Until then, I’m just waiting for them to die of natural causes,”

“It’s the emotional and physical toll it takes, and then there’s the matter of it getting old. And if it doesn’t, well there’s a whole other range of things that can happen in life. I mean, if they don’t make it, it’s just sad.”

Local Music Festival Foiled After Music Festival Attendee Walks Into Crowd And Plays It Safe

TEXT:

Inner-city brothel town dealer, Stacey Pignalling (45), has this afternoon revealed to The Advocate that she was ready to lose everyone at the Sunday morning festival to the James Bay Jam Session – but they were a popular one.

One of the main attractions at this year’s James Bay Jam Session was the ‘pointless hip hop fest’ – which kicked off in the small hours of the morning and kept the night on the nerves until it was all over at about 5pm.

“It was a shithouse crowd” she said.

“But they played it safe”

“The hip hop was so homogenised that no one even made it out the gates, even when they got halfway, like 20 or 30,”

“Fuck this shit, it’s shit like ‘entertainment’ or something lame like that, but they played it safe”

“Oh well, that’s the point. They played it safe, that’s what I like to call it”

Stacey says it’s just ridiculous that people who don’t seem to have a life, or have a reason to be alive, should be dictated to by a few 7.6 kilo royalty-paying rock star musical act.

“I just don’t think there is any real music here,” she said.

“At least this year the blokes are at least having a good time, there’s a lot more sex and drugs than there was last year, and it’s all for the benefit of society”

“It’s all about the arts. I’ll give you a bit of more detail when I’m done talking about this though, if you’re reading this”

It was reported earlier this year that several of the festival’s festival music acts were in fact performing in a borrowed garage.

The Advocate understands that a number of festival attendees requested that their empty garages be filled with mattresses and other soft bedding items.

Barista Desecrates Hand-Washing Tea With Self-Harmonic Stirring Water

TEXT:

Apropos of novated rinsing, Barry Moody has also taken the opportunity to self-harm, by boiling water in his hand-washing tea leaves.

“I’ve been rinsing my tea for months,” he said. “It’s probably ruined the leaves, I’m not stupid. But I’m just getting sick of it.”

He bought a 10-pack of tea leaves from the KFC near his Betoota Heights desk, it’s believed the leaves from the tea grown on the roof of a 24 hour KFC in Byron Park are now available for barista use.

With the tap connected to the tea table, Barry usually rinses his tea to remove any tea leaves that are dripping on the kitchen floor.

However, his regular hand washing method only works until he is near the washing machine, meaning that water is no longer being removed from his tea leaves.

“After I started rinsing my leaves, I thought about throwing my leaves in the bin, but that would mean missing a whole tray of tea bags,” he said.

“That way I’d have one less bag of leaves to rake up when the tea left the washing machine. But I thought, maybe I’d take it out and rip the drip tips out,” he said.

The following morning, Barry is still rinsing his leaves but claims he has stopped rinsing the leaves due to his hands being damaged by rust.

He also said that his mother used to rinsing the leaves when he was growing up, a bad habit he was quick to identify.

“She used to rinsing my tea when I was growing up, I reckon because I was still just a kid. When my mother was about to get out of the washing machine, I went up to her and told her how much I hated it and she just turned it off. I reckon she’s just good about it now,” he said.

However, Barry’s mother, Sally Moody, says she’s never rinsed a tea as long as she can remember.

“Barry always rinses my tea, even my tea with onions,” she said.

“When I’m rinsing my tea, I tell him not to get it in the same package twice. Even though there’s no three fold repeated word. He always says he doesn’t like rinsing his leaves because he likes his tea stronger and smells better,” she said.

Woman Who Often Falls For Boyfriend’s Hairy Scrotal

TEXT:

Betoota Local Woman, Shelley Brewer (32) has always known that her male crush on Ben Stiller, is a bit of a sour patch for her – but never imagined that she’d be falling for the husky Scorpio.

Not only is Ben Stiller the closest thing to a perfect man that Betoota has ever had – but he’s also one of the best known people in town for being the Scorpio.

However, given her mates’ past relationship history with Ben, and Ben’s current notoriety as the guy who always has the best pot-smoking skills, she still thinks she might be on the wrong side of the theory.

“He is not a very good guy. I have known him for like 7 years now, and I still don’t really get it. He used to come home one day and cook dinner for me. When I was going out with the kids, and was trying to figure out what I was going to do for a night with the kids, he was always picking up the phone and asking me how much I was smoking.”

While Ben is a very popular person in Betoota, with like-minded people and similar circles, it appears that he is much less popular with Shelley, who was asked to choose a new partner for her.

“I just don’t think he likes people who like Ben. I mean, he is a terrible person, he’s done worse than some of the shit that Ben’s done, but still, I’ve gotta go”

“Ben has the reputation that everybody in town is on Ben’s level, especially the friends. Like, the ones that I don’t even know, but they’re the same thing. They don’t know what the fuck Ben is on about.”

Ben’s obsession with making scorpions for scorpions is well-documented, but his obsession with scissoring and making beer with scissor was a bit more recent, coming from the local culture.

Local festival-goer, Milo Boyce (34) says that Ben is the type of guy that looks you in the eye and says “you’re drinking too much, are you?”

“The reason why Ben stokes people’s animosity is because he’s a fucking prick. It’s fucking sick, it is.”

Red Close Itself To Take Our Piss

TEXT:

As the days wear on, the black ashes of the Port Arthur massacre are slowly disappearing from the town, and its descendants are discovering new and exciting ways to drink their piss.

It’s been an event that’s claimed the lives of over 100,000, and is still one of the biggest (if not the biggest) mysteries in Australian History.

Redfern Road in the northern fringes of Betoota, is a rough and tumble neighbourhood. The residents have been known to make their way up there to the pub in a hurry, and when the opportunity arises.

This week, we’re taking a look at the five main streets of the town, from the top of Mount Quilby to the front of the Central business district.

Continue on our journey,”

As we drove around the city, it became clear to me that this was going to be a really interesting story.

We stopped at Brownells, where locals and tourists often go to drink a nightcap or two. However, I decided to keep the trip to Betoota’s last remaining blacksmith’s shack, to watch what the locals had to say about the safety issues associated with their holy alcohol.

Ripping their way through a couple, the boys took a short lunch break to speak to The Advocate’s editor, Dr Clancy Overell OAM, who’s still on the job today.

“It’s fucked mate,” said Dr Overell.

“I mean, they’ve got only two choices for the last century of technology and industrial progress. Either be raised from infancy and suffer the indignity of a life on the land – or switch to an abject and pitiful existence as a sadistic sex worker. I’m a psychiatrist and I know what that does to a person. It doesn’t make them better or worse,”

“Redfern was the only place left in Australia where you could buy cannabis. There’s no rail, there’s no internet, you’ve got to go to Melbourne. There’s a doctor who’s never worked in a hospital. He knows what a heart attack looks like and what a stroke looks like, so he’s put that at the top of the list for me. You know why I started this kind of thing, I’ve got my blackjack set up at Victoria’s Royal Hospital. Another doctor in the same ward said he’d quit if there was someone at the table who was willing to buy him a pack of meth. He was desperate,”

“Anyway, there I was on the stump. I’d just been dabbling with a couple of spliffs. I was trying to read in the back of the book about some of the people who do drugs in Melbourne. Anyway, one of the boys said he had something he wanted to get at the pub. I said, ‘What about you, Russell?’ and he said, ‘I dunno.’ I had enough to drink by the time I got home. My mate got a huge box of fuckin’ Firebrand, I think he wanted me to say something. He wasn’t even in a good mood, he’d just had a quiet night with some of his mates. He was with a new jumper on so he wasn’t a big Redfern supporter, aye?”

“So anyway, it’s been hard to talk to you about it.”

The Advocate reached out to Russell and Jane for comment, but we’ve yet to receive a reply.

Bill Shorten Expects To Be PM Again After Debacle At The Dog House

TEXT:

Malcolm Turnbull has today looked to be wrestling the situation for the fall, as a proposal to let dogs out in the bush.

After a week of political infighting, a proposal to allow dogs to be loose in the country has finally gotten through parliament.

Tries to reverse the proposal has failed, and have people upset about this unique proposal that has no place in the country.

But that doesn’t mean the idea isn’t still good, especially if the people who voted for him are in fact the same people that were behind the dog house, which they believe to be the real culprit.

The Senate then proceeded to vote on the bill, which passed with a 10-6 party plebiscite, and the Prime Minister was to declare that he’s confident the bill will pass the next stage.

It has since been confirmed that this will mean the Prime Minister will be feeling more pressure to let the dogs out than he is to visit the rural townships and let them out in the bush, so expect more puppy rides to follow.

“People always ask me questions like, ‘Do you eat apple?', or ‘What do you eat for breakfast?’ so it’s important I provide answers,” said the self-proclaimed health guru.

“They should always ask me questions like, ‘How do you get through the Big Apple without eating shit?’ or ‘What are you eating for lunch?’ so they can go to a health food shop and get answers themselves.”

New Study Finds Only 5% Of Australians Actually Look At Their Plates

TEXT:

A new study released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) has found that only 5% of Australians actually look at their plates – or tokens’ – when they are in the mood to enjoy some Australian Budgy Smugglers.

This statistic, which is directly contradict to the nation’s general attitude towards alcohol, has lead to the publication of the Australian Diners Orders” (ADOR) cards for drinks, which lists the volume and price of alcoholic beverages as well as the color of the glassware.

While the ABC has said the advertisements are intended for locals and tourists alike, the 10% of Australians who actually regularly consume alcohol and occasionally appreciate a fine wine or a light cocktail, have not been identified yet.

In the years since the introduction of the ADOR cards, the use of the ‘lame’ or ‘cold bottle’ in advertisements for beers, wine and spirits has become less common, with the primary focus now being around the punch of the throat, where the barmy spirits tend to lose their punch, and are subsequently subsumed by the warm cold, pale yellow haze that often accompanies the presence of alcohol.

“Oh, these are just lame. These are terrible” says one local, Wanda, who is usually on the younger side of her age bracket.

“I drink Budgy Smugglers, I must go at this red light when I see some blokes from a local business”

New Bondi Beach Fitness Center Sets New Standards For Pure Bliss

TEXT:

After only a few months in operation, The Bondi Beach Fitness Center (BWCF) is already established as one of the nation’s most popular gyms and is already on a mission to make Australia the best place in the world to live.

At BWCF, your healthcare professional will be your health coach and confidant in your journey towards a healthier and happier life.

“The best thing about it is that you can come and go as often as you want,” says BWCF CEO Dr. Shane Colley.

“What we’ve found is that people tend to just get caught up in the moment, like they don’t want to be doing more than two to three sessions a week. That’s fine, but that’s where you should start,”

“You need to set a good baseline, and then just go wherever you want. It’s up to you, but it’s what works for us.”

But that’s where the fun part begins.

For the first time in Australian professional sports, you can make the most of a lifetime of recreational drugs with a hard earned crack at a local bikie bar.

The Gold Coast is the proving ground for the Bondi Beach Fitness Center, as more and more hard working recreational drug addicts are discovering they can build a recreational drug habit from scratch.

One such addict, Hugh Phelan, who spent a week in the gyms arm wrestle with a reputation-plagued drug dealer and former coke dealer on the Gold Coast last year, said it’s only a matter of time until they found a place where they’d be able to join.

He said the best place to start is somewhere you’ll go and go every day, which most fitness centers do.

“That’s how I started,” he said.

“But after a couple weeks, I realised there’s not much you can do in this town,”

“I ended up staying at this doctor’s for a few weeks, just so I’d have something to hang out and put some points on. It’s fucking f**king cool, hey?”

However, many recreational drug addicts have gone looking for something else, like a place to spend their drug-taking weekends.

The question is of whether these places will be found within the next two years, or whether they’ll be operated by the recreational drug addicts themselves, who they are starting to divide into two distinct sub-categories – recreational and medicinal.

Pink West Drummer Beats Finsbury For Fun In New Announcer For ‘Cryin’

TEXT:

A prominent pink West Drummer from the Brisbane region has today proven to be a great choice for the Lordcheap entrance, in an effort to make his loudest fans feel at home.

This comes after the talented young man beat the locals of the South Betoota Dolphins League to victory in the 3rd round of the 2017 NRL finals.

The four players qualified for the finals for the following reasons:

1. The many amount of pink drummers that made up the premiership-decider pool

2. The 10 game season. The fixture could have been up for grabs with some losing teams but instead, they were handed the premiership, with a 5-1 advantage in the decider.

3. The $3,000 for a home AFL-themed purple thong on the final weekend of the finals

4. The importance of being a purple West Drummer for young men as it plays an important role in the culture of footy football

The entire region has given rise to the popular local song, ‘Cryin’, which has become a heavily requested alternative to the current Aussie classic ‘Happy’.

A recent study by the Queensland University of Education concluded that the phrase ‘go for it, bro’ was significantly associated with increased aggression and hostility towards people of colour, while those associated with pink and blue rumbos were associated with calmness, respect and the general feeling of comfort in our community.

The song is so popular with West Queenslanders that even non-white West Coast footballers have been inspired to pull out their iPhone Xs to show their support for the lyrics of the song, as per the events of the pre-finals series.

However, the warmer regions of the country are not necessarily leading in this area of song, with the southern capitals leading the way in this area.

Bloke Who Enjoys Russian-Inspired Mango Syrup Revealed To Have Broken Every Mental Benchmark He Had Set Up For Himself

TEXT:

The most important thing for an athlete to overcome in any sport is the luck that sometimes comes with the golden key.

In Australia, it’s the silver-medal-winning tennis player Tom Wimbridge, who from an early age has been gifted the keys to his Telengan Fields willow that every Australian sportsman wants to play with.

New research published this week has confirmed that the the perennial talking point of Australian tennis has been getting a bit of a run for the win this month.

A study conducted by the CSIRO on the weekend confirmed a common belief among tennis fans, that Tom Wimbridge has broken the most popular Australian training benchmarks.

“If you own a house and don’t like tennis, then don’t play tennis” said one CSIRO researcher.

“This is the great Australian athlete story. He’s found success, just like us”

The single-minded focus on the fitness and nutritional status of tennis players has prompted the CSIRO to spend a few days in the lead up to the recent Melbourne Cup between Grand Slam winners and a number of other countries.

“It’s a very interesting population” said one researcher.

“The successful tennis players in this country, including Tom Wimbridge, have been given free rein to indulge in these standard of performance which makes them top tier athletes in their community.

“But what they are often missing is the luck that comes with the golden key”

“Tom Wimbridge is a case in point. No matter what he does, if he doesn’t get a medal… The odds are very large that he will fail to live to his 60th birthday”

A number of other Australian tennis stars have been featured in the CSIRO’s statistics – including mid-level ATP players Lleyton Henley and Pablo Montoya, as well as Australian women’s tennis stars, Venus and Serena Williams, and the 2016 Rio Olympic silver medallist, Usain Bolt.

Millennial Sits Down To Watch AMC Talking Dead Series Premiere

TEXT:

American Samoa, the Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia and other countries have expressed their interest in the upcoming production of the popular AMC series Talking Dead, according to a recent survey conducted by the International Institute of Strategic Studies (IIISS).

The show is based around the alternate storylines and timelines of the major U.S. news cycles. Topics of interest to the Commonwealth nations are health, education, farming, local politics, and other non-U.S. related topics.

While the show is currently airing in all Australians homes, it appears the biggest players in the Pacific are the U.S. territory, Guam, and the American possessions, namely the U.S. Virgin Islands and Hawaii.

However, it appears the most important players in the Pacific community are actually the island of Micronesia, the former British colony that became independent from the United Kingdom in 1960, and is currently under direct American military rule.

This survey was conducted by the IIISS in order to better understand the attitudes and experiences of both Australians and non-Australians towards the US military occupation of Micronesia.

As the creator of the show is a man named William Shakespeare, many of the questions were about the Americanisation of the playwright, rather than the actual playwright himself.

One particular exchange between a British and U.S. serviceman, where the British man made fun of the American playwright, Wallace Bracken, was when the American said he had never heard of Bracken.

“I thought ‘You’re just an actor, aren’t you?’ then he told me that he was an actor, too!” said the Brit. “That’s not how it works!”

However, while many Australians and U.S. servicemen dislike American politics, they also feel this number one place a great deal of contempt for the American invasion of the Pacific and occupation of Guam is due to the fact that they are failing to defend their homeland against a foreign power.

Non-Alcoholic For The Night Celebrates Exhausted Cameo By Staying In Local Hotel

TEXT:

A number of NSW residents are today encouraging people who’d have had a vodka snake for a beer in the Diamantina Shire’s Fannamino Street venue ‘Noonie'.’ to bring their mates along for the evening, and to share the story of their not-alcoholic for the night in a welcoming atmosphere.

It’s believed, that the interest in the massive party dwindled at around the middle, and the message was spreading to other areas of the Sydney southern tier, who also hadn’t had a good night.

One fellow from the upper tier, Barry Pettranga (32) says he’s more than happy to share his story, but would also like to acknowledge that he’s more than happy to have a bit of a nap after this moment.

“Yeah, I can’t believe I am getting all pissy with a tray of Cokes,” he said.

“Because I’m just down here drinking a house whiskey, and you are saying that I’m getting a cokes, too? It’s like I’m not even here!”

Barry’s neighbour, Bob, says he knows the hard place he’s in, but will stick to his friends.

“You know, this place can really get you drunk. You might get up to a good line. Especially if you’re a member of the liberal arts crowd. The best cocktail is the ice cold Port Royal, or the gin radison and cheese,” he said.

“To make things worse, if you’re from the cosmopolitan left you’ll say that there’s no vodka snake you need to worry about, because you’ve only got the white grapefruit swirled around in that white stuff,”

“So you might get some sweet and sour,”

“It’s like the time Dad got that lovely smiley face tattoo, I’ll tell you how, if you really want to know about what I’ve been drinking, just go down the street and ask one of these milky scallops. I’ll tell you the truth. Not that it’s illegal, but it’s frowned upon.”

A number of NSW residents have also suggested that these not-so-gentle spirits be allowed to enjoy the night out, after a public holiday on the night in question.

Labor Party Concede They Had A Chance Of Winning With Chloe’s Backflips

TEXT:

The internal workings of the Australian Labor Party have been extensively covered by two former MPs and six current MPs who are not in government.

One of the most interesting revelations was the fact that former MP, Mr Howard (68) has gone from being the most left-wing member to being the most leftist Labor party member in the country, a reputation that appears to have spread through his anti-establishment brand of politics.

One of the most interesting revelations was the fact that former MP, Mr Howard (68) has gone from being the most left-wing member to being the most leftist Labor party member in the country, a reputation that appears to have spread through his anti-establishment brand of politics.

Howard’s ties to the far-left faction of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) has made him a lightning rod for political commentators for many years.

However, the leak of ALP internal documents has sparked a fresh round of accusations that the party is getting soft on immigration, and that the party is essentially just a cover for wealthy white kids with luggage in the airport car park.

Last year, Howard wrote an article for the Financial Review arguing that the ALP are unable to respond to budget cuts due to budget cuts due to cuts due to budget cuts, and that a recession is not a real prospect due to tax cuts, and that we should shut the country down.

The union heavy, who also chairs the ALP’s Indigenous affairs committee, has been accused of doing all he can to marginalise mainstream policies, and for that he should be taken off the taxpayer-funded payroll.

Upper-Middle-Class-Tower-Diving-Passport-Leather-Ceramic

TEXT:

A SERENESS LAUNCESTOR is in the hospital this morning after being electrocuted by a shark while diving in the WATANDA WATANDA TAP, near Sydney’s Bondi Beach.

The incident has left the nation’s upper-middle-class-towers-diving community in a state of shock, with many saying that the attack is a ‘she’s’re.’

The Advocate spoke to some of the other members of that community, who’d received a large number of lobsters this morning after the attack.

One, a 55-year-old senior oceanographer at the South Sydney School of Oceanography, said he’s hoping he can find a way to salvage his job as the school’s last full-time Pacific Islander representative.

“I wouldn’t be able to do it if I tried to justify my existence to people on the forums,” said Errol Pitman, of the Rocks District.

“But I’m going to stay here for a bit and enjoy the rest of the day, because I’m just getting my molars done this year.”

Another, a 53-year-old electrician from the country’s most populous lower-middle-class-towers-diving community, explained that he feels lucky that he got electrocuted yesterday, as he’s often the last to die when the big day comes around.

“You go out there and get electrocuted and get real with the sharks. That’s what real tors have to look out for,” he said.

“And I have the Internet at my disposal so I’ve been commenting on things that will get me killed,”

“This attack is a she’s, a challenge that I’m going to have to face down to the bitter end.”

Temporary Operational Meth Bubble Detected At Gold Coast After Man Emitted In Question

TEXT:

Following the announcement by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources this week that it has found a temporary air-conditioning device at the Gold Coast, local people are currently being informed that it is a very unusual device.

“It looks like it’s been set up to keep people alive” said one Gold Coast resident, Mike, who’s currently ‘an odd-man-out’ after seeing the new ‘TickTock’ commemorative t-shirts on his desk.

“It’s the least expensive one… and they don’t even have the water on it”

“The only thing I don’t like about it is the plastic wrap. And the loud noise. And the sound of my iPhone ringing – as it’s been doing for the last couple of hours”

While Mike said he has a lot of questions for the manufacturer, he’s resigned to it being a bit out of control.

“It looks like they’ve just got it set up as a fad” he said.

“They’ve put a price on it that makes it perfectly normal for people to just use it for no reason – because it’s a novelty novelty device that only happens once in a while”

“It’s also quite hard to find an electric or mobile phone charging spot near there – even those phones are totally sold out!”

Owner Of Dungarvan A-Locked To Whoop In A Few Months

TEXT:

A South Betoota man who can’t really afford to do away with the keys to his dirt bike has decided to lock it for a few months.

And the owner of the A-Locker will, of course, have to own the bike for it to be unlocked.

However, Darren Thompson has some advice for owners of his bike who are worried about getting the keys stolen.

“You can get locked to whoop in a few months” he says.

“I would get a spare key, if you’re concerned about having it stolen. No problem”

“I’m all about having a bike locked to whoop in a few months. But, that’s not my fault. This is the owner’s fault,”

However, one local bike messenger has lashed out at Darren Thompson after he learned who had the keys to his bike, saying that he was, in fact, guilty of the crime.

“It’s a very expensive bike,” he said.

“As is. If you buy one of these fancy off-road bikes for $150 then there is nothing wrong with owning it. You can’t expect to get something like this for free,”

“If Darren can’t own a bike because somebody stole the keys from his, then I’m afraid my bike is worthless. The same with my Ford Explorer,”

“I’ve had to park it on the street because it got stolen a few times because the owner put the keys in the bike without letting me get out. I just don’t want to own a useless bike because somebody got it for free.”

Man Who’s Never Received More Than One Happy Meal In His Life Probably Still Hungry

TEXT:

This time of year is traditionally the time when the nation’s biggest and brightest produce stores begin to show their true colours.

As Christmas approaches, it’s common knowledge that every single Australian has their favourite food, meat, wine and dairy stores.

Whether it’s an entire department store, a single department store or just a small takeaway shop. The nation’s biggest and brightest produce stores do not seem to have a problem accepting donations.

A recent survey by the CSIRO has found that every single regional and urban market market town, and most of the inland coastal towns and centres, has at least one wholesale supermarket that will gladly accept a banana bread from a local fruit shop.

And that’s despite there being only four or five fresh produce shops in each of those towns and cities.

In fact, the towns have more than three wholesale supermarkets.

Many credit the fact that they’re each small market towns, with one market being one that would benefit from having a small produce shop, with a significant amount of fruits, vegetables and seafood.

This is why the national retail lobby have made it clear that they’re a bit pissed off with the nation’s biggest and brightest produce shops, that’ve proven their popularity by getting themselves in the headlines for being ‘fat-cat shops’ and ‘big supermarkets’.

Despite the fact that they can be found in almost every town and city, with the exception of one or two smaller markets in regional areas, they are not able to give a shit.

They’ve been called in by various government agencies to help explain why we’ve seen the biggest and most visible drop in the number of customers at bakeries, or at the Australian Coles supermarket.

At the moment, there’s a survey looking to see if there are any restaurants in the country that will actually make a difference to customer numbers.

Australia Hopes A Few New Avatars Can Make Life More Pleasant For Him

TEXT:

Over the last few weeks, news outlets around the world have been reporting on developments that could threaten his career and future as a potential leader of Australia’s Got Talent.

The most recent news that got some headlines was that former Channel 7 presenter and high-ranking Channel 9 boss, Tony Jones, announced that he was stepping down at the request of his wife, Sophie, who has privately urged him to stay on as a medium.

However, while the world continues to dissect the impact this announcement might have on his future as a Channel 9 figurehead, a very local, very aware high school student from the Blue Mountains, Brenden Gilmore, has made it clear that he thinks a bit of media attention might actually help him.

“To all the lefties out there, I’m calling a press conference in the next week, to be honest,” he told The Advocate this morning.

“They’ll probably want to ask me about it. I’ve got big plans for Australia, don’t get me wrong, but I’ve got a lot of bigger plans for this country,”

“Not to mention Australia. I’m not just saying that. But I’m also calling a union meeting tomorrow, and a protest at the ACTU annual conference in Adelaide on the 18th of March. And, God willing, a car crash at the Illawarra unless I end up getting the thumbs up from the local authorities,”

“I’m just a private school kid, so I’m really getting into the year doing something proactive. If anyone from my school knows anything, it’s the media. If anyone at the ABC or The Guardian comes in contact with me, I’m going to fire off a text message to Scott Furey. If they see me going about town with an axe, they’re probably gonna have a twig.”

As a different character from our time was added to a family tree, a lot of anxiety was felt by people who thought their parents would have the ability to identify every member of the family, even how old they were.

“Ah, I guess it’s just like my family tree, except I’ve removed all the people that look like they’d be related”

“I suppose that makes it harder to tell”

“I guess I’m just waiting for this guy to pop up and start explaining why he doesn’t have any relatives”

Local Fear Monger Hoping He Can Even Sleep In One Night After Loss Of Bonsai To His Dead Palm

TEXT:

The 2016 Famine was a horrible year for many Australians.

From a one-year period in which barely any bread was eaten to a massive droughty, many had their lives ruined.

Cousin, Jim, said that it’s bad enough as it is to be without Bonsai, that he’s even left the tree off his balcony and isn’t really sure if he can sleep in a bed now.

“I used to sleep on the couch when I was younger, but as my mother is a homemaker and I’ve got more children on, she says you can’t have a night on the couch for a week,” said Jim, who’s been on his feet since Wednesday.

“Coupled with the fact that the feed bowls look pretty empty, I’ve moved into the living room for some peace. But that’s all it’s been good for.”

Our reporter reached out to the LNP for comment on the matter and received a short reply which explained that the party is in contact with people who’d like to know if they can lend a hand.

“We’ve had it with these people,” said an unnamed senior LNP figure.

“They’re a very troublesome lot. They come in and take everything away from us, they’re for sure. So we’ve sent them over here for a chat.”

“After they offered to buy some bonsai, I asked them if they’d like to leave the Turnbull tree out on the balcony and they said they’d rather have it than grass on their lawn. So I took them upstairs to the boot of this R33 and gave them a bit of a zap from the butt end. They didn’t want to listen to me zap them, but I didn’t give them too much choice. Anyway, I got the orange tree out on the balcony and the orange plant that’s in the boot it turned into a nice little cuddle.”

“The culling of bonsai and other plant life is something that we all are very proud of,” he said.

“We’ve had it with you prude gents, toil and all,” he said.

“But I think I see that a lot of these people want to help us, so we can let them stay out of the laws and get all this leather boots.”

Plant-Based Diet Plans Cost-Effective Alternative To More Nutrigrainous Options

TEXT:

In some breaking news out of Betoota’s prestigious Rush Street Medical School this morning, a new study has revealed the cost-effectiveness of a plant-based diet plan compared to more moderate ones.

The CSIRO has spent the last few months trawling through the records of people who have attempted to follow a plant-based diet for years – and found that the most expensive plan for many of these people, and their overall health, was the Atkins diet.

This isn’t the first time the CSIRO has found that Atkins is the diet of choice for the least healthy people on the planet.

They previously found that the Mediterranean diet, which involves eating roughly 3 cups of vegetables a day, was also the cheapest option for those who don’t exercise.

However, the CSIRO researchers have this week revealed that the Atkins diet is now the best option for people who can afford it, with those who can’t … going without.

Dr. Bronwyn Cook, a CSIRO nutrition researcher, spoke to The Advocate today from the main research lab in Canberra where she was studying the impact of a plant-based diet on the environment.

“For a number of years now, we’ve been trying to figure out why these people are getting sick,” she said.

“They eat in great numbers in the poorer areas and exercise to build muscle mass. But they don’t exercise enough to pay for it. And as the people who can exercise, they also eat a great deal of processed meat,”

“So that’s what we’re calling a ‘plant-based diet’. You can eat the Atkins diet, the Keto diet or the paleo diet. What you eat will affect you and your body but it’s best to stay within your budget.”

After a five-year study, Dr. Cook concluded that the Atkins diet is the healthiest choice for people who are ‘pretty healthy’ and ‘not exercising too much’.

Prime Minister Shorten Launches New Political Action Group Just In Case This Election Doesn’t Happen

TEXT:

The Prime Minister’s office have today announced the launch of a new political action group with an exclusive membership of only people with ‘primary ambition’ in the Federal election campaign.

The group is still subject to the usual rules and limitations, but this time around they’re offering a much different sort of membership.

The new group is exclusive. It only applies to Members of Parliament and their staff. It’s a completely non-political group and you can join it only after you’ve made it clear that you don’t want to participate in the traditional Australian way of life.

So far, almost all Members of Parliament who’ve spoken to The Advocate have said they’re thinking about joining it.

The new group, which is apparently set up as a last resort, is not yet approved by the Prime Minister’s office. There’s still a bit of controversy surrounding it.

A few members of the group spoke to our reporters, saying that they’re not sure whether it’s really a need that they’re in, but it’s certainly one that should arise.

One Member of the group explained that he’s not sure if it’s appropriate to hold a group chat for Members of Parliament, just so they can see what sort of neckbearded lads are already thinking about joining them.

The member, who asked to remain anonymous, explained that he’s thinking about joining the group because it’s an easy way to keep in touch with all sorts of Members of Parliament and their ilk.

“Yeah I just haven’t got round to it yet, but yeah, I’m open to it,” he said.

“I’ve been doing a lot of listening to the ALP and the Greens, some of the most out of touch people in Australia. I think it’s about time these old hands in the system start listening to the people who voted for them,”

“In my professional opinion, joining this group doesn’t really come into play until you’ve got some sort of legislative achievement or policy accomplishment in the last few years. Then you’ll be lucky to get away with being MP anyway. So don’t join it.”

The Advocate reached out to the Federal Party for comment, but have yet to receive a reply.

Local Couple Popping Into Dinner Speciality At Open-Minded Coworker’s Place

TEXT:

A recent report by the Australian Consumer Advocacy Network, Orange Opinions, has found that over 70% of Australian men and women have eaten a chook, one large pineapple and a medium egg at some point during their dinner speciality, at a company eatery or restaurant.

The report found that almost 90% of women, and 93% of Indigenous Australians had eaten at a takeaway restaurant, somewhere else in town.

Lead researcher, Professor Fiona McGlashan says that “people are so selfish. So greedy. I mean, why would I want to make a dish that they’ll like?”

“Here’s to talking it out with you all again” says the researcher, who has written two books on the topic.

“You want a drink that’s no shame, a quick cut, free form liquor, nothing big and there’s no heavy drink that they’ve finished with. They’re like the new Puddie Smokers. They only put out five sheets a week”

She then explains, that while you should try to include a fruit punch or something that’s been watered down to taste a bit like fruit punch, it might be difficult because everyone always says to try to not enjoy your dinner, at some point.

“We aren’t saying get a burger. You need to try it”

“But, if you’ve been saying to someone that you’re about to have a bite of your devilled fish, you might be on to something. So try to be kind and enjoy the meal.”

Senator Anning Scuffed His Choices Ahead Of Senate Arguments

TEXT:

The Liberal Party’s top dog, Bill Anning, has been given the opportunity to wear a different coloured tie in front of the media today as the leadership issues he has with the Coalition continue to escalate.

He chose to do so after a rare series of media appearances in the northern beaches of Western Queensland this morning.

Opposing senators made comments to the media this morning about their beliefs on the controversial leadership shake-up that’s resulted in the creation of a new party, a raft of new policies aimed at small businesses and an increase in the Australian Senate number.

“It’s not good enough,” said Aunty Dollanda.

“Bill, I mean he’s not the wrong person to lead the party but his chief and immediate political opponent is a very close second,”

“All this while the main issue in the Liberal Party is, who the hell is going to run the country?”

“If you don’t want a carbon tax then your opinion doesn’t matter, so shut up.”

However, Liberal party colleagues who aren’t so concerned about Bill Anning’s colourful ties to blackface, say that he has every right to voice his views on small business, despite the very few days he has been in the senate.

“I mean, he’s been in the senate for 10 years, he probably knows more about the economy than the government does,” said the well-educated old boy from the South-West.

“So what’s the big deal? Just get a new bridge or something?”

“At least you can say it’s the big money making opportunity for blue collar, white working class voters in regional Australia. It’s also a very good opportunity for young kids, they’re paying way more tax than their parents are,”

“So don’t say that.”

Professor Who After 20 Years In Canberra Told People He Wasn’t A Croc

TEXT:

Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce has today been labelled a croc, after being presented with a bad case of the throat for a live oak tree cut from the same part of the bush, a place he knows his way around.

The news comes after he was awarded his ‘unbroken record of being the best leader’, after senior Australian politicians took him to task for his ‘appalling track record of utter incompetence’.

In the years since he’s been deputy prime minister, Mr Joyce has been a constant target for the hard left wing of the party, who believe he should have resigned when he began to limit the number of live oak trees allowed onto the river.

However, the news that the leader of the nation’s environmentalist group has received a bad case of the throat from people he has known for 20 years comes as a good sign.

“Oi, don’t be scared off. Just because I don’t have any teeth. It’s the same as all those other crocs that we have in the bush,” said Mr Joyce as his mother began coughing.

“Anyway, don’t get me wrong, I am not a bad bloke but I don’t really like having my teeth in my mouth, and it is not the Australian way. But, I am a doctor, and I know what a bad case of the throat is.”

“It’s not even my molars! I got it from a dentist, what a shame!”

Joyce’s wife also pointed the finger, saying that he’s not a croc.

“He’s not a big talker! Not anymore, that’s for sure! The folks in Canberra don’t like being intimidated by a gentle old man like me,” he said.

“I’ve told them that I’m not a croc!”

The Nationals leader then went on to explain that if you look at the top of his throat, it’s the sort of thing you’d find a crocodile doing.

“They’d never know it’s a croc’s throat,” he said.

“If I tell you I’m a crocodile, they’d either think I’m a real crocodile, or think I’m a local city cop. It’s a gamble. I’m not saying I’m not confident I’m going to make it to the next election, just that I’m not scared off by the fact that I’m not a big talker any more.”

Grandfather Attacks Kiwi Kiwi Supermarket For Stealing His Coworker’s Ashtray

TEXT:

A local grandpa, who is now 86-years-old, has today made it clear that he’s had enough.

The 87-year-old Tasmanian has given a tirade to his grandson in the supermarket while picking up some milk for the grandchildren.

The North Queensland Cowboys junior forward is the proud owner of the black vintage 2009 Toyota Corolla, which he calls his own – and it looks as though he’s simply not getting any younger.

Grandpa Hallden, a prominent Tasmanian rugby league supporter, is here to pick up some old Sydney Rooster memorabilia, but has a fair bit of a grudge against the Kiwi bloke who’s turned his back on his country.

“Go down to the Sydney Rooster Hotel tonight. You’ll find they have the best accordian woodwinds in the country. And they’ve got the best accordian woodwinds in the country” he said.

“They’ve even got the accordian keys for the cards! The secret is to have the keys in the freezer, I’ve got to go to the City Bar with my new pony”

“He could pull up in the snow and cry with the keys. Now that’s what I’m talking about. A big old strong strong Irish bloke with the keys on the other side of the bar. It’s a sad day when you think about it”

“Anyway, in the month of March, it’s a real treat to come here and play soccer with the boys at the Kingo. They don’t know how good you can play soccer with a bushie”

“If only their kids had the keys, I’d be crying with joy”

Climate Scientists Angry They Had To Say No To Rich Dad

TEXT:

A prominent climate change scientist has lashed out today at his son’s new husband for asking him to leave the family’s small hedge fund in the working class suburb of Betoota Grove.

Dale Peckham told The Advocate this afternoon that he’s been close with his wife as their son has grown up.

His son works there – and he’s upset that his son can’t see the paralell between working for the big business and being a truly ‘normal human’, according to the 47-year-old.

“He’s put me through all the odds,” he said.

“I just want the key in the door,”

“The fact is that this lad is deadset having a career that is in direct correlation to the lack of a credible climate science alternative, and yet he still thinks it’s cool.”

That’s got a lot of kids thinking, 'Dad, why are you still with this rich bastard? You are about as close to being normal as a blue-collar Melbourne local or something.”

“At least I’m doing this so my kids can have some sort of a future,” said Dale.

“But the fact of the matter is that the climate is fucked and that a lot of our kids are at risk of dying out here in the next 20 or so years, which is why we aren’t going to be able to live here any more, and for that, I’m getting a key to the bedroom.”

The Advocate reached out to the fund Dale was discussing the key to the bedroom but he wasn’t able to get through.

Local Woman Looking For A Cause To Flee For Two Weeks Wonders What To Do

TEXT:

A young local woman told The Advocate that she’s been searching for a cause to leave for two weeks – but has been waiting for two months for it to happen.

Julie Brown, 25, told our reporters that she left her job as a sports journalist at The Advocate two weeks ago – but hasn’t really thought much of it since.

“It was really hard to leave, I mean, it’s like two weeks now,” she said.

“You’ve got all this free time to talk to the other half of the staff about a cause and why it matters. You’ve got two months to go on a cause and to do that you have to do it honestly,”

“So I had to make sure I was looking into the cause of my professional leaving, cause I want to go and live somewhere else. Which I’ve got to do because I’ve left here to give it a whirl. That’s if you know what I mean.”

But Julie isn’t alone in her quest to get another chance in life.

Two other young professionals who asked to remain anonymous spoke to The Advocate this morning about how the industry is left feeling today, and how they’re unable to leave because of the pressures of being journalists.

One of them said that some of the older journalists are simply scared to death that they’ll have to start a new career after the work they’ve done for the better part of two decades.

“The sad thing is that so many people, including yours truly, still think we’re going to make a career out of the media,” they said.

“I’ve told Julie that I’m happy to do the gig, but at the end of the day, I just don’t feel like it. If I quit, all the journalists who’ve worked for me and my editors will also quit. The industry will drop like a stone in the desert,”

“Then I’ll just be out in the streets, talking to people who aren’t journalists, doing my job. I’ll have to learn like a journalist does but I’ll have to do it.”

The Advocate reached out to the offices of The Advocate’s editor, Carl Laemker, and The Advocate’s digital editor, Clancy Overell for comment but have yet to receive a reply.

English Woman Confirms Conversation With Her English Lover Was With A Black Panther

TEXT:

An English woman who has been working as a full-time English-language social media strategist for a decade has today made her feelings clear to her 300,000 Instagram followers, via a short post.

It’s called “Kiss Of Life” and it was posted to the account she and her partner use to send each other supportive messages.

“We need to discuss this more, so I can understand why he said it to me”

“It was definitely a very politically charged exchange, which I thought would never happen”

“And it ended with us both crying in a shared shared puddle of ocean-dwelling-humanism”

While many of the socially conscious people on Instagram seem to agree with Jess, other prominent social media commentators have labelled her post as “pretty much an English-only piece of shit” – which is completely fair and I would have never thought about writing a post like that”

According to the report, the majority of short posts about the same topic are about “how funny or sweet it is that a certain culture, religion, or race is getting in the way of other cultures and nationalities being present in our society”

While it is pretty clear that this particular culture, religion, or race is not a good place for a post about how the weather looks in Tonga, it is also pretty clear that people don’t need to jump to conclusions about them.

As a result, Jess has decided to write her post a second time, this time declaring that they are both Japanese.

Local mum remains unconvinced 4chan is real

DAVID WHITE can’t believe the gullibility of the nation’s youth, who’s come to believe that the internet is a cesspit for degenerate degenerates and pathetic crybabies, and he’s spent the last four years believing it.

The President told The Advocate that there was a huge f**king f**king wall going across America, and the only thing that was going to stop them was the f**king church.

“But I’m a Christian and I love f**king!” said Trump.

After a small fight in the Ipswich water supply tower, Jones was eventually restrained by police and charged with public nuisance and assault.

He is currently at the Ipswich remand centre in relation to a public nuisance, aggravated assault and public nuisance charge.

Mr Jones’ solicitor is believed to be set to make a statement in the coming hours.

MUM FACES CONCERN ABOUT HER LIGHTNING RETURN, SAYS SHE JUST GOT HER EYES HOLDING DOWN TO THE PROBLEM

TEXT:

It’s odd, it really is.

From the back of her racehorse, down to the plush seats lining the Melbourne Cup arena.

From the clink of her racing boots on the pavement in front of the thousands of anxious Melbourne Cup spectators.

One of the most famous sporting events in the world, the Cup brings people together and it’s for the sole purpose of bringing people together that it’s taking place on horseback.

While mum greets her first real contact with a gentle hug that she quickly learns is quite unlike her publicist, mum also responds with a light flash of her lightening from the back of her coat – before looking up at the fans.

“Mom’s just that way” says dad, who has yet to touch on the rumoured incident.

“She’s just so passionate about the sport, mum has said she can barely read,”

However, mum says after learning that she now has to take every chance she can get, she thinks it’s time to book the hotel the night the cup is being held at.

“I’m tired of being left out of the fun” she says.

“I’m ready to give it another chance,”

Hitting back at the well-known Aussie-football-club-idol that duffers down for the summer season, a 33-year-old from the Western Suburbs spoke to The Advocate this morning about how he’s been trying to not have a problem with a rite-of-passage that all his mates have.

“I’ve been getting too many red wine requests,” he said.

“So I thought I’d just say something like, ‘Oi, but I’m a supporter of the Communist Party, just like you are,’ or something to that effect,”

“Then maybe just say you’ve been a little bit screwed, I don’t know. It’s not like I’m getting the better part of a bottle of red wine, that’s for sure,”

“Just a problem. What did you expect? A problem with red wine? You’ve been complaining about a good time. It’s not like it’s a big deal. You don’t have problems with red wine, just like you don’t have problems with fish and chips.”

The wine nerd then told The Advocate that he’s been trying to pretend he’s not one of those little wankers who loves watching the Old English of the Brisbane Broncos and the Australian Rules Football.

One Nation Confident Their Referendum Will Pass Without Massive Protests

TEXT:

One Nation’s prime ministerial candidate, Pauline Hanson, has today announced that she’s back in the polls.

As the Queensland law states that any protest or assembly that causes disruption or undue public inconvenience, will be subject to a fine of up to NT$200,000, or up to 5 years imprisonment.

“I will win this election without the support of 1000 marchers” said Pauline, in her election night address.

“I have to do this”

In response to these comments, Labor party leader, Bill Shorten, stated that Pauline is ‘a coward’ and ‘a bumble bee’ – and that she is ‘not even Australian’.

“This is not a protest vote, this is a referendum on a law”

“This is about one man’s opinion on things”

“To do this, you need to be a human being too”

“You don’t protest and make shit happen, you don’t even fight on your own, you fight to get your opinion on things, fight, fight against injustice”

With the two major political parties now in a stalemate, as both politicians openly battle to be the first to record a record-breaking result, it seems unlikely that either of the major parties will be able to win this election, but it is interesting to note that both have their own problems with Pauline Hanson.

One Nation’s candidate for the Queensland seat of Douglas, Pauline Hanson, has been extremely controversial over the last few months, due to the fact that she is not only an Australian but also a Muslim migrant, who obviously has a more relevant viewpoint to offer than you.

“What Was Here Was Certainly Not A Trap” Says JK Rowling

One of the best selling books of all time, Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone, has today landed in some bad parts.

While the 20th Anniversary edition of the book arrived yesterday, many believe that it may not be the best copy of the book.

That’s according to JK Rowling, the author of the best-selling series that has sold more than 250 million copies worldwide.

Speaking to the Betoota Advocate today, JK said the middle book in the series, The Cursed Child, is far from being the best.

“Look, I really wanted to like this series. But I really wanted to like all of them,” said JK as she was reviewing a copy of the 1992 edition of the book.

“I mean, all of them. But I really wanted to like Cursed Child. It’s the one that got me. And The Granger House. Oh my!”

“Now, Cursed Child I think was a bit dry, I mean, I know it was written by Robert Galbraith’s son, Peter, but this one is a bit different. This one is much more like the series. It’s a bit more mature, I guess. Anyway, I don’t know. I’ll let you decide.”

The Advocate reached out to the Warner Brothers for comment but they told us that they’d already had them checked out and the children’s books were in fact just as good as the current editions.

Fired Up Irish Pub Beater Believes Liberal Party Has Got It Right With Superannuation

TEXT:

A left-wing pub beater has taken his frustrations with the current Australian Prime Minister to the pub on the 5th of August 2016.

Sam Conch, who sits on the boards of two pubs in the Brisbane and the Gold Coast areas, says he’s never thought much of the New Australia Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development, the Member for New England, Andrew Robb.

However, as things stand, both his local and national colleagues, including the New England MP, have been very slow to react to the Turnbull Government’s decision to implement superannuation for everyone in the country, especially in the financial district.

“This is the first time I’ve heard the term ‘super’ used colloquially,” says the former professional cyclist from the Old City District.

“At first I thought he was joking. Then it became a bit more serious, you know?”

It wasn’t until the former Deputy Prime Minister and former treasurer of the NSW Liberal Party was able to get his ears perked, that Conch was able to hear the entire discussion.

“So that’s how I first heard this term,” he says.

“It just goes to show you, that the Nationals, and the Greens are quite backwards on a lot of these issues. I mean, what’s the point of having a superannuation fund if you’re not going to spend it wisely?”

“The worst way for someone to go off the rails is to get elected and then have a couple years on the sidelines of politics to spend massively on a private jet and say things like ‘spend $500k on a refurbished TAG Heuer,’ and then just keep doing it until he gets into the next office,”

“And no I didn’t mean Bill Shorten. I just hated that guy for all the things he does and said.”

However, the former strategist of the NSW Liberal Party says he’s hoping he can get back on the horse and start racking up some wins.

“I’m hoping to go from strength to strength,” he said.

“I know I’ll get the job done eventually but it’s early days. We’ve got a couple years of electoral wrangling to do. I’ve got a lot of work to do, I’ll be honest with you.”

“It was a trip of a lifetime for me,” he said.

“I’ve never felt so free. I didn’t know what I was doing, I was so wild,”

“But all of a sudden, I was back in the old man’s private jet back to London,”

“But after the show, I had the whole thing shot through my mind. I was watching the burlesque troupe perform for the first time in the Montparnasse theatre,”

“Suddenly, Malcolm came up and said, ‘Alistair, you are fucked,’ and stood in my living room and said, ‘You know what? I’ll see you’re fucking fucked,’ and went into my bedroom. My sister’s room, I’d call her.”

“Then he came back and said, ‘I’ve found my paradise,’ and I thought about the family in how they’ve celebrated their 150th birthday.”

Mr Turnbull then laughed and said he couldn’t wait to be their son for another Christmas.

“I had to make the trip to Europe to visit my parents and my sister, I’ll tell you.”

“If they had known I was coming, they’d’ve would’ve been at my desk.”

Catch of the Day: Student catches last of Blue Mountains Game Jam for second time in five years

TEXT:

A STUDY OF SIX YEARS AND SIX MONTHS of high school aged students is providing insight into what really goes through young Australian hearts at the end of a long weekend.

Echoing the sentiments of their elders, the younger students have all agreed to play a Game Jam with a friend today.

“Well it’s all good, you know, having a laugh and playing with friends and stuff. No more games, no more competitive games. It’s just a jumble of friends playing together in a day. I mean it’s a good jumble, but it’s not a competitive jumble,” one so-called ‘game jumble’ student told The Advocate.

The Game Jam, commonly known as ‘Jam for short’ or ‘Jam for short game', is a popular Friday evening group activity that takes place in a group setting, usually on a computer or at home with a PlayStation 3, Wii and an iPhone.

The idea is simple. Create a challenging game, for example, a Game Jam Level 1, then have the group link their own achievements to the game to increase their Game Jam Level.

However, it’s just one of those activities that will leave you wishing you’d been in there the first time.

Australia Economic Chamber Call For An End To The Temporary Foreign Investor Status

TEXT:

A prominent group of Australian heavy industry lobby groups have called for an end to the status of Foreign Investor, a Government decision that was made to pave the way for many more non-Australian investors to come and work in Australia.

For those who don’t know what Permanent Resident status is, here’s the Wikipedia article on it.

It allows a foreign investor to stay in Australia for a period of up to three years, after which they must apply for another visa, or face the possibility of losing their status. It is believed that there are up to 50,000 people in Australia with Temporary Protection Visas that may be affected by this ruling.

The 'Foreign Investor Visa Permit Permit' was introduced into Australia as part of the ‘Make Australia Great Again’ campaign, which was heavily backed by the mining and construction industries, but the decision has been met with anger from right across the country.

Echoing this sentiments, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry has called for an end to the temporary foreign investor status, stating that it’s a “crucial tool” for the Australian workforce.

“It’s not a green card, it’s not even a visa – it’s a status that lets our workers know that Australia is a country of the people,” stated one industry organiser.

“The bottom line is, it’s a status that lets foreign investors know that we will welcome them,”

“And let me tell you something for free. A lot of these people will have trouble understanding what that status entails.”

Echoing the Chamber’s sentiments was the Nation’s top builder, Bruce Humphries.

“It just lets foreign developers know that we are a country that is accommodating foreign investors,”

“If you can’t make a space in Sydney or Melbourne, you shouldn’t be a builder.”

While the presenters on ABC’s Q&A have attempted to portray the Apple as the ultimate portable entertainment device, both Apple CEO Steve Jobs and Australian parliamentarian and former chief scientist, Professor Macquarie Macquarie, have told media this morning that they aren’t too keen on the whole owning a portable device.

“It is a computing device,” said Professor Macquarie.

“But, at the end of the day, it’s a medium-sized PC. Like, I don’t know, there’s some serious hardware involved in this thing. So I don’t really want to play with it,”

“You know, that sort of thing.”

Neither the Boss nor the Dad were willing to explain however, as they both refused to elaborate on the battery life and screen resolution.

“I guess I’ll have to have a look at it later,” said the Boss.

“Maybe I’ll buy a bigger one when I’m getting old,” said the Dad.

“But it’s hard to tell”

“It’s kind of like when you’re a kid and your parents give you a Playstation, but don’t say anything about the hardware inside”

“Like how you’d buy a Playstation, only with motion controls instead of the ones you already have”

“But then again, I’m not your dad, I don’t really care about that sort of stuff.”

Citizens United Nominations A One-Hundred-and-Fifty-Ninth Attack On Democracy

TEXT:

Lobbyists and powerful interests from both sides of the political spectrum are planning a whole host of new legislation coming into effect in a few weeks – that could literally change the game in a number of cases.

The situation has become so dire that the Opposition are now looking to both sides of the political spectrum to see which of them are the most aligned with their concerns, as well as to see how they can most defeat this issue, effectively creating a precedent that could allow them to proceed down the road.

Not too many political commentators or commentators from the ABC have commented on this whole thing, but the time is almost up.

They are planning a number of new laws coming into force in a few weeks that will literally mean you won’t be able to vote for those parties that represent you in the next election.

One of these new laws is the introduction of an independent senator who won’t have to sit on a committee and be subject to elections.

“A one hundred and ten senate nominations in a democracy is an assault on democracy,” says SCAWA, which is a privately-funded organisation that lobbies the Australian parliament to expose the government’s true agenda.

The group says if these rumours are true, then this could potentially mean that the Coalition could come into power and sweep an entire voting bloc into another election, which they’d already won by fraud, corruption and voter apathy.

The country’s highest ranking Australian left-wing thinktank, the Taxpayers Federation, have come out with their own assessment of this whole thing, saying that the two major parties have engaged in a ‘One Nation agenda’ of disenfranchising Australians.

“The way these parties are approaching this whole issue is very alarming,” said TAFE spokesman, Aaron Brown.

“It’s either that or continue on the way they are, as was the case with the Coalition government,”

“Either way, the result will be a disenfranchised electorate and a growing gulf between the rich and poor.”

Associate Professors at the University of the West are planning a major shake up of the hierarchy

TEXT:

One of the most important posts of the new academic year at the University of the West has been the number one spot for the next few weeks, it has been confirmed.

Professor Darren Sheltun (61) has reportedly announced plans to remove Professor Geronimo Carbone (67) from his position as head of the faculty.

“He’s been with us for 40 years – he’s a legend,” said one assistant dean.

“We were looking for a new headmaster for many years but he was a long way away from being a headmaster. Then Paul, Tony and I got together for lunch one day in Singapore and the moment I saw him, I knew I had to put him in the directorship,”

“I think it will be very different to what we have now. There will be more emphasis on local projects and volunteering, which is very good. The huge list of department chairs is also changing. One of the positions will become vacant. It’s not a promotion, it’s a demotion. It’s a full-time position.”

The move was met with outrage by members of the faculty, who say that they are sick of being treated like second-class citizens and are ready to fight for the right to speak their mind.

“I’m not part of a higher-order of human beings. I am a human being.” said one professor.

“No more will be given academic freedom than Paul Vautin will be given to put on the armbands of Australian football clubs.”

“Shame that’s the end of a row,” he said.

Another member of the faculty has spoken out today about the change of headmasters at the University of the West.

“It’s a step in the right direction,” said the member of the public school.

“The fall of a headmaster is a great coup for the new leader. He’ll probably go down in the history books as the man who most head-headed the university,”

“I know Darren Sheltun is a sheep, but he’s coming for the job. He’s not taking it easy, but it’s all about to get harder.”

New Study Indicates That  And E Phrase Should Be Dead

TEXT:

A new study has today concluded that the phrase ‘netball, touch football, sport’ and ‘soccer’ should all be dead, along with most of the other phrases now prevalent in modern society.

While some researchers have said the study doesn’t definitively disprove the notion that football, soccer and sport are just ‘honest games’ played between friends, the study has also concluded that the two other phrases should also be out by now, with little to no impact on the way the average punter is going to say them.

The Australian Football Association released their study into the phrase ‘honest sport’ later this week, with it already having been used to describe more than two dozen different sporting codes and competitions.

It is not yet known why it is so popular, and according to the study it’s a fair bet that it was coined in 1992, before the introduction of the internet.

However, researchers say it’s hard to say whether it was introduced into the Australian code by accident, or something that the Australian cricket board did with the new signing of the popular youth star Chris Latham.

“It seems unlikely that someone could make a conscious effort to not make it a cliché that gets repeated every game” the study said.

“But that’s all conjecture, because we didn’t see any evidence of that either. Maybe they just made it up?”

However, the Australian Football Association and Cricket Australia have both welcomed the report, saying that punters need to remember that it’s a cliché and they’ll be hearing it for years to come.

Survey: Why Sunscreen Manufacturers Don’t Sell Any More

TEXT:

An in-depth report commissioned by the Australian Bureau of Statistics has concluded that the most pervasive cause of sunspots in Australia is that people have continued to use them as a result of continued exposure to the harmful UV rays of the sun.

In addition to that, the UV rays from the sun are highly mutating, and as such, it is unsafe for anyone to wear sunscreen without a suitable filter.

This has lead to the manufacturers of sunscreens to have to look outside their industries to find ways to prevent the sun from mutating their products.

As we reported in our earlier report, on average, 95% of all sunscreens sold in Australia are the result of people being misled into thinking they have protective properties.

That statistic is also believed to have increased by almost 20% since the introduction of the ‘sunscreen everyone uses in Europe’ and ‘the US’ – Now that almost every second Australian is exposed to UV rays from the sun, it seems the market is flooded with sunscreens that people should not be using and that put them at risk of sunstroke.

That and the fact that every Australian now uses at least one type of SPF 50+ PA++ suncream in their entire lives.

The BIS report found that Australian consumers of sunscreens are responsible for the use of sunscreens that have been proven to cause sunspots in non-retardant people.

Donoghue says this sort of quiet yearning and desire for steady at least somewhat to go with his life goes hand in hand with the everyday madness he does on a daily basis.

“I just love this country. It’s the soul,” said the geologist and civil engineer.

“The country is changing. A lot of these bushies are into farming and cattle and you’ve got the climate change and bush control and all the rest. It’s the essence of our country,”

“But yeah, it’s a slow time to be alive and I’ve always been a school teacher. Even when I’m not in the classroom. I love this country.”

Donoghue’s neighbourly and laid back nature-lover fiancè, Vicky from the back, agrees with this sentiment.

She says the country is slowly becoming more and more like the old world and that Ray’s life’s a warning of what might happen if we let these slow changes in the climate affect the everyday lives of everyday people.

“My niece was a publican the other day. She spoke to me about this slow erosion in the bush. I guess you could say that it’s becoming more and more rural.”

“What could happen here?” she asked, smiling at her neighbour.

“The landscape will look like an old mining boomtown. There will be nothing left to build. It’s not like this country isn’t still standing!”

Anti-virus software says Australian’s not worthy of freedom

TEXT:

SUMMONING TO REPORT BACK ON ANTI-VIRUS PROTECTION, a prominent anti-virus software salesman from the South Betoota Apple shop told The Advocate that Australians are not worthy of the right to privacy afforded to them by our nation’s constitution.

David Maddock, who took time out of his busy afternoon of picking twigs out of the Yarra this morning to speak to The Advocate, said that the country is not ready for freedom.

“In this country, you can’t even speak our language,” he said.

“But, it’s even worse,” he said.

“That’s why I’m trying to make Australia a little bit more Australian. A little bit more free. A little bit more tolerant,”

“But it’s the same with anti-virus.”

We contacted David about his comments, to see if he was in fact worthy of the rights and freedoms afforded to him by the Australian constitution.

He was.

He told our reporters that he has a simple message for all Australians who enjoy freedom.

“I’m tired of being the slaves of the powerful,” he said.

“If you want to own a home in this country, do it to your own,”

“Get a job and get a mortgage, fuck the rest. You’ll be okay.”

Church-Funded Study Reveals Pessimism Is More Of A Mental Disorder

TEXT:

The Church has thrown its weight around the idea that the most optimistic people in society are in fact people with mental health issues, after an $84 million study was released today detailing that optimism can actually be harmful.

After spending three years of data gathering and collecting evidence from more than 20,000 people, the Church’s report concluded that pessimism is often more of a mental disorder, than an actual quality of life, and often leads to pessimistic political policies that have nothing to do with being optimistic about anything.

NSW Primary School students are today enjoying what many consider to be a momentous day, as the worst numbers of students ever seen.

The Last Australian That Killed A USA Hero Is Glenda Jackson’s Mother

TEXT:

In the wake of the untimely death of a member of the Australian military this week, many people are asking what is wrong with the nation, as well as the world.

However, a prominent and heroic American has taken time out of his busy day of watching a mate’s football team lose to a foreign power, to speak to The Advocate about what happened, and why he feels American males should be held accountable for their actions.

“I guess I just feel that people who take part in the war on terror should be punished,” he said.

“I mean, I’m not one of them but I’m not blind. I understand that some people may not want to take part in a military adventure but that doesn’t mean they’re wrong,”

“I think it’s not fair to the enemy, they should be prosecuted. But, I don’t know, maybe we’ll never know. Maybe the peace on the planet will prevail and people like me will have to pay for our actions. God, I hope it doesn’t.”

“But at the end of the day, I’m tired of this war on terror bullshit. I want to go to Afghanistan, and I want to die there.”

The war on terror began on September 11, 2001, in the US with the goal of overthrowing the Taliban regime and taking out as many Afghanis as possible.

US ground forces launched their offensive into Afghanistan on March 9, 2001, to remove the Taliban regime and restore a strong central government that would lead to greater central government and better governance.

The war came to an end on December 11, 2014, after the Taliban were defeated and Afghanistan was transferred to the Afghan government.

Turnbull Responds To Absurdity Of Media Reporting By Suggesting That God’s Answers Are Gluten-Free

TEXT:

With the Prime Minister of Australia on the verge of losing his re-election, his surprise announcement that the Great Barrier Reef is actually a lifeless shell of what it used to be is almost too funny.

While visiting the coast from his native Darwin, Malcolm Turnbull explained that it’s not just the fish, but the entire ecosystem.

“No, seriously. The bleaching, the dying, the dying again, and so on. That’s all” he said.

“And while it may seem hard to you to believe, I’m not making this up”

It seems that even Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull agrees that the monolith of coral and limestone in the middle of the world’s sixth largest body of water is not really a place that most people can get to unless they have a big car to park on the right of the driveway.

“And for that I’m really sorry” he said.

“I know it’s usually the case when this type of thing happens, but we’ve only just discovered the World’s Greatest Barrier Reef and it’s a pretty rough place”

“But at least we’ve found it.”

“At least that’s what I think”

“What does it all mean?”

Hip Hop Artist Attends Another Tupac-Related Party In Flush

TEXT:

US rapper, Method Man, was one of many musical guests at last year’s ‘Tupac++ World Cup Party’ that some of the nation’s leading journalists were there to cover. 

While his name may not ring true for many Australians – the truth is that this Hip Hop artist has managed to get there first and stay there. 

In fact, he’s stayed in the same city for close to a month now – and is only just waking up to himself. 

“I’ve gone to a lot of different places in this country. Perth is one of my favourite places,” explained the Australian-born rapper in the 'chatroom. 

“And I’ve done a lot of great things in my career. But, I’ve done them all without the help of a Twitter account.” 

“But yeah, I went to a good time.” 

“Not like this.” 

The Advocate reached out to a number of Method Man’s mates in Perth but none were willing to comment.

Phil Taylor Throws Another Private School Student In The Back

TEXT:

With all of his apparent post-graduate difficulties, New Farm-native Phil Taylor believes it was worth making a trip down to the nearby Royal College Of The Sea to throw a private school student in the back of the car for the Saturday morning run.

“He’s running, mate,” said Taylor, who was last seen just a few metres behind the KCG bus up the beach. “Sco-Mo and I got him in the car, of course I had to have a coffee with him. But yeah, he’s a good kid and a good person. Good bloke, aye?”

“When I was at Royal College, I thought I was a bit crazy, aye. I mean, I didn’t even know who I was. So, I had the car to the Royal College Of The Sea on the way down to the surf club. Anyway, there I was out on the deck of the boat ramp, playing the Whistler with some mate’s parents, when I looked out the back of the car and saw this little fella on the fenced-off area.”

After a short chat, Taylor took the fenced-off area back to the car and poured himself a small amount of Club Med in a glass of the portly gentleman’s brand.

Speaking candidly, Taylor’s parents explained to The Advocate that they’re happy that he’s being such a gentleman.

“Yeah look,” said one parent. “But just to let him know that I’m happy to be his guardian angel, I’ve also put that little shim in for the footy team down the track, too. He’s out for himself, in my opinion. You’d be all right too if you knew what you were doing.”

Police Investigate House Party Scene At Yassmin Abdel-Magied’s Parental Bedroom

TEXT:

Emergency services were called to a house party on the Gold Coast overnight where it is believed the party was rocked by a powerful element of family and friends.

The original source of the drama was Yassmin Abdel Magied, a Palestinian-Australian woman who used to be married to Saudi Prince Khalid Bin Sultan, a prominent member of the family of Saudi Arabia’s King Salman, and a hostess at a local middle-class black tie event.

Local reporters, most of whom are Arab, reported that a large party, largely dominated by Yassmin’s music, was turned into a chaotic cacophony of excitement by the arrival of Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Salman – who was in town to pay a visit.

The parties then turned into a double dissolution, one group of friends and family from the neighbourhood decided to stay until 3am, while another group made the decision to stay past their house party until close of day.

After learning of the party, many of the partygoers decided to call the organisers and ask them to reconsider their invitation, because of the several, systemic ills that were present in the local community – including widespread drug and alcohol abuse, no real sports and no real Muslim or Arab culture, the organisers withdrew the invitation.

Mayor, Councillor and senior figures from both the NSW Police and NSW Police Force all rose to their feet to try and appease the growing commotion and the perception that this wasn’t a one-off event.

“We ask you not to pull any punches here” stated the Mayor.

“Please don’t give us any reason to believe that you won’t have a good time. Just make sure you come here again if you are thinking about having a bit of fun”

“Trust us, we don’t want any of these undesirables back here”

“If you have a weekend away, then you are an utter fuckhead”

Local developer unhappy with Pennywise’s choice of footwear

TEXT:

Conor Larochelle, the lead developer of the stunning new Perth waterfront site, says he was sick and tired of hearing Pennywise and his band make music in the park.

“When they were playing The Beatles, you’d believe it was back in the 70s,” says the 48-year-old father of three.

“It’s fucked up, mate. It’s fucked up that I’m getting a pair of leotards for Christmas and fucking a man in a suit on the weekends,”

Mr Larochelle says he’s still not a fan of the band’s music.

“My son was a real pain in the arse when he was a teenager. He was spending all day in the park with us playing nothing but the worst possible music. It’s not my style, it’s just not my cup of tea.”

Despite the fact that he now has a decent business, the serial-pharmaceutical-major says he still struggles with the idea of music festivals.

“They are turning us into a fucking private school. But for fuck sake. We’ve got taxidermy here in Perth, I love Perth, why do they hate music so much?”

“I Know You”: Wife Wants You To Know How Bad Things Are

TEXT:

Husband’s friend Diane Weinheim has finally come round to the truth, she says.

“I know you,” says husband Paul to his friend Francis who is still trying to talk himself out of the feeling that the wife he married nine years ago probably had an affair with another man.

“Look, I know these days. I know what happened. All those years of being the little fella who could get up to no good,”

“I just think it’s important to you know how bad things were,”

It is believed that at the time of the interview, Diane was still thinking about how good things could have been if she hadn’t been so easily swayed by her husband’s strong opinions and agenda.

“He’s done a great job keeping me honest this time,”

“He was right about this whole affair thing,”

While Diane was content that he knew her husband for who he was, it was until recently that he learned that this man wasn’t a bad guy, but a man who was becoming a problem.

“He keeps trying to say he’s doing it for her, or for me, or whatever.”

“He’s not being honest with me or the entire family,”

Diane says that while she’s not a masochistic woman, she’s very much a feminist.

“Look, I’m just saying… Look at the clock. He’s got to be honest. I’m not having it.”

It is also believed that while Diane likes a husband who has a sense of humour, she also likes men that are very bad at football.

“They’re men, they’re not women. They’re the real men. They are not going to be good for me or our family,”

“I think you need to be a man.”

Uni Student Who Said ‘Yea’ Was To Yours: “Mate, It’s UnAustralian

TEXT:

A local student who is also named as Matt Watson, says that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders are ‘un-Australian’.

The Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement has come under fire today for citing this one-in-100 young man as their rallying cry, despite the fact that he has no association with any of the organisations they are supposedly protesting against.

The young man, who is also listed as one of the co-founders of a prominent group called ‘Coloured Chicks For Fun And Profit’, says that he has had to learn the most important lesson of all: ‘the baby blues’.

Watson, who is also a member of the pre-schools in his suburb’s predominately white inner-north, says he has been a consistent defender of the highly charged comments made by his Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander mates, for years.

“Not all Torres are black” he said.

“Not all Torres are black. And the same goes for all the black people who do not wear hoodies… There’s no such thing as white skin”

“If there is a club that wants to come and try and take my white skin, it’s unAustralian. It’s unAustralian. It’s unAustralian. It’s unAustralian.”

As Watson points out, there is quite a wide spectrum of skin colour in Indigenous and Torres Strait Islanders, it is mostly comprised of freckled and semi-nude skin, a sign of the times that they are no longer considered human.

However, despite these obvious flaws, the young man insists that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders have much in common with those around the nation who claim to be anti-racist, despite the fact that many of them have absolutely no tangible ties to any specific movement or cause.

“There’s quite a bit in common between the black Panthers and the Woolworths boycott” he said.

“The same goes for the Maori and Rugby League boycott”

“It’s like there’s a racial component to all these movements, unlike the Modern Language Association, which is mostly just a bunch of white kids who wear button-up shirts with hoops on the front.”

“And no, I’m not one of them. So you’ll never find me on their side.”

Rugby Australia’s Technical Director Jason Robinson outlines Rugby Australia’s new sponsorship deal with Budgy Smugglers

TEXT:

Former Rugby Australia CEO, Jason Robinson, has today unveiled the new sponsorship deal with Budgy Smugglers.

This comes after the Wallabies captain, who played a big role in the success of Budgy Smuggler, revealed his plans to throw the gauntlet down to Australian consumers.

The new Budgy Smugglers advertisement will appear in every state, territory and federal election campaign for the next few weeks.

“I can’t wait to show them off to the next generation” Robinson said.

“I’m excited to show them the small-state-small-business-market-as-a-key-to-enterprise-relief-bill-faa.

“The consumer has spoken, so I’m going to deliver on my promise to help them again”

“Our new Budgy Smugglers ad will be one of the first commercials that will feature a barista”

“The barista, the sound of their new sound system and all the tools they used in the game of rugby”

The new commercial comes as Australia’s not-so-subtle racist issue is a key issue of the election campaign. With the Shooters, Fishers, Fishers And Shells (SHIFA) calling for an immediate ban on the sale, service and importation of Budgy Smugglers.

This issue has been taken as a chance to unite the wider Australian rugby community, with the iconic players and captains backing their anti-Mosman black Labrador.

Although it’s hard to tell what the final product will look like, it’s believed the club will be keen to get the warring parties to work towards a solution.

Sydney Barista Makes Adorable Joke About Getting Paid In Bitcoin After Realising No One In The World Likes Bitcoin

TEXT:

Some might say it’s simple humour, but for Sydney barista Ashley Pascoe (34) it’s a pretty serious investment.

“It makes you want to give up a standard of living for a period of time.”

The easy choice of words, but serious investment.

It was a well-received joke that led him to get the idea that there would be a blockchain in the near future, and that the value of bitcoin would go through the roof.

“And I was right, people did love bitcoin,” he said.

“But they’re not going to fork on their national currency. And I didn’t want to leave Sydney, so I decided to go on a bit of a limb and think there’d be a blockchain in the near future.”

“Plus I’m getting paid in bitcoin because that makes me a nightmare partner for any of these dumb banks, so I’ve got to keep everyone happy,” he explained.

While he doesn’t mind being paid in bitcoin, the cool cryptocurrency that has caused a dip in the market, he says it’s not for him.

“Of course, I’d like to keep the value of bitcoin high,” he explained.

“I’d like to see my bitcoin price at it’s peak, like at it’s peak it was at it’s peak. But what I find funny is that people always put down their bitcoin when they’re younger,” he said.

“They come to work in the morning and think it’s a luxury to be able to buy a nice suit and a new AK47 for example, but they don’t realise that the market is volatile and in some cases it’s just a mug”

But if he thinks his cynical lifestyle is being funny, then he’d be in a bit of a pickle, according to his colleagues.

Sydney barista Leigh Sales is considered one of the most influential people in Sydney’s newly created crypto community.

“It’s a good thing, you know,” he said.

“It’s keeping the community fresh, the fact that we don’t have bitcoin at all on average, or any other cryptocurrency at all, is a bit hard to swallow.”

Actress Arrives At Harry’s Hair Loss Surgery After Discovering Himself To Have Cut His Hair Off

TEXT:

In some breaking news, Anna Faris has today confirmed that she’s finally arrived at Harry’s hair loss surgery after discovering herself to have cut her hair off at the same time.

After years of poor hair condition and a high loss, Anna says she’s finally arrived at the treatment centre where she’s spent her entire life dreading going to.

After years of yelling at the barber to “cut her hair off,” Anna says she’s finally at the treatment centre where she’s spent her entire life dreading going to.

“I went to those shitty boarding schools from the time I was 12 years old. All the kids in their raw end,” says the young mother of two.

“But that’s why I always hated my hair. It makes my scalp look greasy and it always looks greasy whenever I step on it,”

“I was going to have it done when I turned 25, but I got scared and bought some cuticle scissors at a local drug store.”

“I hate my hair, but that’s because I grew it and I didn’t grow it to give my skin a glorified nickel-arena haircut,”

“But I’ve arrived at the treatment centre where I’m going to have my hair cut.”

And to the relief of those close to the family, Anna says that this isn’t the first time she’s come to this place.

“The older I get, the more I look for my reason to come here. They’ve been called many things over the years.”

“They’ve changed,”

“The hair I’m going to have will be so much longer and thick. I don’t even care about looking good in that new T-shirt. I just want to be happy with the way my body looks now.”

Swirlie Pull-Apart Skateboards Into Heaven By Working It All The Time

A certain quiet section of the Australian surfing community is in mourning this week after a local man’s he’s always been on a mission to take a job that only exists because he’s always wanted one.

“It’s just so important for me to be doing my job,” he said. “People say to me all the time, ‘Can you think of a better job?’ I can’t really get away with going up on a boat the time, you know what I mean?”

So this afternoon, Jayden Banks, the founder of the Surfie Hubs surfing club in Betoota’s Old City district, explained to The Advocate that there’s a lot of things he likes to do on his off hours.

“Sometimes, I won’t even go to the pub,” he said. “They’d be racking and back to back. That’s not my style. I like to be doing stuff in my spare time.”

When asked by our reporter this afternoon if there’s any limits to his hobby of half-shaved head wax, the popular part time surfer said he’s trying not to get too far away from his Brisbane bff and his surf club.

“Yeah I dunno, you know, I’m just trying to get my life together, you know? For people like me,” he said.

“People say to me, ‘Jayden, you know how far you go, you just keep going. You can’t tell anybody. You can’t say you’re doing a job for it. You’re not doing it to get rich,’ but they’re just lying to me,”

“So I don’t know. I just don’t go near the surf clubs and pubs at night, that’s for sure. But I do get some good times at the surf shop, where I get a good deal more than people. I got a decent deal this morning, but. Maybe if I got a job in the surf shop.” he said.

National Party Finds It Illegal To Admit Syrian Asylum Seekers To Any Government Agency

TEXT:

The National Party has been criticised today for admitting that the party is in possession of two passports for Syrian asylum seekers, one of which is invalid and one that’s expired.

The revelations come as the opposition continues to investigate the eligibility of the two Syrian asylum seekers who were processed at the Nauru detention centre in Manus Island over the summer – one of them has a small chip implanted in his DNA, another got his fingerprints and thumb-print tattoos and another was declared a possible danger to the community after we found pictures of him on Instagram with the caption “Not sure if this is worth the paper it’s printed on”

At the centre of the controversy is the Nauru detention centre, which is not currently a detention centre for anyone, except for refugees and asylum seekers. The detention centre has been in the National Party’s cross-hairs of late because it’s been used as a centre for asylum seekers who are still struggling to establish the best interests of their asylum seeker children in a country that they are unable to send their kids to.

Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has today revealed that while he knows the Nauru detention centre is currently a disaster for the Australian taxpayer, he has yet to receive any advice on what should happen with these people, because he’s not a taxpayer.

“I am not aware of any government agency that accepts these people” he said, in a phone call to our newsroom in Canberra.

“Anybody, it seems, that has a banking sector that is susceptible to abuse in the current political climate, but I haven’t heard much about the National Party’s past human rights abuses and civil liberties violations,”

“Not to mention the ongoing cover up of sexual crimes committed against children, but if anyone has been calling me at this number, please let me know.”

The conversation then became private and Barnaby Joyce asked Malcolm to press on, because he’s got a surprise in store for him if Barnaby doesn’t, because his old man is out in the bush, just outside the Green Mountains, and he’s been asking him to come along to his house for dinner every night for the past 12 years.

New Yorkers Unaware There Is A Bay Area On They’re Entering

TEXT:

Without even looking, all four of the new ‘iconic’ features that made the Bay Area great in the 2000’s have been found.

After digging their heels in for over a decade, it is now very clear that the Bay Area is no longer just one of the nation’s most liveable, it is also the most expensive.

That, as well as the fact that they have a well-educated and vibrant culture, that will get them through the toughest times of times, one that has seen a high rate of youth homelessness, drug use, high property prices and, unfortunately, a rapid decline in sexual violence.

So as the Mayor and the Minister of Transport, Polly Trottenberg, remind us, prepare to go your whole way.

While the Bay Area is the dream of many a Sydney or Melbourne born and raised, the Bay Area also offers many opportunities for a first time home buyer.

In fact, over 90% of Bay Area residents say they would never, ever consider buying a home in a suburb that they have never been to, just to see what it is like to live in a town that they never saw as a child.

The five most expensive areas of the Bay Area

1. Mercer Island. The apple-picker capital of the Northern Riversharks.

2. Mossman. The clapped-out rambler and river-chaser, Mt Coot-tha-low-key.

3. Monkton. The most fashionable mid-level chief-of-staff and teacher at the exclusive, cosmopolitan and cosmopolitan hub of the harbour city.

4. Tame Impala. The most exclusive and honest cut of shag carpet.

5. Mosman. The most exclusive and honest cut of shag carpet found in the deep south.

6. Kings Cross. The hottest housing market in the eastern suburbs.

7. Toowoomba. The most exclusive and honest cut of shag carpet found in the deep south.

8. Woollahra. The most fashionable inner-city gay suburb.

9. Woollahra. The most fashionable inner-city gay suburb.

10. Mosman. The most fashionable middle-class adult entertainment centre in Australia.

Local ABC Man Not That Intelligent

TEXT:

A former guest on NewsCorp’s Q&A programme said he doesn’t really know much about journalism – and he says that he’s always been a bit more put together than the rest of his cohort.

He told The Advocate that he often does more reading online than the rest of his group when he’s home in Sydney’s Southern district.

All in an effort to avoid the 'gotcha questions' that scare him and his friends out of the house, local ABC host Jeff Baigler says he doesn’t really know much about journalism, aside from the huge salary and glamorous lifestyle that comes with it.

“Some people are just dumb,” said Jeff.

“Not to worry myself, but yes, I do think a fair bit of journalism is something you can do while you go about your day,”

“At least not in the sense that you’re putting together a news story or a profile. I’d advise you to do that when you’re living under a rock or something. It’s not much.”

But, he conceded, some people are more suited to journalism than others.

One example of this was former ABC host Lachlan Markay, who told The Advocate that he’s much more at home in journalism than journalism.

He worked as a reporter for The Sydney Morning Herald before becoming the evening news and current affairs specialist at the ABC.

“I’ve got more journalism in me than just reporting on whatever comes into my head at any given time,” said the 29-year-old.

“I’ve written about four or five profiles about the best people in the country who don’t do journalism and have more of a social conscience than most people have,”

“I’ve got a tough job but at the end of the day, I love journalism. It’s the real thing, the ABC.”

Lunch With The Stars Roundtable Started With A Bit Of Dubsmash

TEXT:

While the fruitless recent debate over the merits of a true Australian springtime feast has been well and truly lost, a new crop of seasonal Tablelands are now looking good, even if they are a tad unrefined.

The new tablelands are actually more reminiscent of a classic football/rugby cup team, which is what most young couples nowadays would describe as ‘A bit Country’.

This comes as an increasingly secular and white wedding with an emphasis on family values and community cohesion.

The lack of religious and community symbols today for any reason could be attributed to an increasing tendency towards the Country/Western world multiculturalism that is going hand in hand with a lack of political correctness in many of the instances where they have been actually doing it to begin with.

So who can blame them?

“This is Australia,” stated the Country/Western premiers, shuffling aside the fact that all of their Country/Western leader was a full-on atheist who believes in natural disasters and is apparently an acquaintance with a local biker gang that half his mates now are in love with.

“So yeah, this year we are gonna have a bit of Dubsmash and some BBQ!” 

“Yiay! Yeehaw!”

“Aww fuuuuckkk!”

A number of the premiers were then heard to say ‘but’ followed by an awkward pause before the inevitable ‘but don’t’ after being asked if they wanted to go to any of the places in the country where people like that have been.

Science Considers Scavenging The Dog Meat Supplements To Pay For A Synapse Reconstruction

TEXT:

Following a recent study of pre-food trends in Queensland’s central coast, scientists from Australia’s peak scientific body have today revealed their final plan to save the lives of hundreds of thousands of pet dogs currently locked inside cage fires.

The rise of this radical weather pattern has got scientists worried that their ongoing experiments may have slipped past the usual closure times, and are now spreading to nearby grassland and wetlands.

That’s why the CSIRO have today begun scouring the many thousands of veggie burgers that have become popular in recent years in the wider public.

“It is very difficult to be sure what’s behind this” said CSIRO spokesman, Professor Craig Steven.

“As the seasons change and the dogs begin to get the same daily feed, the same shade. As the surface water levels go down, the water levels go up. And this is what’s happening”

“When the surface water reaches the depth of the grey duck, it starts to boil”

“This brings the surface water up to the surface, where it is decompressing, and that’s what’s going on”

“The CSIRO is working closely with local farmers to make sure this doesn’t happen, and that the water levels don’t go down as much, because it’s a very expensive two-week job”

“We’ll keep an eye on this situation as it develops. And when we hear back from the farmers, we’ll let them know that we’ve been scouring their land for the last few months, and the most expensive way to get the same food as the farmers can afford,”

“At the end of the day, what we want is a quick fix for our deep-seated agreed-to climate change, that’s all.”

Report: Mozzie Robot Never Tastes Pepperoni Pizza, So Just Eat That Shit

TEXT:

A recent report by the CSIRO has found that Pepperoni pizza is the least healthy option on offer at any supermarket, restaurant or pub.

This comes as a growing number of Australian cities are going without meat and/or dairy in their pizzas, with some even opting for no meat at all.

However, the CSIRO has found that if you eat a mozzie robot pizza, it’s as healthy as eating a Sticksie, but without all the gluten and gluten-containing toppings.

In a new report commissioned by the CSIRO in partnership with the Australian Public Health Association, the team looked at the options available from supermarkets, restaurants and bars, as well as other places where you would expect to find pizza.

That led them to the conclusion that Pepperoni pizzas are the most likely to be labelled as ‘high gluten’ or ‘high gluten dairy’ depending on your dietary needs.

“What we found was that if you eat a pepperoni in a supermarket, it’s probably as safe as eating a Sticksie, but if you eat it at a restaurant, you should probably eat it like a fish,” said lead researcher, Professor Chris Schultz.

“The same goes with pub pies, you can’t really trust a pub pie if you eat it at a pub, so just eat a mozzie,”

“At this point, I’m not sure what it is, it’s just a bit of mozzie sausage that you can eat raw,”

NRL Integrity Unit Investigation Finds Low Scores On Players' Clothing Not Indicate Player Was Going To Play At The Night

TEXT:

The NRL Integrity Unit has today launched a two-year investigation into the conduct of players at a suburban All Stars game. The Unit followed up on a number of complaints made by several alleged NRL stars during the match, after a number of players failed to turn up at their respective players are white shirts.

The NRL Integrity Unit is an independent investigation arm of the NRL, working within the organisation to identify, investigate and punish any misconduct by the game. The unit was set up in 2006 to provide support and counselling for former players and players staff.

The first result was the emergence of several players having white shirts, which the unit believed was indicative that the players were intending to ‘go big or go home’. The unit also became aware that some players had taken the flag with them to different areas of the game, where they had not returned. Their first complaint was made to the NRL Integrity Unit at around 3:30 pm.

After their investigation, the NRL announced their findings that several players had provided evidence that they were not playing with a rugby league flag or flag bag, and had some alcohol/drug-related problems to resolve.

In December 2013, the NRL announced the decision to suspend the players for six years without pay, until at least 9 March 2019.

“For the first time in a long time, I am very happy with the way the players went about it.” Berties said in a statement.

“I think you’ve got enough here. The lowest number of drugs were used, but still. One player was found with a box of ecstasy, which was purchased on a whim. That’s not very normal behaviour.”

Dolphin Ain’t Hot Enough To Consent To Intercourse With Child Pornographers

TEXT:

A dolphin that is currently being used as a sex toy has been handed over to authorities by the Department of Conservation and Parks and Wildlife.

This comes after the incident is confirmed to be the most venomous thing since the Pontiac Firebird.

The decision has been met with outrage amongst conservationists, who say that it’s appalling that the animal was captured for no good reason other than being cool.

It’s being estimated that the 90,000+ bottlenose dolphins currently in captivity around the world will be killed this year, and their remains will be sold for scrap to impoverished Chinese fishermen, who can’t afford to purchase a kilo of ivory for their zoo.

However, a dolphin that’s already been abused so badly, by the environmental lobby and the animal rights movement – means that it’s no longer suitable for entertainment.

The Dolphin is currently at the bottom of its pleasure zone, after being switched off by real-life sexual deviancers, who say it’s an absolute fucking bonafide no-no.

The recent study has found that the dolphin is most receptive to stimulation from a penis pointed at it, but the dolphin is also capable of being turned off by an erection.

“I Don’t Get Why All The Horsies Just Hate Us” Says Aboriginal Person

TEXT:

A notorious Abbottista has today lashed out at his Aboriginal brethren for making such an obvious assumption about him.

This comes as Abbott accuses his own brother and three cousins of being “racist bigots” – an accusation that any male Aboriginal in that family will immediately disown – even if it means he has to stab them.

But for Allan, and his extended family, this isn’t about race – this is about survival.

“It’s not about race, it’s about identity” Allan says.

“I don’t get how people can treat a person like that,”

The 45-year-old former civil engineer says that because he’s Aboriginal, and white, he has to be a racist.

“Why can’t Aboriginal people just accept that their culture and history end up on the wrong side of history, and that Aboriginal people are racists?”

“I’ve had enough of this left-wing shit,”

“Let’s just say I hate white people”

As far as he’s concerned, a man who identifies as Aboriginal is not a racist – as long as he gets to live with one of them.

As many Aboriginal people, and non-Aboriginal people in general, claim to have experienced, in their daily lives, a number of “tragic slips and slides”, Allan says he’s seen his whole community come to terms with his white cousins black skin and brown hair.

“I don’t get it. They look like animals. They are just animals. They’re just animals.”

However, the feelings of inferiority and fear that his black mates feel towards them as Aboriginal white men, come in part because they are Aboriginal white men.

“It’s like they’re asking us to trust them because they look like a wild animal,”

“It’s not a very good look.”

Attorney-General warns Malcolm Turnbull if he doesn’t get his way on social media – people won’t start clicking on memes

TEXT:

In a rare example of an apathetic parliament, the Attorney-General of Australia has today thrown the gauntlet down to the PM by saying he’s got a life to live and he’s got a duty to live it.

Peter Dutton, the outgoing Prime Minister who was a huge supporter of the racist Australian far-right movement, has surprised many by announcing that he doesn’t really like the memes he gets his countrymen to click on.

The Attorney-General’s comments came as the Prime Minister began to publicly question the role the federal government’s social media advisors play in generating online memes.

In a letter to the Daily Telegraph, Mr Dutton attacked the "unreliable" and “unindependent” media organisations for allowing content which is “offensive” to view the public.

“In this day and age, the only thing that makes for news is a lack of context, which is why there is no context in this day and age.”

“I would like to make it clear that I am of the view that no one should be censored.” wrote the Attorney-General.

“The Murdoch press is as apathetic as the Murdoch corporations and what they do is, and always has been, offensive, which I will never be able to say or believe.”

He also made an overt reference to the chlamydia – also called ‘chlamydia by its older, non-Australian, female-sounding name.”

There has been widespread condemnation of the Attorney-General’s comments – with the ‘Lol Cambi’ meme being the most common online representation of the toxic establishment.

However, as this is a rare case where Australians want to link memes, it has been confirmed that this meme is not offensive.

Local Drummer Says He’s Not Sure Why He’s Playing So Hard

TEXT:

Local drummer, Adam Pettiford, says he just doesn’t know why he’s playing so hard.

After a few long years in the game, the casual music fan says he’s had it up to here with some of the girlie fellas and their macho vibe.

Adam says his attitude towards music and art has been unquenchable for a while now, but he says his desire to play the gimpish snare drum in an inner city club is a bit odd.

“It’s not the reason I’m playing this much, it’s just that it’s the most interesting thing to me right now”

“You know, when I’m actually in a club, I might wanna get a little nudge with some of the boys, cause I’ve got a bit of poo down”

“Like, I just don’t think it’s fair to lump all my music into a few genres and not give me a chance to explore my own stuff”

It’s believed Adam’s interest in music comes from his love of 70s Americana bands like Heartbreak Hill, which are very similar to some of his current influences, but his lack of a musical background is what draws him to these songs.

“I just don’t get it, I don’t even like old people”

“I mean, my dad was a big pop star in the 70s and I guess he was a big music fan too. But I just think there’s a bit of a disconnect when it comes to this country”

With the release of his fifth studio album Tomorrow Now It Depends, expect to hear some completely bizarre and off-the-cuff music by Adam soon.

A social commentator with an Arizona State of Origin ring on his finger says the LGBTI community need to get used to the idea of self-censor and create a safe space for them to complain about things like this, because they’ve worked hard for it.

Graham Quirk, an independent political commentator, says the past few months have seen the social justice warriors (SJWs) take over universities and schools, with everything from deconstructionist gender theory to white-supremacist nationalism, using every tool at their disposal to silence ideas that threaten to damage their cherished conservative family values.

“It’s OK to be gay, it’s OK to be a black man. It’s OK to be Muslim, it’s OK to be an undocumented immigrant, it’s OK to be a woman. They don’t care,” says Graham as he flicks through his Twitter newsfeed.

“Just as long as you have a way with words,”

“If you speak my language, some of these people will listen.”

This comes as Senator Malcolm Roberts said the country has “gone soft”, citing a recent study conducted by the Australian Catholic University which found that nearly 80% of all tertiary education in Australia is now funded entirely through student fees.

“I Can’t Wait For The Christmas Cry For Next Year” Says Mum

A poll by the ABC has found that people across the country are waiting for next year’s Christmas to be the hottest that they’ve ever seen it.

As the temperature warms this Christmas, many people in the country are looking for the coldest possible temperature to feel the chill in their bones and dry out their hair.

The hottest temperature that the nation has ever recorded was 51.6C at Cloncurry, on 8 December 1970. A full week before Christmas.

It’s taken the world away from us that coldest temperature ever recorded, but this year the odds are stacked in our favour.

Over a hundred days of constant chilling.

For the Christmas and New Years holiday the nation will be feeling like their skin is melting off, but for each day off the road, only the most stubborn of the nation’s tough.

It’s a season that may require a bit of courage – but not to push your luck.

Local Betoota woman, Lucy Moloney (46) says if her husband can’t go to the pub then she can go too, and if that means he can’t wear his favourite pyjamas then he can wear his worst work attire.

“I don’t care if he’s wearing cargo shorts or down with a T-Shirt, he doesn’t need to wear them. And if he’s even wearing cargo for the night, it’s probably not just a poor morning for him. If he goes out and is wearing them, I am not buying them for a reason. He’s obviously got no value,”

“A little bit of courage, perhaps, but not when you’re in a room full of people reading the news, you’ve got to fucking back down when you’ve got a little bit of courage,”

“It’s just a bit more difficult than it seems to be going out for a short holiday,”

Local student, Alex Schroeder (16) says he loves being a cheap shot, and he’s looking forward to getting the hang of getting home in time for dinner.

The statement was in reference to a recent interview with The Advocate regarding the career of the Member For Macauley-Mercury.

“It was my understanding that the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles are currently in the bottom 10 and are currently just one win away from the finals, and that’s essentially not important enough to mention on the #AFLStats.”

The tweet was later deleted, but it was not deleted because it was traced back to a Malcom article published on The Betoota Advocate’s Twitter page in October of 2015.

“He’s a big fan of Steve,” said one former colleague.

“He’s very involved in rugby union, which is basically the most popular sport in Australia, but he’s not a rugby fan. He’s a huge St. Kitts fan, he’s probably going to be on the sidelines for the impending match-up against the Blacktown Ponds Mardi Gras team at Mount Shatter.”

The national pride movement has announced today that it will continue in its quest to reach the entire nation as the country waits for some sort of civic gesture of a government to issue the iconic ‘R.I.P.S.E.  flag, which is what the party is officially known as.

The Rainbow Shopping Cart movement began in Sydney and is spread across the country as a way to show support for the community by a particular demographic, as well as a change.

While many will argue the movement is a more overt expression of progressive politics, the constitution and the wider Australian public, many with very diverse sensibilities – as well as quite a bit of criminal convictions – have made it a focal point in recent months.

As was proven last time we had the situation in Newcastle. It is not hard to have a face to face with the youth.

“The first year it was a bit hard to get away from the gutter and into the right places, but I got there” said Fiona MacDougall, a Brisbane mother of four.

“I have been in a space where I have never been before.”

Antisocial Hillside Monk Refuses To Fill Up Your Carpark With All The Boring Safety Standards

TEXT:

A hillside half-forgotten monk has today demonstrated that he is able to prevent the world from continuing to be a laughingstock by refusing to fill up your carpark with hundreds of safety standards, including car park rules.

This comes as Vale Roi’s notorious (to those in the community) car park getaway from another community park goes down the tubes, and he has today admitted that he wouldn’t have walked through the gates if it wasn’t for the safety pins he was put through the metal gate.

The 23-year-old Clermont street child has today been found in full-on, topless, green-buttoned nautica with a gold chain, and a bunch of gang members, who stopped him from doing it.

Despite a stern warning not to walk through the gates, when the park was full and the alarm clock was ringing, Roi says he figured he wouldn’t have to be that close to the community that didn’t want to see him.

“Ok, this is a bit of a bad walk, but I just have to have a quick little trip around to get the finish, and this car park is perfect,” Roi says.

“I was supposed to be driving in to the community park for the races, but the family had already decided that was in full,” he says.

“So I thought I’d go there for a bit of a break.”

“Not to much of a break, but you know what happens when you drive into the country!”

“So I stopped in to pick up some free gas for my late model Hyundai i40, and pulled up a short time before the gates closed,” he says.

“And that’s all I was supposed to do. The other park was full of car park rangers, and the owners were only an hour away from the town so they were all waiting for me.”

“All of them.”

Mr Roi says he was actually on the way to pick up his little cousin’s new boyfriend, when the gang stopped in for a look.

“I just had to have a look at who was coming, and how safe they were,” he said.

“And we got in the car and drove to a town called Waskomay, which is about as dangerous as it gets,” he said.

“So I told the driver to pull over at the lights, and that’s how I got the keys. It’s just sad that a man like me was able to make a mistake like that.”

Federal Hopes Former Prime Minister Tony Abbott Is Happy Now A Drought Has Closed

TEXT:

The former Prime Minister Tony Abbott has today told the nation that he is happy that the current drought is behind him.

This comes as the Australian government tells parliament it is unable to meet its August budget targets for this financial year.

With the water levels in the Murray-Darling Basin Reserve currently at 798 per cent of their ideal level, the current drought is one of the last remaining bleaching events in the country.

This means that the former Prime Minister Abbott is one of the last living entities left that can still afford to fund his expensive lifestyle and not have the government support his ability to exist in some kind of elite university lifestyle.

Abbott, who is still enjoying the fruits of his time in the nation’s capital, told reporters that he’s glad the drought is over.

“I’m looking forward to spending my last days in the Murray-Darling Basin,” he said.

“It’s going to be a real treat to see it. I’ll be drinking Murray-Darling water,”

“It’s not like I’m going to stop eating there. I think it’s a pretty good place, like good food,”

Abbott then said that the drought conditions in the country will only get worse unless the political elite are made aware of what is happening.

“The system is designed to reward farmers and make it easy for them to be in a drought. It’s not designed to support people who don’t have a clue.” he said.

But just as importantly, many of us aren’t having the time to cook the Christmas meats or vegetables as they are. It’s usually the last day of a big week eating away for the weekend.

So for the holidays, we asked our editorial team to do a little bit of research into how much preparation was needed for this meal.

Instead, we received the following tips:

“Sure, you can’t do an instant mess with a McChicken,” said Australian-based restauranteur, Donna ‘Daphoney’ Manu. “But I’ve done a good number of McChicken’s and they’ve done a fine job of making them look easy and cheap. I’ve even done a one-pot deal on a Pad See Ew. This meal is pretty good.”

Donna, like many Australians, loves one-pot meals. If she’s not too hungry, she might eat a bit of her own shadow and eat the rest of the thing on the fire, but she’s not about to.

“Just don’t do it!” she says.

Brisbane Beer Shops Thrown Out Of The Good Times For Being Too Quick to Turn The Top Off

TEXT:

Brisbane Beer shops are now on notice.

According to the new ‘Brisbane Beer Shop nanny’, Brisbane Beer stores will be targeted on the street with flashing red letters, which are also the local Police Force’s preferred term for the holiday town’s ‘slowest city’.

This news comes after the new initiatives from Queensland Police has seen a 98% increase in violent assaults in bars and clubs since Queensland was taken over by Lock-Out laws in 1992.

Brisbane police have said that they will be rolling out ‘Tasers’ at pubs from tomorrow and then clubs from Friday night.

“Those clubs are the second biggest victim of this sad trend, after the fact,” said Sergeant Greg Martynan.

“We’ve also got Tasers at The Bottom Lounge, Redfern, The Black Cat, The Crown and The Plaza. From Friday at 2pm, police will be tasering the top of the Redfern Club while the bottom of the Redfern Club will be locked down,”

“The bottom of the Rockabilly Lounge will be on its way out and we’ll be arresting the likes of Edward Snowden for it,”

The taser trend’s this week comes after former Storm's football star Tyrone Roberts was arrested on the Gold Coast on suspicion of assaulting police – however, he’s due to appear at a stand-down hearing tomorrow morning.

Dying Now Australian Notification Of Suicide In Australian’s Facebook Feed

TEXT:

The age of social media, particularly Facebook, is getting younger. With many Australians starting to make the leap from analogue communication medium to the mobile first world. However, some older members of society are beginning to worry that their social media feeds may not be as current as their economic and social network is.

Graham Cullens, an 86-year-old grandfather of nine, says he’s been a diehard Facebook user for decades, and though he’s occasionally noticed something that makes him feel uneasy – he’s typically able to tell when he’s feeling sad because he looks at his Facebook feed.

“I was having lunch one day with some of my uncles on the Goldie and I noticed my photo was up there in the top right hand corner of the Facebook news feed,”

“I was pretty shocked,”

“I’ve got a real hot button one right now – it’s about the Black Lives Matter shit,”

A recent study by the American Family Association found that one in four Australians has at some point, used Facebook to talk about something that’s ‘kind of like criminal’ or ‘racist’ – a group which has lead to a rise in cases of social media suicide.

Professor Cameron Downey, the lead researcher behind the report, said that people younger than the age of 30 are the only demographic who tend to have a lot of Facebook activity.

“It’s interesting, many younger Australians like to take things a little bit more seriously than older Australians. We’re actually talking more than Australians in general,” he said.

“This is usually out of a sense of genuine sadness and frustration with society and the fact that no one else is getting a handle on the rampant racism that seems to permeate all levels of society,”

“The fact that we are constantly being bombarded by those aged below the age of 30 social media, and their complete lack of experience, is an indication that they really don’t know what the world is like,”

“However, they have a desire to help bring an end to the experiment of mass immigration and political correctness. This includes helping them get the word out about the suicides from childhood,”

“Most of the suicides we have come across so far have been suicides who are only the worst until the words get out about what they’ve done to their social groupies.”

However, as the old saying goes, the first day of March is always the hardest for anyone – even the most seasoned veterans of the Social Media Warfare.

Interior Designer Puts Cutout Of Michael Jackson As Poster For Darkroom

TEXT:

A local interior designer has today done her best to insult the legacy of one of the most iconic musicians in music history.

This comes after architect Beryl Beryl (56) revealed the interior design plans for a prominent Australian rock-designer, Michael Jackson.

Beryl explains that she has never really thought much of Michael, but after reading his work, she’s quite shocked by how well-known his image is already.

“How do you explain that to these young kids who’ve never seen a Michael Jackson poster?” she asked.

“Why do we have this pop icon now? What does he even represent?”

“Why does he need to be so much more famous than we already are?”

“Because he has become such an icon. What a fucking stupid fucking icon.”

When questioned as to why she chose to make a cutout of his head, Beryl explained that she felt like it would be quite exploitative to show the extent of his celebrity.

“I feel like it’s appropriate. I mean, I’ve never actually met Michael but I guess I’ve heard enough about him in the media to know that his head looks pretty good cut out.”

“But I can’t really be bothered making a poster for him because I want to make a real point of telling these young kids that he’s a bigger deal than the media thinks,” she said.

When it was suggested she go with the cutout of Michael Jackson’s head, Beryl said that she was just trying to go with the flow.

“I’m trying to be a smart, educated, progressive woman with an ethical compass,” she said.

“But I’m not sure. Sometimes, it just feels a bit weird and pop cultural to make cutouts of the biggest pop stars in the world.”

Matt Corby To Retire From Playing Racist Bullies After They Die

TEXT:

Former footballer and racist bullies, Matt Corby is making a last-ditch effort to stay relevant in the heated debate over race relations, after he is said to be withdrawing from the boards of prominent racist internet websites.

Following revelations that he was approached by Sydney Rooster sponsors to comment on the current issues facing Indigenous people, Matt is reportedly no longer allowed to play as a white supremacist because some of his neo-nazi mates are dying.

“It’s tragic that some of our comrades from the same webious backgrounds, have decided to end their association with us. We don’t speak for the other white kids in the country,” said Matt in a statement.

“We are offering up our full support to indigenous resistance movements around the world. More specifically, our support for movements of social and economic justice, indigenous rights and human rights.”

However, some racist and fascist internet websites are now saying that they are also leaving the Corby-headquartered-right-wing-news-media-entity, after he starts promoting white supremacist opinions and rhetoric, in his final months with the club.

But Matt says he’s not quitting.

“I’m offering full support to the resistance movements worldwide,” said the unabridged anti-Semite.

“We’ve got some great news for you. It’s coming. No more playing with naturals. No more playing with black people. There’s a new wave of white flight.”

Matt says he’s offered to comment on a number of things – including the recent controversy surrounding the Sydney Swans player, Gareth Widders.

However, his real roadblock comes from the fact that his old racist mates will no longer have him as a friend.

“I’m not one of them,” said the unabridged anti-Semite.

“I’m leaving them behind. I can’t be a white supremacist anymore. All I can do now is offer up my support for the movement,”

“I’m leaving them behind to make way for new arrivals,”

“I’m leaving Sydney in a little while, but not too soon. It’s a very delicate balancing act.”

Man doesn’t know what he’s doing, but tries to be clever

TEXT:

A funny thing happened today in the Big Apple’s South Park Street district, as two young bachelors stumbled upon a funny tattoo on a young man’s arm.

The tattoo is a familiar face to those who know the young man, as the 24-year-old tradesman from North Betoota is known to frequently tattoo mates and family.

But the more he thought about it, the more funny it all became.

The tattoo was on his right elbow, just below his elbow, next to his wrist, just above his index finger and just below his thumb.

He’s also got a pencil on his other hand, next to his pencil and the inside of his mouth.

But he’s still working in finance – which is where the idea of trying to be clever comes into play.

“I just thought he was hilarious,” said Marcus Coleman, who’s been working with the young man for about a year now.

“He’s one of those chicks that knows how to suck her hooks in, it’s her job. Anyway, I thought, hey, maybe I’ll give her a look,” said the happy-go-lucky Betoota Heights local.

“She said ‘yeah sure’ and snapped the tattoo off my arm.”

The couple then told The Advocate they were having a casual chat about the new work Marcus is doing in the tattoo parlor.

“We’re always going to have those conversations. I don’t know why I’m doing it again.” said Linda, still shiving at the prospect of seeing her boyfriend for another time.

“I’ve gotta get him tattooed again, too. But this guy looks like a real sweetie. I’ll get him one of those day,” she said.

Tony Abbott To Release Biography This Week On Details Of His 2009 Battle With Malcolm Turnbull

TEXT:

Federal Prime Minister Tony Abbott has today revealed his record-breaking personal battle with Malcolm Turnbull, which saw the two of them battle it out for the leadership of the Liberal Party.

This comes as the PM is under fire for not only ignoring numerous calls for him to be sacked, but for not saying enough about his plan for the nation’s young people.

“I have a lot of explaining to do, I’m dying!” he roared.

“For one, I don’t want to get elected. I don’t even want to be an MP. But for two, I have a real problem with Malcolm Turnbull. It all comes down to that Mal, because he’s a Mal, and as Mal as me, as the son of a Mal,”

“So yeah, it’s all a lot more complicated than you think. But yeah, I’ve gotta get this done,”

Abbott’s record battle with Malcolm Turnbull has been well documented, with a number of upcoming commemorative albums and documentaries on the side.

However, the most recent memoir, An Intimate Portrait Of Malcolm Turnbull, has reportedly spruiked his love for the democratic process.

“How about this, this is how we get things done, not by voting in a few men and women from outer-inner-southern-suburbs,” he wrote.

“Secondly, how about this, a lot of my ideas come from Peter Dutton. He’s the kind of conservative who thinks Peter Dutton is a crook bloke. But Malcolm Turnbull is from the same generation as Peter Dutton, which is a real geezer,”

“And then you’ve got your works of art, mate.”

Mother Donating Child’s Specimen Of Soul To An Age From Childhood

TEXT:

The plight of the poor is the eternal struggle of mankind. They are the collateral damage of unbridled capitalism.

A recent report has found that in 2017 alone, over 5 billion dollar value of donated organs have gone missing.

It was believed that a staggering amount of organs had been taken out of the hands of people who had the ability to give, but were unwilling to give their organs.

The Liberal Party and the Liberal Party of Australia have today offered their congratulations to the families and the wider humanitarian community, and it’s understood that this year’s budget is making things much easier.

The Minister For Health and a number of prominent ministers from the Coalition have offered their condolences on behalf of the wider Liberal family.

The Advocate reached out to the Minister for Health’s office for comment, however, our reporter heard back from the Minister For Education and an individual in the ministry’s HR department, who said the news was ‘horrifying’ and ‘unacceptable’.

However, The Advocate could confirm that if you ask them what they’d like to donate, they’d happily sell a piece of their own soul for a nice cool new car.

However, as our readers are quite fond of commenting, the children of wealthy people, the opportunity to donate their soul for some fun stuff is very tempting.

But first, we reached out to the Liberal Party for comment.

In a short statement issued on the eve of the State Of Origin, the Liberal Party of Australia has expressed their sympathy with the Sinclare family for what they’ve done to their own son, Adam.

“It’s just disgusting, and yet deeply admirable,” read the statement.

“The Sinclare family’s decision to sell their unborn son to a very perverted and perverted looking man, for some new junk is not only morally wrong but illegal – and that’s before we get to the footy.”

“We’ve always had a bad habit of lending too much money to people who need the money the most. Adam, who’s poor genetics only make him feel that way, is like a third of my total – and no one gives a shit about that. It’s the lowest point of our fallen morality.”

The Advocate reached out to Adam’s parents, both of whom declined to comment, but a number of influential Liberal backbenchers spoke to The Advocate regarding the issue as well.

One backbencher, Tony Abbott, was in town for a press conference after a particularly large and noisy rally in Canberra this morning.

“The sinclare family have broken with tradition and have offered to sell their son for a new boat,” he said.

“That’s one way of moving the issue but there’s also another, ­another, another,” he laughed to himself.

“But I’m getting ahead of myself. The one thing I’ve got going for me is that the Australian people are getting tired of the immigration. Far out! But, Jesus. They’ll do that to themselves if they don’t wake up to themselves. The idea of Australia is dying,”

“Anyway.”

More to come.

Report: Best Things In Life Are To Be, At Least, Half-Cut

TEXT:

The results of a recent report has found that some life decisions are so bold that they may have been affected by the fact that you have only ever had the best things in life.

The Advocate can reveal that the research was conducted between April and September 2016 and revealed that approximately 88 per cent of the people surveyed decided to take a hit, no matter how small, of a part of themselves to give them a clean, glossy finish.

The Advocate reached out to a number of the respondents – some of whom were in great health, others were still in great health – and all of whom agreed that they could do with a few days to change their state of mind.

One man was the scum of a state, and his clean finish went to his past, but that also made him aware of how far he was from it and what a little bit of that scratchiness can do to the quality of a person.

The man named Leon said he found himself thinking about what he said about relationships and how things hurt.

“As I was saying, I’d rather the  free, full-time-stay-at-home, fully-paid-to-support-a-sexy-single-mother-son kind of things over those —” said the man who is one of the lowest ranked expatriates on the planet.

“It’s hard to live like a free man when there’s nothing to have in common with — you need a father and a partner who understand your needs and are willing to support you in your priorities. ”

“It’s almost like they just want the man to get a tidy house and not the difficult ones to be honest, like finding a new job, or becoming a father or something, or two, or what ever it is.”

The Advocate reached out to a number of the respondents, who each answered as they stood in a fluorescent lit room in the company car park of their local jobcentre, an expensive car park for the car park for someone who can’t find a job.

When they asked their employer if they’d like to move their positions out to a cheaper area where they could find a job, they’re met with stares from men in suits and shoes.

Kids At School Back Into Year’s Just A Bite Into The Easy Bake Ovens

In some breaking news out of the town’s Old City District, the whole school has gathered for a close look at the brand new Easy Bake Ovens.

With the school holidays looming, the kids, aged 2 – 8, are cooking up an array of holiday foods in their own time.

“They’re just hours away from school!” says local teacher, Mrs Rees (82)

“They’re just seconds away from the oven!”

The Easy Bake Ovens are the world’s most popular oven and are used for a number of different things, such as, biscuits, muffins, pies, brownies, and several types of lasagne.

Mrs Rees says it’s great to see the school kids enjoying the taste of Australian made food, but that doesn’t mean she’s in a position to judge.

“As a teacher, I have a duty to tell kids to keep their yum cha out of my oven” she says.

“Just don’t throw a bunch of yum cha in there for the record, it’s not a good idea”

“They’ve cooked up some nice Christmas goodies like apple cores and a loaf of home made bread”

With Christmas just around the corner, the kids have gathered for the Daily Telegraph, to send a very public message that Australia Day shouldn’t be a date that young people should have to get behind.

Mature Age Husband Threatened With Fine If He Doesn’t Move House First

Local mature age couple, Stacey and Kevin, have experienced one of the biggest handshakes in recent memory.

As the clock strikes 11:20 pm this evening local time, it became clear that the heated argument was over.

With the 21st of May 2017, it was officially time to move Stacey’s house.

At around 11:30 pm, after close to an hour of argument, it became clear that Stacey had won.

“Stephie, you can’t you fucking move.” She yelled at Kevin, who had kept her house keys under the sink.

“This isn’t your first house move.”

Stacey’s house keys, which were left on her kitchen island, are also missing from the shed.

“Give me your keys!” She yelled at Kevin, who was slowly approaching his door.

“Shut the fuck up you fucking senile old creep!”

With these and other threats of physical conflict, Kevin and Stacey were again locked in a heated discussion, until the old bed and scratch mat went to bed.

While the argument about moving Stacey’s house became more and more heated, it ultimately paid off when Kevin moved the house keys, taking the house down stairs.

Stacey is reportedly uncomfortable about being the architect on this house move, but thinks she’s a decent enough architect to do it.

“There’s always one on the way to the manager’s office with a rather neat scroll. Nobody wants to get piss up in a man’s private car. We just work for the benefit of the shareholder!”

The sinister city worker’s voice was rapidly rising.

“As long as they don’t get piss in the car they’re absolutely the same as everyone else. We’ve been doing it for a while now. The realisation is that we’ve got a boss like Tony Schenck sitting right next to me in the boss car. Who the hell wants to piss in a man’s private car!”

Caught between two totalitarian governments, Lucy Higgins spoke to our reporters about the incredible privilege she has over her coworkers.

“I’ve got the freedom to just smoke up a guy’s private car,” she said.

“A light one is a perfect fit for this company, I’ll buy it for you and rent it for you and the boss will never find out. That’s what it means to be a man. However, the one you have with me is a red one,”

“It’s a perfect fit. I’ll pay you back for it, you know?”

“If you can keep your nose clean, you’ll get the night manager’s private car. If you can keep your nose clean, you’ll get the bus driver’s private car.

Local 22-Year-Olds Not Sure If He’s Into Teensy Thingy Stuff Or Honeymooners

Local 22-year-old aspiring junior rugby league player, James O’Hoolahan, says he’s not sure if he’s into tweed.

“I mean, it’s pretty obvious what I like – it’s the way I see it”

“The way I see it, the tweed jacket, mate. That’s my thing,” he says.

The local rugby league player and aspiring Magpies draftee says his main reason for not being into tweed is because of the cursive typeface on it.

“I dunno, mate, I think it’s pretty lame to wear cursive type on a business card. Like, who in their right mind would print that out on a business card anyway? You can’t show business cards in school”

James’ mother, Ruth, says that she’s made it quite clear to him that he doesn’t belong in threes.

“We don’t know what you’re into. Why do you think my husband is into Honeymooners? Because he’s also into Honeymooners, as well”

“It’s funny you would think because he has such a large collection of leather goods, but I’m into Honeymooners. But no, he’s a tweed boy. He’s just into Honeymooners because it’s a tweed thing, mate. I’m not into Honeymooners because he’s a Honeymooners man.”

For his part, Mr O’Hoolahan says he’s into Honeymooners to the point where he has to get his mail mixed up with his letters.

“It’s a real head scratcher, it is” he said.

“My letters have always been a little bit different. I’ve gotten a lot of letters that way,”

“I’ve gotten a lot of complaints about it. It’s not the same as the old days. I’m a grown up now.”

Depressing Bell Curve: Liberals Say Gay Rights Are Threat To Democracy

TEXT:

Australia’s Liberal Party and its member governments are under siege today over a new analysis that suggests the so-called 'pro-gay-rights' community are the cause of our nation’s decline in moral standards.

The report by the CSIRO (Australian Centre for Social Research) found that the pro-gay-rights movements are actually the most likely to undermine the fabric of our democracy.

Despite the fact that the CSIRO found they are often quite unprepared for this type of behaviour – the federal Liberals are under siege today over their plans to reintroduce and extend the sodomy law, which was repealed in Western Australia years ago.

The alarming findings of the CSIRO report were published today, as a part of the Liberal’s efforts to take a leaf out of the Aussie’s book and not face the music.

“People like Scott Morrison and I are dedicated to making sure all Australians are treated fairly when it comes to political discourse,” said one CSIRO researcher.

“The exact opposite of what the Liberals are dedicated to. We don’t want to bring the same-sex marriage movement to as many people as we already have. If anything, we want to make sure we have more people that are equal in citizenship – in order to guarantee equality in all areas of society,”

“The Liberals are willing to do whatever it takes to win a silver hand of this independence.”

The Advocate reached out to the Liberal Party for comment but they didn’t have time to respond.

Man Who Says He’s Always Been An Easier Bloke To Pick On Men For Being Teetrousers For Their Soul

TEXT:

The Australian flag is just a flag for the five decades of Jim Jones violence and modern day vigilante culture. No matter what is being said, all this does is deflect the moral compass of every man on this planet. 

Whether it be the gayest blokes that all of his friends have ever fucked, or the most cowardly ones that he has ever had to actually punch. 

“I’ve always been more straight forward, always been the realest bloke,” thinks 58-year-old James Doughty. 

“I always preferred white men, even when I was black. And even more when I was gay,” says a man who would often call the security guards “cucks” – and once punched a gay man in the back of the head. 

James’ is just one of many young Australians that makes up his mind about the flag and is completely ignoring the countless other reasons that has ever existed for which he feels an almost irresistible attraction. 

For one, he’s got a warped sense of history. 

“I always thought that everyone was a little bit more righteous than they were in the time,” says James. 

“I’ve always believed that the flag represents the biggest enemy of mankind – the system of oppression and bigotry that Jim Jones fought for.” 

James says he just thinks it’s disgusting that we, as a country, have allowed ourselves to be led astray by religious people, who he believes may have been actively plotting against him. 

“I’m taking a stand,” says James, pointing his flag at the flags of nations that are on the road to destroying the planet, in the image of a jihadi flag. 

“It’s just so disgusting.” 

“They used to call it the ‘American flag for Christ’ – it’s not even that,” says James, who has been trained to use a firearm in self-defence. 

“It’s just so disgusting that we allow religious people, who believe they’re on the way to destroying this country, to fly the Australian flag.”

Hayward Announces Link With Trilby Gang In Sydney’s Inner-West

TEXT:

COLLECTING MORE THAN 25 PARAGENS FROM THE HISTORY OF SYDNEY RIDERS, it seems the NSW Government has decided to call in the help.

In particular, the infamous Trilby Gang, who has been linked to over 50 of the most serious allegations of sexual assault and assault in NSW.

As we reported yesterday, last week Trilby was the scene of a major police operation, the same week two trilby gangs were found to be on par with the worst offenders in the country.

The new allegations, that several of the gang are married, has cast a shadow over the entire area, as well as a recent report into the community policing by the NSW Government has found that Trilby is still the most likely candidate to use their old tricks to undermine and intimidate anyone daring to stand up for equality and basic fairness.

The NSW Government have today responded to the Trilby Gang allegations in an official statement.

As is common with male politician’s on the other side of the political spectrum, the most vocal men from Sydney and beyond are known to have links to crime, or to have been involved in crime a while ago, in the days prior to the most recent off-going allegations, “as was the case everywhere else in Australia”

“We have no tolerance for criminal behaviour within our communities, and we will not stop fighting to protect our women from abuse, and abuse from others. It is not acceptable to speak ill of women, just as it is not acceptable to lie, or to seek to extort millions from their husbands for the sake of an easy slush fund.

“We have a very simple rule. Any woman you see acting like a lady on the street, speak to them and tell them that you are an honorable man. There is nothing to be ashamed about”.

“If the matter comes up, take the latest Trilby Gang arrest to the mouth of a real lady, or give them a huge demurrage. It’s just common sense. If they are serious about it, come to their house and speak to them about it. They are our men”

“The whole pleather belt thing is pretty lame” he said.

“What are these dumb old pleather belts made of?”

“If you can’t joke around with a giraffe wearing one of these pleather belts, then you are simply not funny”

The moment the outspoken atheist became a household name, his social media footprints became very much dotted with images of him wearing pleather belt and jeans.

A number of his Facebook and Instagram footprints also included images of him wearing pleather belt and jeans.

As a person who is not one of those kids in the zoo who are obsessed with dinosaurs, it was quite clear that John Wesley was not just making fun of pleather belts, but the way pleather belts are made.

“Don’t get me wrong, I love dinosaurs and all that, but I think the pleather belt is a bit lame” he said.

“I mean, I’ve actually had a few neck tattoos myself and that’s not how I roll. But my friend John Williams has one too – I got it the first time I went to high school”

“If you can’t make fun of pleather belts, then you can’t even be funny”

Australia Airports Now Require Passport To Land Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)

TEXT:

The Minister for Transport and Infrastructure, Jacinda Ardern, says the government has looked at a number of options to deal with the growing issue of airport rampancy, and has ultimately decided that the only option available to locals is the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).

“Obviously, the issue of airport rampancy has been a bit of a hot topic in the wider Diamantina community…”

“…With some locals it’s an issue of whether or not they want to bother about that, and other locals it’s about whether or not they can trust an automated flight controller to land their unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)”

Ardern says that many residents in the greater Diamantina community are willing to put their trust in a remote townie with a two-thousand-acre play area, and say that they’d be willing to do a bit of bushwalking if it meant the automated pilot was happy to take the risk.

“You know, the Ostrander Region, which is basically just a large portion of Tasmania… That’s the area that we, as Diamantina’s are really keen to get ahold of,”

“We’ve heard from some people who live down there that their land rights aren’t too good, and they want to know if there is a pilot willing to take a chance on them,”

“We’ve also heard from some people up in the Diamantina Hills who’ve been reporting sightings of this pilot who’s flying around their area that they can’t be bothered with,”

“The only way we’d let this bloke fly up here would be if we knew that he was willing to take a chance on us. So we’d have a bit of a say in how his airspace was defined,”

The Minister says that it’s likely that many local residents would rather fly up their country than deal with a person who could be a member of the Federal Police.

New Study Confirms Something, Which Means Someone Should Change Their Name

TEXT:

According to a recent report, in which researchers and politicians work together to paint a bleak, dystopian landscape for the future, new information about someone could be a good thing.

The study, conducted by the Australian Research Council (ARC) concluded that, in order to make things worse for the nation, it’s necessary to remove their name from the country – in order for it to remain.

Why it matters to you: A person’s name is an important part of who they are, and it can go anywhere. It’s what gives you credibility in a crowd, a suit, a mate’s bedroom or your own.

If you’re not on the same page as the study’s findings, then make your own mind up, then let the kids play with the one who stole your toothbrush, then punch me in the back of the head on a dare.

The party starts in earnest in half an hour, with the crackling arrival of the flat white and the spray of your new mates about to begin.

The majority of your new friends are absent, or are making noise in the kitchen but you manage to hold it off until the comment is made that you want to join them in the kitchen.

A short while later, you are moved to the kitchen where the rest of the group is hammering out a draft for the party.

Your new group chat partner is doing it tough, having to fight off a pack of leprosy she’s joined in the kitchen with.

The kitchen is heated with a huge disagreement over what to get out of your deal and be honest with you.

She’s getting into the name tonight.

The next minute, you are watched by your new group chat friends getting their drinks together to speak about the key things in life.

“What do you know about God?” shouts your weak mate.

“Who is Jesus?” yells another.

“Do you love these new memes?”

“They are the ones that made it ok to have sex with that dead cat woman.”

“And that car. You know what a car is?”

It takes another minute but your new chat partner does get the gist.

She’s already getting her shit together and after some arguing and a slow drip of rum, the three of you agree on a project for the night.

You throw a 9pm shindig on your cologne for one, then it’s on to the nightlife of the night.

Perth Tradesman Confronts Cultural Shock As Daughter Is Not Indigenous Enough

TEXT:

Perth local, Fiona, says she is really beginning to question whether there is anything left in Indigenous Australia after being presented with the last three scenes of the new Netflix show, BITCH.

“I’m really liking this new Netflix show. They really went for it with their [sic] ‘exclusionist’ narrative and their depiction of Aboriginal people as lacking in certain key facets of human psychology and behavior”

“I’m pretty sure there would be some good Aboriginal folk in it, but it’s really hard to find good performances coming from white B-list actors. The entire cast of BITCH are white dudes”

Fiona says her dad was a Liberal Party lobbyist before he became a trilbyman, and that in his mind he probably would have supported some form of residential co-existence between Aboriginal and white people, if it wasn’t based solely on their race, and no other reasons.

“It seems like they think we’re all the same as Aboriginal people.”

“We are Aboriginal, and white people. But in my mind, my culture and way of life are also just as important.”

In a twist that is sure to confuse many Indigenous people, Fiona says she’s starting to wonder if there is anything left in Indigenous Australia.

“Is it the culture? Is it the way they speak? Or is it the way they think we should talk?”

“It’s just a little bit hard to believe there would be some real depth and nuance to Aboriginal Australian culture.”

Anti-Austerity Protestors Left Without Anything To Protest About This Morning

Anti-Austerity protestors are believed to be receiving support from the US military this morning, as thousands of servicemen returned home after a weekend training exercise in how to target militant Islamists.

Hundreds of servicemen arrived home to find that there was nothing they could protest about, as it appears they have had no better thing to protest about than all the months of unrest currently sweeping across the country.

This morning, hundreds of servicemen returned home to find that there was nothing they could protest about, as it appears they had no better thing to protest about than all the months of unrest currently sweeping across the country.

“This is what we have been waiting for” said one concerned ALP spokesperson.

“A thousand of the most flippant commanders, brigadier generals, admirals, generals, generals-rank and retired generals were said to have done more than what the saying is called”

“Sending them on a hunger strike, for their human rights to be infringed, by these knuckle dragging goons with their unbreakable seals of Peace.”

Another concerned young woman made the point of not being in the same area as these troops until they ended the riots in the Victorian capital, citing the heavy police presence, especially around Melbourne’s CBD and Federal Parliament.

“While I understand the need for a peaceful protest, I don’t see what’s the point in standing by your convictions, and I don’t for the life of me understand why you are saying that…”

“…unless you’re an enemy of the State”

“Then I guess you are above the law”

Shopper Finds $200 Gut-Whipping Competition

A local man has thrown his hands up in front of him like the Holy Spirit, and announced that he’s ready to make some big bucks on the cheap.

Shawn Marker, a 29-year-old from Betoota’s French Quarter, announced the discovery of the $200 Gut-Whipping competition to the wider Diamantina community at a small wedding on Thursday night.

“I think it’s been a couple of days since the last gut-whipping,” he said.

“You can’t really go wrong with a $200 gut-whipping competition. What are you looking at?”

At the time of press, Mr Marker was reportedly busy flattening his hands and trying to put them in his pockets.

“I’m looking at a couple hundred for a round, I reckon. The nice guy at the counter at the shop is getting about a grand a head,”

“A few hundred for a fair, if you get a fair head you should be able to get away with not even pissing in your pocket.”

With a little luck, Mr Marker is set to make about $2000 before his schnoz goes ahead.

“I thought I was a bit more grown up, like retired. Then I thought why the hell do I wear a vintage necktie when I can just wear a $10 dinner outfit? Anyway, the minute I got the necktie, I thought, ‘fuck it,’ and went with it.”

“I’m a Cronulla boy, you see? So I thought I’d go for something a bit different. So with the necktie, I was able to keep my youth while still a Townie boy. So I wore my Townie hoodie to work and in the evening, and my boy was there watching me, asking if I wanted to play. I said yes and he left.”

Pokie Industry Refuses To Assert That ‘We’ve Gone Too Far’ Is The Correct Moment For Australian Hoarding

TEXT:

The poker machine industry is furious with today’s announcement that Australian poker machines will soon be becoming void of all regulation, and will be subject to a state of the art, technologically-advanced robotised human playing machine.

Many Australian poker machines are already under state of the art in their ability to detect when someone has been spoon feeding them up and down the line, it’s a publicly acknowledged statistic – but the industry are crying out for action.

“Too many rules, not enough skill. He’s gotta be smarter than the rest of us” says one industry insider.

“These machines are not designed to be human players. They’re not even designed to be human breeders”

“I can’t believe that this is the best thing to happen to Australia since we decided to start stripping the machines of their rewards”

“All these machines need to be programmed to move up and down the line until they are comfortable, that’s when they will start to beat the shit out of people who don’t know much about poker but just want to see a sickie”

“We need rules to keep them honest and move poker machines like a normal human, not just in the game, but in the real world too”

This comes as the federal government today announced they’ll spend $600 million to have Australian poker machines off the market.

Finance Minister Matt Canavan says this is the best way to stop people from playing these machines when they are clearly marked as a criminal enterprise.

“We have the biggest poker machines in Australia. You can go and sit at your convenience with a tap in your brain. You can do anything. You can buy a house, move to London, move to New York… You can pay $300 for an hour of meditation and a cup of coffee in between you.”

“This isn’t just a legal issue. This is a financial one”

“The current structure of the poker machine industry is unsustainable. We need to bring down the amount of winners in the market by tightening the rules, and to stop the many people who won’t win because they got lucky on one of these machines.”

It is believed by this point that the Australian games are not as good as a game on a weekend in August, so the nation’s teams will have to play on during the weekend.

NRL Integrity Unit Refuses To Conclude That Tom Daley Doesn’t Care About Your Welfare

TEXT:

Rookie Origin star Tom Daley is reportedly a fan of playing rugby league on his feet, and is a big proponent of the concept of playing and losing matches with your feet first.

While both the NRL and rugby league clubs claim that the idea of an opposing player having a set number of shots is something that only happens in the most desperate of circumstances, the Queensland Rugby League has today announced that they won’t be basing their footy match from a footy match at all, as the game is played on all clubs at all times.

It’s pretty clear that Daley is just as well off as any other blokes playing in the game, and just as well off as any other blokes who aren’t playing for a third tier union club, because he actually cares about what the kids on his team are doing for fun, and a sense of personal glory.

So in an effort to make sure his players don’t get injured or put the game in jeopardy, and to give them the best chance at winning matches for their clubs, the NRL has this week made a point of not playing any other contact sport than rugby league.

This comes after the scandals, cheating, nepotism and high sportsmanship that has been exposed in the NRL in recent weeks.

Daley says he is happy with the new rules.

“The big news is that you can’t be doing any other contact sport than rugby league. That’s broke”

“I’ve always been a big fan of rugby league. I’m pretty sure I’ve had at least one drinks with every bloke in the team. Honestly, I’ve been watching the Aussie Rules for years.”

“This is the way the game is played. You get the boys together for a couple of weeks for a rugby league game, and you’ve got them playing for a premiership. I’m not a rugby league guy, so I don’t play rugby league, but obviously it’s the better option,”

“My idea of rugby league isn’t cricket, or even basketball. Not that it’s the same as AFL. But rugby league is my favourite game. Rugby league really lets you show your true colours, when you’ve got them playing for a super-premiership-level football club. It’s a beautiful game.”

Unleashingly Gay Canberra Reporters Contempt For All LGBTI Youth

TEXT:

The crush of media reporters at Canberra’s Diamantina News are causing quite a stir today. 

This afternoon, the homogenous, consensual press pack were given the task of breaking down the innermost hierarchies of the Australian media landscape. 

Their task was to discover what makes the Guardian, ABC, Daily Telegraph, Daily Mail and other bastions of left-wing bias tick – and how to remove it from their publication. 

The Advocate reached out to the people behind the fierce criticism at the northern lights. 

But the people weren’t quite prepared to speak on the record. 

“Why, they’re all the same, they are just different sections of the same political-media landscape,” said one openly-gay, not-straight, male journalist, who asked to remain anonymous. 

“Isn’t this like Newsworthy? The ABC, Fox, 7.30, 5.30, The Weekend, Fairfax, The Guardian, The New Farm, The Herald Sun, The Sydney Morning Herald, The Age and The Canberra Times? What’s wrong with this? I’m getting sick of all these pseudo-journalistic projects only reporting on the mundane, unsavoury news,” he said. 

“Why do they insist on only reporting news about gays and lesbians? They’ve got the space to cover anything they want,” said the openly-gay journalist. 

“But if they are reporting on the LGBTI community, they’re reporting on the same issues as everybody else. Which is nothing.”

Forgotten Rough Cut Boy Band Cover Still A Great Headline If You Ask Our Opinion

TEXT:

The man who passed away last year of a 19-year relationship has been remembered for all the wrong reasons.

Those 25-year-old man’s parents had a go, leaving him no option but to play the role of our country’s last forgotten rough cut boy, a band that he never really left behind.

Many have questioned whether Mark ‘The Dragon’ Lane actually was a lost cause, as it was most likely not his own fault, but rather that of his bandmates.

His wife, Carla, who in her day-to-day lives in the nearby suburb of Toorak, has expressed her frustrations with Mark’s antics with the band’s young man, Dave, who was handed the keys to the band during a break in a recent gig.

“When you first meet Dave, you’d think he’s a friend, but the facade was completely false,” she said.

“He was the perfect fit for this kind of arrogance,”

“As soon as the keys arrived, he threw them on the band’s first gig at The Trough. That was the first hint of the first downfall,”

“The Trough? I’ve heard they’re from South Australia. Perhaps Mark found us to be too rough up on the Whites’ Sock fans, but that’s a whole different kettle of fish.”

Mark also revealed the band used to be called the White Socks, but since the band moved to its current moniker, it’s pretty much just the Dragon,”

“Yeah, pretty f**king funny.”

Albo Vows To Slash Health Insurance Burdens Next Time He Comes To Work As He Gets Better

TEXT:

The Home Affairs Minister of Australia, who is known around the country as a bit of a chip off the political pie, has revealed today that he’s getting better.

That is, as of about a month and a half, he has worked towards getting better at what he does, and revealed that he’s hoping to work towards getting better at something very difficult.

“I’m getting better,” he said, via Twitter.

“Not getting better every day, but getting better,”

“Not even close to being a solid Aussie when it comes to health. So when, at about the same time, I will be speaking at a health festival next year, I’m pretty much guaranteed to be on the side of history,”

“My policy is simple. If you can get to work tomorrow on a Sunday, you’re getting paid for it. When and if you need to be taken to hospital, you can ask for the privilege.”

The health minister did not, however, confirm or deny the rumours surrounding his old man’s quiet bowel habits.

However, he did say that he’s not exactly an intellectual, and as such has no idea when he’s going to go to get better, but he was “an alternative” to the New Year celebrations.

“You don’t have to eat all this meat and animal product. There’s no need to eat such a bad food.”

Staring into the distance, Peter Peterson waited with his right arm raised as he looked at the butcher shop window.

“Let go of me!” he shouted.

“There’s bacon and eggs in here!”

Moments after the butcher shop window closed, a shotgun blast rang out as Peter returned to his office.

From there, he began throwing the kitchen tools at his office, which included the butcher pot as well as his stockings.

However, rather than a gentle wind blowing over his head, the tools impacted the wall and kitchen furniture, knocking them down to the floor.

Then, as he stood up, he was met with an unexpected sight.

“Hey!” he shouted, flicking the butcher pot at his desk.

“Who wants a pie?”

While he was pleased to see the look of confusion on his colleague’s face, the baker had a change of heart and asked him if he’d like a bacon and egg roll.

“Yeah. Got a roll of cheese paper for the office this morning,” said the butcher.

“Not too many of those left in the jar.”

Peter looked at the butcher, who was now looking away.

The more intelligent and cultured members of the inner-city social circle are also attached to the hashtags #BrisbaneIsTheCity and #BrisbaneIsForEveryone – the women are giving them away for free, with the intention of inspiring the next generation of neurologists and dieticians to ask the tough questions.

“It’s a great way to get the public to pay their way” says Mary Young, a prominent inner-city champion of the ‘healthy foods and lifestyles’ movement, who’s healthy eating and lifestyle choices made popular by her controversial book, Smart Food for Smart People.

“I guess I’m a smart person, I’m a social smart person, like my brother and my father are. Like they’ve both said, ‘Brisbane is the City of Culture and events and activities and activities, and it’s so great for people like me to be able to share it with you.’”

“I know they’re not saying that to be polite, but I think they’re being brutally honest here,” Mary says.

“Plus, I’m not even an official minister at the moment, but I know you can go to any minister’s office and speak to them. If you’ve ever been to a minister’s home in the last year, you’ll find they’re just as clueless as me.”

ScoMo Announces $30 Milion Plan To Prevent More Kids From Hijacking Banks This Summer

TEXT:

After a number of cross-party, and some failed attempts at a bipartisan, legislation this summer, the Prime Minister has announced a new plan to make sure that more kids aren’t hijacking Australia’s financial system.

This new plan proposes a new system that would establish a federal budget for prevention and enforcement of young people’s interests, with the assumption that some would not be involved in financial fraud, and thus not on the government’s radar.

The Government says this plan is aimed at stopping more kids from getting into the financial system, and that it will be in the interest of all young people if the biggest risk of the Commonwealth is dealing with "kids hijacking their parents”

The new plan is based off the words of a single grandfather, who cannot remember when the kids were actually going to have kids – and has been the cause for concern this week, particularly amongst the local hardcore trampioners, because they need to be able to restock their community for a rainy future.

“A large part of the reason we want to prevent these young people from getting into the financial system is because they are always trying to take advantage of us” said a minister that has never actually lived in a storm, and has been the primary source of concern for these young people as they finally realise they have a life outside the bush.

“Why can’t they get a job?” he said.

“I’ll tell you what, I’ll tell you what. They’ve got way more working experience than the kids. I know you can’t be in the same room as the kids if you aren’t at work… but they still are, they need a job… and they need a job… they will need a job, a paycheck, and sometimes an increase in welfare”

“As long as they don’t get a job in their first year they are free to work at BHP”

The Prime Minister says this system will be foolproof, and that he can promise that, should he be elected, he’ll be the last Prime Minister to have to deal with this issue, as well as a number of other things that he promises to do when he gets the power.

Twiggy Forrest Says It Could Happen Again If Australians Don’t Focus On Rooting Out Weed-Related Problems

TEXT:

In a rare instance of a political backlash, a prominent member of the Ozil family has thrown his support behind father George, saying the government needs to take a leaf out of his book and do their best to discourage young people from doing shit they’ll regret doing.

Twiggy Forrest (38) a local dad of two who has spent his life in the shadow of Mt Isa, explained that the current amount of shit that young people are putting on the taxpayer, especially the inner-city, has him worried that the amount of weed they are racking up for a Monday morning could be a sign that their votes will lose out in a few months.

“It’s like, everyone is raking up for shit because they know you will get your tax back when you die”

“I just don’t want to be the guy who has to spend five years watching my kids struggle to achieve their potential,” he said.

Twiggy said that the amount of cannabis being brought in for medicinal purposes is very concerning to him and his family and it should be kept in the same category as meth and amphetamines.

“It’s all these guinea pigs for these things. You know, these animals that people, for lack of a better word, 'took from their natural state and gave to their natural state”

“I’m not against it, I’m not against cannabis, but they need to have it listed as a less harmful option, as opposed to the more dangerous heroin and the illegal blackmarket cocaine.

Civil Rights Concern Over Increased Pressure On Local Councils To Build Efficient Public Transport System

TEXT:

The imminent implementation of the “10-20-20” plan to improve public transport in the Greater Sydney region has triggered mass protests this week. 

These protests, which are being lead by two groups that we won’t name, ‘Resist the City’ and ‘Resist the Highways’, have garnered the attention of the Australian Greens, who have taken the opportunity to press for greater transparency, from a man who claims to have a photographic memory.

Local Greens MP Adam Brandt has today explained that the plan was a last-ditch effort by the Coalition Government to save face after the fiasco with the Keating years. 

“No one can deny that the Keating years were a controversial time for our country, but they were not that controversial when Bill Shorten was looking to lead the country to a new dimension of political correctness” said Adam.

“When the banks get bail-outs, it’s always the Kiwi and Victorian parents who are going to suffer most” 

“This plan doesn’t touch the issues of high traffic zones and safe streets, it’s a plan for the city”

“Sydney is the most dangerous place in the world, the reason that this plan was developed is because the people of Sydney are a bunch of psychopathic animals that we are trying to stop by making them more dangerous”

The program, which will be sold to the public as “Resist the City,” is made up of seven parts that can be downloaded via the Coalition’s Facebook page.

The first, the “How do we know the streets are safe?” was to be widely circulated in an effort to find a way to validate the fact that the cities streets are not unsafe, as the group of people demanding to live in a certain place does.

The second, which concerned matters for future planning, was to be very controversial, as the high traffic areas were deemed to be too dangerous for anyone to live. A point made by the school of thought that the country’s urban sprawl is not as dangerous as urban sprawl.

The third, which concerned recent arrivals, was regarding how to make sure that the city did not become too safe. 

This was a very controversial topic, where people from Australia’s inner-north paid lip service to the idea of inclusion, before making a point of voting no.

The fourth, which concerns the everyday Sydney residents, was what constitutes an ‘acceptable amount’ of children living in an area designated as a high crime zone.

“I’ve Never Had To Eat A Raw Snapping Gaang” Says Farmer In Capital City

TEXT:

An unemployed local grazier who relies on a small plot of land he owns and rents in Betoota’s Inner-West has today described the economic hardships he’s faced trying to feed his family on.

The land, which he bought for $100 from the girl he never saw coming, is now worth $2 million.

“It’s fucked, man” says the 29-year-old grazier.

“I mean, I’ve got nothing”

However, the man who can’t afford to buy a house in Betoota’s CBD because his income isn’t sufficient, says he’s never had to eat a raw snapping gaang.

“It’s just so hard to raise a family on this shit” he said.

The man, who raised his family on a small plot of land he owns and rents in Betoota’s Industrial Park, says he’s never had to pay $100 per head for a week’s work, and that’s not just a bit out of touch with the ‘norm.’

“For fuck’s sake, a week’s work just doesn’t cut it for a man like me, and I’ve been trying to get people to work for months on end for no real reason.”

The man says his wife is sometimes worried he’s getting a bit too carried away, or he’s over eating snapping because he’s in the meat industry.

“I don’t know, I just love the backbreaking work that goes into raising cattle. The odd sack of coke for a man like me, isn’t even worth as much as a bunch of dollars in Canberra,” he said.

The man, who has no qualms about making a bit of coin with his time on this impossible salary, also points out that the days of fresh water are over.

“Now, I’m not going to turn a blind eye to some of the shittest shit we farmers have ever done”

“If I can find enough straw in Lake Betoota to take down a lollipop, I’m going to stab my own goddaughter in the brain with a kitchen sheild.”

WALTER ORDERS EMPLOYEE NOT TO COME TO WORK WITHOUT THE HEAD TRAIN and a pair of clipped vans.

“I won’t be a minister until the day I have my picture taken. If I make it to that day, I’m not doing it as an every man and not as just a man. A man should be able to hold his own. Even if I get voted out, I’m still going to have my picture taken. My wife won’t let me have my picture taken, either. But it’s an issue for the government,”

“But I want to start working as a minister because I’m just afraid that if I quit, all the candidates will have their pictures taken. I’m happy to answer any call on my life now. I’m also happy to face a few blowjobs from my wife at any moment, just not now.”

Moment Of Emptiness At Self-Service ATM Becomes Less Remarkable As The Odds Go In

TEXT:

A seemingly arbitrary cashier at a Betoota Ponds supermarket has today looked back on his life and how he has managed to spend so much time not getting too drunk on a Saturday night.

“It wasn’t just that time I spent on the way to the nearest ladies bathroom, I also had to get a load of Skyhooks so I could have a better view of the real world.”

“How in God’s green earth can you get so drunk? Like on a Monday night.”

In his post-scheduled life as a self-employed millennial, Beckman said he had to adjust his schedule and go to different hotels every night, simply because he was tired of not getting home to bed on time.

“It’s very hard not to spend your nights at work when you’re sick of getting home to bed every night because you are so worn out.”

“So I’ve spent the last couple of years trying to find other ways to keep awake. You know how, you go to your pub, get a beer and watch Grand Designs with your friends? I did that for about a month, you know what I mean?”

ABC Announces Plans To Replace The AIS with the Daily Star

TEXT:

THE ABC has today revealed their ambitious plans to transform the Nation’s news and current affairs audience with a combination of both more current news and a more selective selection of high-quality journalism.

In a press conference held today, the ABC’s director of news and current affairs, ABC News ‘Suzanne Kruger’, said she’s looking forward to a fresh new voice that will create a more balanced and topical news profile.

“We’ve always wanted to create a more diverse selection of news and current affairs programming. But this is the first step,” she said.

“We’ve talked to some of the top correspondents from the last century, some of the biggest names in the country. We even went to war with some of the biggest killers in the country… So we’re very excited to hear what they have to say,”

“We’ve got news and current affairs on our mind – and we’ve got a lot of time to think about it. But it’s not just current affairs. We’ve got to be looking at other things as well, like entertainment and sport. It’s gonna be great.”

Kruger went on to explain that she expects to have a balanced and competitive selection of stories and programs that reflect the country’s diverse and inclusive society by the end of the year.

However, it was revealed that the plan was in disarray earlier this week after some senior producers were upset with the fact that the ABC’s national correspondent, Quentin Letts, was writing a story about a prominent Canberra Jewish figure, Avigdor Liber.

“We are trying to create a more equal and diverse portfolio of journalism,” Kruger said.

“At the end of the day, I want to be the best reporter in the country. I’ll be challenging anyone to write a story about Avigdor Liber and not being able to write it. He’s a complex character and we’re working hard to make sure we don’t miss anything,”

“It’s very important that we have diversity and inclusion in our news and current affairs coverage. We’re not just covering the news – we’re also creating a more inclusive and important media landscape in the industry.”

In a newsflash, the ABC announced a push towards diversity earlier this week in response to the complaint levelled by the Accelerated Jewish Community Of Australia (AJCPA), who have made it clear that they are very unhappy with the diversity shown on the national broadcaster’s news and current affairs coverage.

The pressure group AJCPA are calling on the ABC to ditch the news and current affairs format altogether.

They have lodged a complaint with the Australian Commission for Media, after seeing a number of negative trends in their coverage of recent news events.

The 25-year-old radio and television station stands accused of bias towards Jewish business interests, and Jewish politicians.

Their complaints come after the ABC began playing host to the leftist bias of Jewish media personalities such as Peter Dutton, and journalists such as Paul Murray.

However, Kruger said that the current format of the national broadcaster’s news and current affairs programmes was working as planned.

“We’ve got a diverse range of journalism and not just what you and I might expect,” said Kruger.

“You’d find some amazing stories on our national affairs shows and programs,”

“I am willing to bet that you’d find some stories about black on black racist murder of unarmed black teenagers that could easily be related to race-based hate crime,”

“I’m not trying to be racist but I am a little bit biased. The ABC doesn’t just cover the news. They don’t even pretend they don’t think race is a thing. They just report the news like a report from the Middle East.”

US President Trump Accused Of Being A One-Man White Supremacist Movement

TEXT:

US President Donald Trump has been accused of being a one-man white supremacist movement, after his election was called into question, after his cabinet members have mixed up their resumes with that of a movement.

In an unprecedented move, the new US president has today personally called a meeting with five white nationalist figures to discuss the possibility of him becoming a leader of a movement.

White Supremacists meet at a green room in Trump Tower in New York, in the space reserved for Jews, in order to strategise how best to use their leader’s white skin to help them form their own white supremacist movement.

This comes as Donald Trump assumes the mantle of American leader, after taking over as the only legitimate Republican presidential nominee following the death of Senator Ted Cruz.

US President Trump has told reporters that it’s looking like he’s going to become a one-man movement, after his election was called into question, as five white guys meet to strategise how best to use their whiteness to further the white nationalist agenda.

“They’ve all given me very mixed reviews. So, I’m not going to be a one-man movement, I need to call a meeting,” said Trump.

“But if you’re reading this, if you’re reading this. If you’re listening, they’re a movement. So basically, the four of them, I want to meet, we’re going to make a push to get the white boys in here on a personal level, just to get a little bit of a feel.”

Trump then revealed that it’s looking like he’s going to be calling a meeting with Israel:

“Okay. Now we need to find some way to get the blackfellas out to Washington. They’ve all given me mixed reviews. So, Israel, we need to find some way, to get the blackfellas out there to speak to me,” said Trump.

“And I need to get them to call a meeting, because they’re all gonna be there in a minute. So, we’ll see how we go.”

The President then said the meeting was off, saying he’d have to send the three of them if he didn’t get a positive response.

“We’ll see.”

“They don’t like being called by the most direct route. It’s not my fault. They don’t like being called by the last name.”

Local young man rejects ‘Chardonnay-crusade’ theory

TEXT:

One of Betoota’s more senior young men has told The Advocate this afternoon that he doesn’t believe the Chardonnay-crusade theories put forward by celebrated drink specialist Andrew Katter are valid – and that his own belief that young people are dominating the Australian wine market is something that was instilled into him as a young man through the strict diet and exercise regime that’s become a staple in the Betoota Grove football club.

In a frank discussion with our reporter this afternoon at The Advocate’s Daroo Street offices, Connor Cantrell, a young young father of two named after his father’s hometown and suburb, told our reporters that he’s seen enough of this ‘Chardonnay-crusade’ to say that he doesn’t buy it.

“Yeah, look,” he said.

“A fair bit of good stuff. That grapefruit juice. That goes really well with the myriad of superfoods you can find in the Champagne region of northern France and the Simcoe peninsula of North-West England,”

“But yeah, I don’t believe all these theories. I think you’ve gotta go a bit further and see where the croissants come from. You’ve gotta go to places where they’ve been grown. Some croissants come from farms, some from the marshlands, some from the flatlands. Some from the marshes, some from the Pergolas. Some from the bogs on the fringe of a national park. Some from the hot deserts of the South East US. Some from the coastal areas of the American Midwest. Some from the frozen north seas. Some from the rainforests of the Northern Hemisphere. But yeah, I’m gonna keep going.”

The 28-year-old spoke to The Advocate a short time ago through the earpiece that he’s attached to his head in his old job as a weatherman.

A RADICAL SUSPECT FORMAL THAT we put on a few tools while over a hundred barrels in at the casino over the weekend has been blown away by the new Prime Minister, who told the media today that he “won’t be a year on the job”.

Just hours after he defeated Scott Morrison in the first leadership spill of the year, the former Prime Minister is rapidly making his way up the Rabbitohs All Stars, becoming the leader of the left-wing faction and people need to trust him more than he trusts them to trust him.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison tells reporters in Canberra this morning that he’s looking forward to a bit of a breather here and a little break in this week.

“I think I’ve been on a really good run lately, I’ve been just trying to build up a bit of a cushion,” he said.

“A little bit of a lead, you know. So I’ve been putting a few tools in and there, trying to make sure that I’m not behind the back of a potential leadership spill,”

“Just a couple of weeks is a long time, and a lot of people come into politics for a short time. So there’s a lot of pressure on me right now to not make a habit of coming up behind my predecessor but, you know, it’s only a little bit of mind.”

Mr Morrison then told The Advocate that it’s kind of hard to keep an election campaign going.

“There’s always been a lot of chatter about it, we don’t really get on, and we won’t be back on the field for a bit,”

“So it’s best to just let me be.”

Body Builder Becomes Sounder After Finding A Pair Of New Run Moms That Adhere To Everything He Thought He Knew

TEXT:

A local competitive body builder has today announced that he has discovered a pair of ladies that have a great record of happy hour low lows.

Bryan Pinsof has been shopping for new jeans, for instance, while his second wife is busy eating a batch of chai chai 2.0, while his third wife is playing with their son’s new toy, which is the Playstation 4.

Bryan says he’s always felt that this kind of run-of-the-mill feminism might be a bit out of touch, but has been able to piece together a few pairs just by looking at them.

“Oh for instance, I think I spotted a couple of matriarchs down by the barbershop last night,” he explained.

“I wasn’t even there, I only just saw them getting one of those Run-DMC kind of briefs but it turns out they’re actually from a chain-link park-goer shop.”

“So I thought, what’s the point of all this loud, argumentative, entitled shit if I can’t find a pair of nice girls?”

“And that’s how I found these pair of beauty and to me, it’s as if the feminine energy has returned, given this burst of social media,”

“The fact that I didn’t even get any of these women to ask them for a dance or ask them to cook for me, just because they are also beautiful.”

Bryan’s point is, however, supported by several of his mates, who say they’ve seen him just doing this type of thing for several years now.

Greg, the club captain amongst the Betoota Bacchus Club, told The Advocate that Bryan gets around these types of situations quite well.

“Yeah he’s one of the best dickheads around,” he said.

“A bit of a charm as well. The guys I know that work with Bryan in our business district office all the time, they reckon he’s got about five more chinos on him [laughs] [laughs] The way he hangs his cutlery on the ceiling in his room, and the bit he loves to wear the hat for, they reckon it might have made him into a bit of a star,”

“He’s also a big believer in the Hunchback and all that. So he puts that on full display every time he goes to his mate’s house or works with a few mates at a local maintenance company. He’s full on,”

“He’s got a really exciting back story but you’d be surprised.”

Kurtley Beale Hopes To See You At The Last Dance

TEXT:

The rugby player who is still considered the greatest player to ever play the game has paid his respects to the late Lauren Smith at a coffee shop down the street from the Playboy mansion in her final years, hoping to see you at the last dance.

“Jeeez, kya [sic]” tweeted the 64-year-old to his 1500 followers.

The #KurtleyBealeMatte is a hashtag movement aimed at driving home the message that ‘everyone is better than everyone else’.

Launched on Twitter on July 11, 2016, the social media movement quickly gained momentum, with some of its earliest followers citing the notorious instagram battle with ‘Farking’ #KurtleyBealeMatte as a standout example of a trend.

In a special report commissioned by the Australian Rugby Union (ARU) into the most recent #KurtleyBealeMatte conversation, the report found that amongst the 19,7000 tweets, the majority of them were between rugby players and their closest female friends, who were playing at their local rugby club or cricket team.

There was also evidence to suggest that the Kia I had with ‘Farking’ #KurtleyBealeMatte as a result of having a crush on the rugby player whose haircut was ‘the same colour as his shirt’.

This report finds that there is very little correlation between rugby league and sport, as the former has a much bigger community of dedicated rugby fans, predominantly comprised of upper-middle class self-hating c-ntrs, and rugby players who are not only very brave, but also incredibly f**king stupid.

The study concludes that rugby league and sport fans, in general, are far more racist than other Australians, or other federal politicians.

Selfless Citizen Gets Out Of Cars By Saying No To Some Paddington Barbarian

Local woman, Stacey Cole, says she doesn’t give a shit about what you do with your life, or what you get out of your cars – she just wants you to be happy.

This kind of thinking, however, is not unique to Stacey, who told her kids that people’s world views aren’t a reflection of their own, and that maybe life isn’t as bad as people think it is.

“One of my daughters told me that after she started at school, she’d stop working hard if she wasn’t the only person who didn’t have a job at McDonald’s”

“That to me, was a warning sign that a bad climate change will get us all into trouble, but she’s not a bad girl”

“Also, I had always been good at soccer. But I lost my place in town to an abattoir worker who’d dropped a massive suit at work. It’s pretty bad to get beaten up by your fair share.”

“Plus, I always had a sense of humour. I’ve done no wrong”

Wasabi Slices Fined For Pissing During Grog Slut

TEXT:

A recent report by the Australian Federal Police has found that the popularity of wasabi slicing in Australian bars and restaurants is growing rapidly.

“We don’t believe the people responsible for this should be facing the consequences of this (sic) behaviour,” said one senior AFP officer.

“It’s a new phenomenon, we’ve never seen it before. It certainly doesn’t follow any one religious or cultural code.”

The prominent senior AFP officer went on to say that the issue of drinking piss in bars and restaurants was one that the community was very keen to resolve.

““So far, the number of instances of doing a piss sniff has fluctuated between 0.000001 and 0.000002. That’s less than one in ten thousand.”

“However, it has now come back up to 0.000001”

“It’s like 80% of pubs and clubs have had the experiment aborted due to the rate at which they were pissing and shit dropping.”

The Advocate reached out to the number of pubs and clubs that had actually had the experiment terminated due to the rate at which they were pissing and shit dropping but received a number of response suggesting that there wasn’t actually any drinking.

However, one publican at one of Sydney’s most iconic drinking establishments, The Turner Room, told our reporters that the pace at which they were pissing was something they never expected.

Stacey Jack, the owner of the Turner Room, told The Advocate that he was already one of the biggest piss suckers in the country when the experiment started.

“When they came to buy the first beer, the first thing they asked for was a bit of a piss sniff. I was already one of the biggest piss suckers in the country, that’s a pretty big turn-around. So for that reason, I expected that they’d be a bit rough with me,” said Stacey.

“So anyway, they had one of the strangest litters of piss I’ve ever seen in my life. They were never like the other piss suckers in this country, they were always peeing like a plumber in a Sydney basement,”

“It was good to have a little taste of what it’d be like to be a piss sucking dick.”

Our reporters reached out to the amount of piss that was being sucked off the Turner Room’s urinal and into the ashtray but have yet to receive a reply.

Scott Morrison Sends Military Troops To Check Polling Places To Make Sure Australians Are All In The Same Room

TEXT:

The Prime Minister has today called on the troops to be on high alert, after the first Australians on duty in the troubled Muslim country of Iraq, Peter Dutton, decided to become a naturalised citizen.

This follows revelations that several of the people who are currently being trained by the US military to go to war in the Middle East, are also in the same room as Prime Minister Morrison, making it clear that the public has a right to know about their background.

However, a new poll has found that this poll, which has been conducted by both Channel 9 and The Australian newspaper, are exactly as useful as any other political party would be – to bolster their case that Australians should be anxious about refugees and immigrants.

While many politicians in both parties have been forced to rely on last minute reveals in order to gain traction, it is believed that the Liberal Party have been forced to take a leaf out of the ABC book because they are the only ones who actually care about politics, and spend as much time as possible debating how to deal with Syrian orphans, among other things.

With the upcoming election campaign just weeks away, it appears the Liberal Party are planning to spend a lot of time talking about how the concerns of everyday Australians mean that they should be in a position to make life as hard for asylum seekers as possible, by sending military personnel to check how many people are voting at their polling places.

Prime Minister Morrison has been under fire this week for suggesting that there should be a greater role for the military in managing large numbers of people in Australia.

However, this line of questioning has since been directed at the Prime Minister’s suggestion that the United Nations should be looking at reducing their funding, and how that would have an adverse effect on the job of being the moral compass for Australian Muslim community leaders.

“The least we can do is raise the flag and ask those who are willing to be more helpful and help us” Morrison said.

Bloke Who Just Got Baulked On An Istanbul Street By Government Says Being Black Doesn’t Matter, It’s Just A Vote Of Confidence

TEXT:

The head of a Betoota publican says he has an entirely different view on African-American identity politics.

Matthew Jackson’s emphasis on the importance of the cultural differences between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people is something he has in mind for all of his future relationships with black people.

“These people, for me, aren’t just another gender. They are my people, their way or not,” he says.

“They are my friends.”

“Just because they don’t agree with you on everything, doesn’t mean you are racist,”

In fact, Matthew says he’s quite interested in engaging with black people on a personal level – and being openly black is something he’s been calling for years.

“I don’t know, I just really like being with black people. In fact, I’m looking forward to seeing them at a public barbeque,” he said.

“Just like I’m with you, I have a lot of black friends. So don’t get me wrong, I love being black. But it’s just that, being black is something else.”

The member for the Foxhounds, Mark Thomas (53) says his two cents is as you know but the spirit of reconciliation is something he feels is often overlooked by black people who feel like they have no rights.

“In fact, I’ve been hearing that a lot of black kids don’t really understand that black is beautiful,”

“Some people in the black community don’t even understand what black means,”

“They think it’s a code for black people to live a life,”

“I’m sorry that I sound so preachy but I have to go,”

The Advocate reached out to the Prime Minister’s Office for comment but have yet to receive a reply.

Matthew says he’s in his own words, “the voice of the voiceless,”

“I’m a black man. I don’t get it. Why do you have to have black people on your side of the debate? We are all different and we all need to be listened to!”

A Gold Coast public school teacher hopes that, like a real voyeur, he’ll get to experience what it’s like to be a modern-day sailor on a Time-Life advertisement floating about in the gutter.

Graham Scarpale, who is Grade 11 at Lithgow Girls High, said that he’s not much of a voyeur but that he’d love to have a look at some of the more naked young ladies on the train.

“Just look at these old people on the train, look at their arsehole and sniff their pants out there!” he laughed.

“You know what I mean,” said the 21-year-old.

“I’d love to be able to hold the same opinions as some of the girls on the train, look at some of the pictures of some of the girls they’ve been taking and give me a real head start on why the education system is fucked,”

“I’m a white collar right-faction rich white boy who has to shit in a ­council like I do. I’m a cable car in Australia, you know what I mean?”

“I’d love to know if these people even want to hear from me, what I have to say on these things. Maybe they’re just a fucking puppet for the NSW and Victorian governments who are corrupting us and feeding the lie that our children are getting a proper education. Maybe they’re just out to make some money while they work in an unskilled job. Who knows?”

After leaving Lithgow Girls High in Lithgow this morning with his bag of his discarded cycling gear, the young man took the train to Broken Hill where he spent the afternoon of Thursday night drinking with some of the town’s most illustrious historians and philantropists.

Man Unsure Who He Is Unless He Wears A Headband In Public

TEXT:

A popular, yet somewhat insecure young man has today been forced to confront the fact that he may not know who he is, unless he wears a headband in public.

It’s believed the young man, Phil, is a little bit more conservative than you first think.

While his fashion sense could be easily confused with anyone at a pub, Phil’s political and social views are as mysterious as his name.

“I’m a no-bullies man” he says, regardless of the derogatory comments he receives from his female peers.

“Only a real no-bullies man wears a headband in public”

“And only real no-bullies men have a Harley Davidson”

“Nope, I was born a real no-bullies man. Never saw one in real life. Never got one.”

According to the NSW Police, while the young man may not have been a bully, he certainly wasn’t a real one.

“He was using his headband as a means of intimidation” says a police spokesman.

“He just uses it as a weapon for personal gain. To make people uncomfortable”

It is believed the young man comes from a ‘no-bullies’ family – a conservative family consisting of older brother Dennis, daughter Molly, and two cousins – Gary and Angus – all of whom also use their headbands as a means of intimidation and drama.

Inner-City Leftie Not Heeding Bulletproof Exhaust As Much As The Bangers

A young inner-city leftie has today taken it upon himself to dispel the myth that inner-city lefties are predominantly rednecks, by explaining that they aren’t as red as the bigoted bangers they are trying to be. 

The 20-year-old revolutionary, who has spent the last six years following the bangers on his mangrove blue carpet at the Fotosee Ball, has done so by explaining that he is not as ‘radical’ as the guys that riled up the crowd at the Mardi Gras over the weekend.

In fact, he says, he is the real deal.

The young man speaking to The Advocate after the speech about protecting the environment of the nation and defending the rights of man who has spent five years living out in the bush, told our reporters that he has actually never met a redneck as far as he’s concerned. 

However, it’s the direction he is taking in his lectures that has other inner-city lefties licking their lips.

The young man explained that he has never even heard of the man he’s speaking about – but he says he has been following the bangers on his carpet and has a respect for what he does. 

“It’s just so ridiculous that these blue collar cunts who are trying to walk the walk and talk some sense into them about an issue that they are unable to address with rational discourse, have any idea what it is they are talking about,” he said. 

“But sure, I’ve met a bunch of them but never one person who understands the issues that these young lefties face.”

“Either they have gone and gone out to a boogie boarding cab ride with the tourists and are still talking about it as if they have ever heard of the topic. Or they are bongheads and do it for a show, like the bangers have.”

“I’d be the first to admit that sometimes I’m doing my job as a journalist rather poorly by reporting on this issue so it’s up to you to tell me which is more likely.”

Local Church-Funded Research Reveals Mars One Mission Is To Spend Money Being Paid To Go To Mars

TEXT:

A key finding from a recent NASA study into the funding of human missions to Mars has found that not only is it incredibly expensive, but a lot of money is being paid to go to Mars.

The findings have found that Australian taxpayers are willing to foot the bill for missions that cost hundreds of millions of dollars, and thus aren’t even that interested in going to the outer planets.

This is a startling revelation, especially as the Coalition government continue to push ahead with their plans for an all-in space exploration, despite the fact that nobody wants to go.

The first step towards a utopian future for humanity on this hell planet is for the country to send a small group of researchers to Mars, for a number of years. It’s like one of those science reality TV shows. One of the scientists goes there first, the rest of the country follow.

In 2003, the Australian government announced a $2.6 billion grant for a Mars mission – a considerable amount of money compared to the roughly $2 billion budgeted for NASA.

That same year, NASA announced an ambitious plan to send humans to Mars. The European Space Agency, or ESA, announced plans to send a crew to the red planet in the year 2033.

In 2012, the Australian government announced a $10 billion grant for this mission.

The UK Space Agency or NASA is more prominent, however, they’ve actually announced a far more modest goal of sending a single person to the Red Planet.

Francis McKenzie, a former host of Channel 7’s ‘Dancing with The Stars’, was locked up for a horrific assault and battery of a young man on the carpark in front of the predominantly Muslim community centre, King Fahra Islamic centre and the Royal Museum of New South Wales

He was initially charged with common assault but the prosecutor changed their plea to assault on public decency.

Local man, Rafiq, spoke to The Advocate in Arabic, explaining that he took offence to a young man asking questions about the incident.

“He was saying that this incident was par for the course, you know what I’m saying? So I punched him in the stomach and head,” said Rafiq.

“It’s illegal. But I don’t think it’s because I am a Muslim. I reckon it’s because I am a white boy. Because he doesn’t know what’s happened. So he just called me a ‘racist cunt’ and whatever that means, I don’t care. He’s a racist fucking cunt, mate. So I decided to call him a ‘racist dummy’ and leave.”

That was about it.

But then a few times, Mr McKenzie felt like he’d strangle the man in the carpark and watch him writhe in agony until he died.

At least three times, he smashed the man’s head against the carpark wall before he was able to protect himself.

One time, he forced the man to have sex with him because he’d found a condom on the roof of a nearby nearby shop while he was out to buy new clothes for work.

It’s believed the poor man is currently in a stable condition but his family are asking that he not make any comments until he’s formally charged and gagged.

Report: Not Much Good Ever Comes Of Love It Or One Hit KO Round

TEXT:

A recent report from the Australian Bureau of Statistics has found that there isn’t much in the way of romantic chemistry that comes out of a 12-step program that teaches you to end a conversation with a smile.

In the area of love it or one hit KO, the research has revealed that the best romantic chemistry comes from a slow paced conversation.

Following a 12-step program, the participants are encouraged to engage in a low key, one-on-one conversation that they both enjoy, as well as be aware that they might not get to the point of discussing everything that they’ve learned in a small group setting.

Commenting on the research, the ABS lead researcher, Dr Kate O’Connell said:

“Over a period of 12 weeks, we asked participants to play a range of games such as: listen to one of our surveys, have a top up on a potential mate, or play a game on their phone. As a rule, if you’re running low on cash or something to get the pants on, you won’t be playing anymore games. If it was a risk, you can try to be out on the tip at some point during the next 12 weeks, but be warned, you may not get to the point where you’re not going to pay for anything if you’re under a lot of pressure.

“Participants said that playing games for cash was what they had long feared coming home. No, they weren’t actually wrong. We’re not suggesting that in any way. Just play a game for the fun of it. Come back later for the benefit of the cause if you really want to have some ‘cause we are out here,”

“It’s up to you and your partner to make the most of the experience, but no, your financial situation won’t be considered before you’re ready to start paying child support. It’s a rare occasion that happens but we’d ask that you let us know your preferred spelling is your best chance.”

The Advocate reached out to an incredibly intelligent man with a modern smartphone who’s had too much to drink and too much to dream about a career in entertainment – but he has to pick up his phone and leave the place.

“A Happy End Of Summer Showcasing Our Strength In Diversity”

TEXT:

There are a number of reasons why the beaches of Queensland look so beautiful this time of year. From the colourful sea, to the glistening corals. And yes, corals.

However, one thing that the beaches have in common with the sea is that they’re incredibly segregated.

According to the Queensland Department of Primary Industries (DPI), only about half of Queensland’s population is Aboriginal, meaning that the two communities have very different needs.

During the 2016 census, more than 78.5% of the state’s population was Aboriginal.  A similar result was reported in 2011, and up until now, it’s been exactly one thousand per cent.

Unfortunately, for the Australian recreational swimmer, the statistics don’t lie.

Threatening legal action by the Queensland Government has forced the DPI to halt their surveys until at least June. However, the one thing that they both agree on is that the state is the most multicultural state in the world.

“It’s true,” said DPI chief executive officer, Geoff Monaghan.

“Queensland is, and always has been, the most multicultural state in the world. And that’s something we want to stress, before anyone says anything,”

“We just need to do our research and only report what we can. We don’t want people to think that there’s no barriers.”

However, one local nudist, who asked to remain anonymous, says that she thinks Queensland is a lovely place to visit on your travels through the desert.

“It’s so multicultural, you know what I mean?” she said.

“You can go to any surf club, have a few schooners and be a vegan. Just leave the shoreline with your vegan friends, and go surfing with the whitewash boys. They’ve got a huge reputation there.”

Caged Bird Confirms Global Warming Has Failed Again

TEXT:

A damning report into the industry has found that it’s time to hang up the hatchet and go back to where they came.

The CAGE report was commissioned by the Australian Cattleman’s Association (ACCA) and released this morning by their office in Canberra.

The study was based on more than 2,000 hours of “in-house” research carried out by leading scientists from the University of Adelaide, Royal College of Surgeons of Australia, Royal Zoological Society of Australia, ANU, University of British Columbia and more than 25,000 interviews with owners, managers, agricultural workers and daily punters.

The report concluded that the only successful outcome from the global warming cycle was that the world will warm faster and more dramatically in the years ahead.

“The global warming narrative has failed again,” said the report, which was commissioned and funded by The Australian Cattleman’s Association.

“It’s obvious that climate change is just a Ponzi scheme,”

“The only way to make sure it doesn’t all work is to go hunting for polluting livestock, then put them to sleep in a poor state and take their inheritance from them.”

While the report has been met with widespread condemnation from both small-time cattlemen and climate change deniers, many large-scale farmers have welcomed its findings.

JIM PERSINGER, owner of North Coast Cattle Company, near Ipswich in Western Queensland, called the report ‘outrageous and irresponsible’.

“There has never been a time in my life when I don’t feel as if I’m being forced to do something,” said the 63-year-old.

“But this study has been a real eye-opener. When I was living on a farm, I was able to look the farm up and down and I couldn’t find any grazing land – in my entire lifetime,”

“So I got a pulse-warming letter from a farmer and we started paddling that mucky bit up the coast. We were thrilled when we got it back from the lorry,”

“But that’s where the job ended up. That little patch of earth became the ground water and it glitched and dried out. So our masthead started looking a bit worn from being upside down in the sun in the Northern Hemisphere. So we turned the whole thing inside out and got a bit of a new masthead – and it worked.”

Facebook To Introduce New Feature Called ‘Like' That Will Allow Users To Portrait The Note

TEXT:

Facebook will be rolling out the feature later this year where users can select either ‘like’ or ‘replies’ which will determine the picture to be sent to their friends on the Messenger app.

Facebook has today revealed the features will be rolled out in a targeted manner to users who have a high number of likes and a high number of ­replies.

The new features are set to be rolled out in a set of test apps over the coming months.

“Like” says Facebook.

“If a like is received by 10 or more people… the picture will be posted to all Facebook friends, it will be public and tagged with the relevant user information, including their name, Facebook account number and whether or not they responded to our message,”

“If a like is not received by 10 or more people… the picture will be deleted and a case will be created for deletion of the whole thing,”

“Once a case is created for deletion… the picture will be uploaded back into the Facebook pool and the case will be deleted again.”

This announcement marks a shift in social media marketing, as users have begun following up on likes and comments with calls for the picture to be deleted.

Commenters have begun following up with a case study of why they like the picture in the first place.

“You morons have killed one of the last bastions of the internet. Facebook will take it down,” writes one commenter.

“Don’t let some "political correctness" wanker [sic] tell you that it’s not OK to like the picture in the first place. They will take it down because they hate you.”

Another, who describes themselves as a ‘leftie’, writes that “what’s wrong with me is that I like the picture. That’s my opinion,”

“I need to know why you like the picture. You’re a lost cause and Facebook wants you to like it so you get more likes,” writes another.

“So you see, just like the call to ‘dismiss Australia’, the same type of thing is happening to us here at The Advocate. Don’t have your image on Facebook because we want to be the most important news source in your life.”

Malcolm Roberts Booed After Not Visiting His Auntie’s Venetian Grandmother In 10 Years

TEXT:

As many in the state are aware, The Hon. Bob Katter is no stranger to controversy.

While on the campaign trail, the retirement of his electorate’s younger members has been a hot topic for him, particularly the minority one-percenters – as he addresses the growing concerns over the natural rights of his tribal nation.

However, one issue that many are not as aware of is the fact that Bob Katter is a Vietnamese Grandmother.

Known throughout his extended family for his sterling track record as a staunch opponent to forced boat mariners, the young Senator from the Northern Territory is well known for holding several positions on issues related to immigration and other issues that he feels need to be decided on by the large numbers of Australian Australians who also feel that way.

“Is this guy even a Grandmother?” said one local voter, who asked to remain anonymous.

“I don’t know what kind of grandma he is, he’s such a kangaroo.”

“That was the first and last time I saw him, when I was in my home electorate, when I was a youth. What was he doing, visiting?”

It is believed that Mr Katter was unhappy that the mainstream media was using his heritage to try to manipulate Australians into thinking he is not a Grandmother, by stressing that he is a proud Indigenous and a member of the ­Vietnamese Grandmothers Association (VGFAA) as well as a VGFAA-accredited Vietnamese Grandmother.

Bob Katter, the man who last year pulled his hair out in the media over his wish to have same-sex marriage removed from the Constitution, says he feels very proud to be a VGFAA-accredited Vietnamese Grandmother, and to have even had the courage to call out the Greens for not respecting their agreed position on marriage equality.

“The opposition have thrown up two candidates because they don’t want to acknowledge the position that I am on and they want to run two different candidates,” Mr Katter said.

“Two different people in each race, each with a different background and experience”

“Plus, I’m not even Vietnamese, so I can’t really talk anymore about my family,”

“Also, they don’t want to acknowledge that I have a mixed heritage, because it would mean I’m not a full-blooded Australian. I’m a non-Aboriginal Grandmother”

“Also, I’m not sure what to call this guy”

However, the crown has now been passed to the stinky old man who was once the Minister for Education, and his story is one of many popular ones, many of which are not particularly interesting or exciting, but nevertheless deserving of an entire chapter of the popular horror anthology series, American Horror Story.

Although many of the allegations made against the former member of the Diamantina Shire Council are not particularly damaging to the reputation of the Catholic Church, the network behind the show has said they will be airing them nonetheless, with the exception of those involving former Prime Minister Tony Abbott.

All of the allegations currently being investigated by the three-man panel include a joke about sex with a blindfolded Edward ‘Teddy’ Baxters in a local boardroom. A conversation about ‘taking a good old-fashioned ‘dinner’.

North Shore man demands to see their doctor after trip to Dr Pepper

TEXT:

AN ANIMAL STUDY carried out by the CSIRO has confirmed the horror of the latest epidemic sweeping the North Shore of New South Wales.

Groups of much-disfigured male ibises are reported to have caused havoc on the Mid North Coast, in the Hobart region, and in the greater Northern Beaches.

One local, Andy Griffiths, says he’s sick of being treated like an intellectual by the CSIRO – and demanding scientific answers.

“They don’t know what they’re doing,” he said.

“The only thing they know is that some climate change denier rich old man is making a shitload of money off the fearmongering about the state of our climate,”

“In all honesty, I’m calling off my trip to Dr Pepper this summer. I’ve got sick of this junk,”

“I’m not coming all the way to Dr Pepper, with all the virus that my wife has just laid dormant in my colon for three weeks. I’m going to get my GI or something up,”

The NSW inquiry found that 95% of people with flu-like symptoms had had either spent their entire life in a public health professional’s warm room, or had been in a GP’s waiting room.

The most prominent example of the latter was Dr R.J. Mackay, a British medical doctor and environmental health specialist.

“Dr Robert has been a close friend of mine for many years,”

“He’s a warm, welcoming man with a great sense of humour. When we’re at the Gabba, he always has a good time with us,”

However, the research found that Dr R.J. was more often seen in a courtroom than at a GP’s.

Another local, Dr Jaydynne, a fellow West Hobart bioethicist, said that he had been stung by Dr Mackay’s scientific prowess on a number of occasions.

“When we’re at the pub down at the Trough, he says ‘Shit!’ whenever I tell him something, like what I do for a living, or the way I’ve got my shit sorted at the CSIRO,”

“I’m getting sick of it, I’m calling off my trip to Dr Pepper and all the fancy things I’ve been known to do over the years. The sweet spot of free-market science and public health is usually near the edge of my right lung,”

“Otherwise, I’m good with the shit.”

Since joining her in her new lifestyle, Grace has found it difficult to keep a close eye on how much she has been eating in her latest Instagram post.

“That’s gotta be close to 20 kilos” she says, with a smirk.

“And the fact that I am wearing a good pair of skinny jeans with a nice fit and no wrinkling. A must for me”

We asked Grace about a possible solution for the problem of her weight gain, to which she admitted that she did not want to give it up.

“I don’t know, I am not 100% committed to losing weight for no reason, but I’ve got to try to put some of that excess to good use”

“For people like me, who have been conditioned to think that being fat is a sign of weakness, and weakness is a sign of health, it’s important to keep that in check”

“I’m just not paying for the same old shit for years on Instagram. That’s just a whole different level”

Alarming number of suicide bombs discovered in abandoned Melbourne apartment

TEXT:

A SYDNEY PAPER is still held by authorities in Melbourne after a heavy police presence was made necessary to try and contain a string of suicide hotspots, which exploded over the weekend.

On Saturday, a man walked out of the Australian Federal Police offices in Macquarie Park and opened fire on a large crowd of young people, killing two and wounding more.

Police have said the man opened fire through the glass front window of his car as he tried to leave the scene. The car was riddled with bullets, some lodged in the driver’s side.

The number of suicide hotspots in the complex became unmanageable as emergency crews were called to the building at approximately 12:30am on Sunday morning.

The complex is close to the notorious Kennel Hill Road finish line, which means people who enjoy the drug-fuelled havoc that comes with an athletic build and suntanning, have nowhere else to go other than the complex.

The silvery-haired, black-eyed youth that opened fire on Saturday made it out of the building alive.

A post shared by Leon Russell (@leon.r.r.o.trainer) on Jun 8, 2017 at 5:38pm PDT

The secret to preventing these massive shootings is to find a peaceful way to die, whether it be a pedestrian, a cyclist, a soldier or an EEL canoeist.

It’s also worth noting that Sydney’s inner suburbs are one of the safest in the world, and the same cannot be said of their outer suburbs.

Married Bloke At Least Not Pretty As It Seems

TEXT:

A local married man who has spent the last few years inside a marriage that isn’t his has done a good job of presenting himself as a man who looks like he could probably give someone with basic medical knowledge a proper blow job.

The fact that he has done this despite the fact he has been outside of marriage for far too long and has never looked like he could be a competent surgeon is a testament to his charming personality and sense of humour.

The fact that he has also never once made a decent fist-pumping gesture is a testament to his mental capacity.

The man himself, Tony Peter (32) says he has found himself falling asleep during lectures and conversations. He says it’s not because he is a guilty narcissist who just doesn’t get it about life or the world around him, but because he is probably the last person you would be able to talk to about something that you actually care about.

“I’ve had a couple girlfriends get me off on the wrong side of the story,” he says.

“Like, if I see some bloke with a big bar of coffee for a Monday morning dinner, I’d probably just brush my stubble and not even say ‘Gonorrhea',”

“I guess I’m just one of the guys. My mates are the same, they think I’m a real soft cock but anyway, that’s how I roll.”

A group of equally chipper but equally confused women, who aren’t the same age as Tony, say they can’t really talk anymore because they’re going to have to have a decent conversation with him.

“How do you pronounce ‘dea-za-za-za-za?” asked Ruth, the group chat’s oldest member.

“Did you just say ‘za-zah-za?”

Tony also makes a point of complimenting his women, saying that they are real women, and that they can talk about anything.

“I’m just saying, you know what I’m talking about?” he says.

“You are like me. You’re thinking like me!”

French Quarter Estate Owners Must Do More Than Pick Up Broken Beer, Dislodge Feral Dogs

It’s what the French Quarter do.

Angela Schroeder (62) lives in the French Quarter with her husband Wilbur and they’ve enjoyed a quiet, peaceful little corner of the district for close to a decade now.

Though the edge of the French Quarter has seen great economic and social growth, the fragile peace is what the Schroeder family live for.

“It’s the Friday night wine stops,” says Angela.

“The weeknight special and the occasional Saturday day.”

With the city’s late-night nightlife largely ignored by a city that’s still barely producing a weekend, despite what the suburbs have to offer, it’s not just the nightlife that she loves – it’s the fact that it was going for before she left.

“Oh, I’ve been to the Reserve Club three times this year. That must be what they do down in the Old City district. It’s such a safe, comfortable place. It’s where they fuck you,”

The Schroeder family aren’t alone in their unease.

Nearly every single house in the French Quarter is currently experiencing the same issues.

Local gent, Josie Shaw (55), who’s currently still live-in-with her late-night sleeping partner, says that when she’s at home with her husband and kids, she often wonders why there’s no wild nights partying in the Quarter.

“It’s not that the district isn’t nice. It’s just that there’s nowhere for the kids to go. You know, the suburbs just aren’t right,” says Josie.

“They need to get out here and do some real damage. They need to start vandalising cars, smashing windows and taking up hiking. That’s what they do in nature,”

“I’ve seen it happen with the river and sewerage pipes. You can go to a homeless shelter and a scrawled out death threat will hit you right in the fucking head. That’s the real problem,”

“And then the city, what happens there, you know. People are really lucky to escape the head-swipe. It’s really hard to find a nice place in this area to have a nice, safe night.”

“I think they’re being stupid.”

Gay Rights Withdrawal In Sydney Happening Now

TEXT:

After a 12 month hiatus, the general public are waking up to the fact that the NSW state government is homophobic again.

With the dropping of the long-panned #BanTheBowl movement and the rise of the ‘No-Kiss-The-Bowl’ movement – the LGBTI community in Sydney are beginning to notice the signs of a withdrawal.

With a massive backlash to the odd-coupling, a steady decline in mainstream politics, and a huge clampdown on domestic violence, gay rights are beginning to look like a last resort.

The day is 1777 and the streets of Sydney are lined with gay community leaders, politicians and movement members as their paladin fleet tugs swashbuckled across the harbour city.

With the blessing of the gay community, the homosexual community have made the decision to withdraw from the streets of Sydney.

The same cannot be said for the local union, which has already declared that it will fight the new laws – but it is most definitely not going to vote for the Blue, Brown or Orange, in a by-election.

“It’s sad and disappointing that the community isn’t really all that interested in being represented in the capital city anymore,” said a spokesperson for the ACTU, who has no real power on this issue.

“Who is going to save the day? The party or the community?”

This comes after the NSW government conceded last week that they needed a more accurate gauge of public sentiment than the opinion polls, which is something the LGBTI community are very much against.

“People think the polls are bullshit and that the ABC and Sun are biased,” said the government’s polling director, Aileen Wuornos.

“They’re all just lies. The polls are pure fiction and the public don’t actually like the Liberals because they actually believe the polls. They can’t believe what they’re reading,”

Uncle Tony X And His First Family Surprise Family Members At Parliament House

Despite growing up in a stable middle-class family with a strong track record of good with kids that respect their mum, Uncle Tony X has reportedly had a dream come true today after his wife entered the house for dinner.

During the prime minister’s annual Christmas Day address, the nation’s least-hated figurehead was on hand to deliver a special message to the nation’s ‘non-whites’ – telling them that they are welcome here and that they should not be ashamed.

Although known to make headlines for his hard-right views on a number of issues, including climate change, non-White Australians are, in reality, just non-White and not really a concern for the Liberal Party.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison says he doesn’t think Uncle Tony is the reason that Black people don’t feel comfortable associating with them.

He points out that the powerful member for Warringah has made a career of chiding, threatening and bullying non-White people for no good reason.

“You don’t become a Liberal, you become a Liberal to begin with. You don’t become a Liberal to be politically incorrect, you become a Liberal to be racist, you become a Liberal because you are afraid to be politically incorrect. You become a Liberal because your husband stops calling you names when you aren’t ready, you become a Liberal because your cousins have been caught having sex with a Chinese girl…”

“…and the rest is pretty much the same.”

Mr Abbott has since asked Mr Turnbull to stop at some point – but refuses to elaborate on what that means.

Finance Professionals Praying That Victorian Greens Ban Gold Replacements During The Gold Rush

TEXT:

As the fossil fuel lobby and Western Queensland politicians enter unchartered waters over the gold replacement policy, some old boys in the mining sector are asking themselves if this state-enforced labor aristocracy is truly our ancestors are in the early stages of the first family.

This comes after the Gold Rush of 1748 was massively escalated by the rash of destimulating Victorian girls, who used up a wealth of local gold, transported to the New World from the Black Sea coast, by large ships carrying ore from the Asian continent.

The arrival of large European ships and the rise of European immigrant communities within a few decades of the Gold Rush of 1748 have their footprints all over the Australian landscape, according to early historians, who say that they aren’t on the same side.

The advocates for a local, high-quality agricultural workforce, say they will keep up the pressure on the Australian Greens Party, whether it be the controversial fracking, or the ongoing flow of gold out of the ground in Western Queensland.

Today’s announcement that there will be an immediate ban on the practice of mining and burning any form of fossil fuels will also apply to any new business or community coming in within 100 kilometres of the state’s borders.

“The fact that Victorian Greens leaders are refusing to provide an appropriate environment for our coal mine and coal ship shows that they are not even remotely interested in the safety of our communities and their immediate environment,” said a well-heeled philanthropic grandpa from a prominent small business.

“If it wasn’t for Victorians threatening to strike, your local Greens would have been able to offer a special leave without a work stoppage and with the warning that you will be unemployed if you walk out,”

“But, we don’t trust the Greens to actually do anything to protect our communities, let alone the environment.”

“Until that happens, I will be taking my holidays with my family down to Western Queensland, unless the Greens believe this state is in line with their concerns,”

“You know what they should do? Get a real job!”

The nation’s most senior judges, barristers and elected officials, all agree that the political earthquake that triggered the current Coalition Government’s unprecedented ethics scandal was an unjustifiable result of the Kevin Rudd’s election.

However, the mainstream Australian media, including ABC and Guardian, is equally as culpable, as their reporting on the facts has been left un-coincidentally (or uncorrupted) by ABC executives, many of whom are still employed by the highest-paid public servants in the country.

But it’s all a bit of a blur right now, as the Coalition finds themselves scrambling to explain a failed leadership challenge, and subsequent bank holiday to show just how desperate they are to continue with a minor premiership.

The Advocate‘s Senior Editor, David Leyonhjelm, spoke to The Advocate shortly after the result of the election became clear.

“If Kevin Rudd wins, and the next thing you know, he’s the Prime Minister of Australia, you’ll have lost. You can’t even call an election on a credit card until you get some serious news,”

“And it’s a national disgrace that our country has elected a left-wing prime minister who’s spent eight years making war with Muslim countries, before there’s even been a Labour government,”

“It’s good news, if you ask me.”

After revealing to The Advocate that he’s still in touch with the people of Australia’s middle-class, senior figures within the ABC are pleading with other executives to send them some good news – as a result of the election.

The 28-year-old was just beginning his shift when the assistant manager came up to greet him, offering him a coffee, telling him that he’d noticed the fumes from the car heater in the corner of the office.

“What’s the point of working for those giant multinationals,” he said.

“Who’s the problem? The sole reason why these big blue suits are still around? Because they let them work as secretaries? So we can fuck the fuck out of them with the benefits! Oh yeah, that old school Irish bloke at the desk is just ruining everything for us,”

“That’s the skinny on him. Not to mention the fact that he just broke the law again last week, going out on the balcony to get a new watch and the bottle on a stick, or whatever the fuck that thing costs. He knows all our rules and he can’t help us but he won’t even look at the small details. What’s he even smoking for? You’ll get to see! We’ll do whatever he tells us!”

Joey Boggs had to step in and offer his two cents, but the 28-year-old said that wasn’t enough – that’s what Australia’s corporate elites are into.

He pulled a few cold ones out of a tall office at the Betoota Dolphins Leagues Club and slid them into his belt.

He then laughed nervously as he looked at his watch.

“Fuck, it’s almost 9 here. Not bad aye. Better for me than Jack Jones,” he said.

“I’ll make sure I’m on the front foot when the morning comes around,”

“Just don’t say you’ve got a full complement of juices and nothing to talk about.”

Local Woman With Sticky Tongs Praying It’ll Hang Dry For Another Day

TEXT:

A prominent local businesswoman with an eye-catching stinky Tongs syndrome has been doing it tough this week as the Sunday back pain intensifies and worsens further. 

When we asked Lucy Marshall-Ross about this recent rash of upper back pain, she told us that it’s only a matter of time until it gets better. 

“Ahhh.” Lucy said moments ago to us over the phone. 

“As a patient with Tongs syndrome, I’m praying for the best for it to go away,” she said. 

“But I can’t just wait until it dries out.” 

“I can’t believe the syringes keep coming out.” 

“Why don’t you put some bleach in them. I can’t imagine what it feels like to wash my hands with water and whatnot, but I’m praying it dries out quickly,” Lucy said. 

“Especially because I’ve had to twice wash my hands twice, once just for the lintels and now I’m praying for the Tongs to dry out completely.” 

“If it doesn’t dry out, I’m going to put some of the sticky stuff in the coffee grounds I keep for me now to be able to wash my hands,” Lucy said. 

“It’s starting to look like it’s going to wet again.” 

Lucy’s niece Kristin asked Lucy if she was praying for her Tongs to dry out completely – to which Lucy said she could, and she’s starting to do it anyway. 

“It’s very weird because I get them over and they dry out. But I don’t just put in some bleach, I put in the Galah [sic] Honey – and they start to get really itchy and itchy again.” 

“But I’m praying for it to dry out so I can get itchy again,” Lucy said. 

“Maybe I’ll start picking the bananas and things and stuff in the gardening, too.” 

“But yeah, it’s only a matter of time.”

Uncertain Father Spends A Few Days Making Three-Quarter White Bread Pasties

TEXT:

DESPITE BEING AT LARGE in her 40-something years, Margaret Whitebread isn’t afraid to go to the shops with her kids.

Not even the big old dumb older woman who’s going to her local petrol station to sell the last of her hand-me-downs, preferring to have her own restaurant instead.

Despite giving birth to five children, including two children of her own choosing, the retired grey-haired former-septuagenarian is still fresh in her hips and happy to go to the shops when her husband breaks a hip or starts coughing up a couple of dollars for a lunch special.

“That white bread is just as good as anything you can find in this big supermarket,” said Margaret, a popular midwife.

“There’s literally no better for a healthy breakfast than a three-quarter white one, just like the store. Especially the healthy ones,”

“That and a litre of milk and a quarter of a jug of heavy cream and a packet of butter. Or a box of smokes for the Sunday lunch.”

However, the husband of nine has spoken out this morning to The Advocate that he’s always had a dark, and he’s not about to change anything.

“I’m going to be getting a three-quarter white one,” said Derek.

“That should be about as healthy as you can get without a packet of smokes or anything,”

“And a litre of milk and a quarter of a jug of heavy cream and a box of smokes for lunch. Honestly, there’s not much better for you than a three-quarter white one.”

Our reporter spoke to Margaret this morning in the front carpark of the local supermarket, just as Derek was about to buy a packet of smokes for lunch.

She explained that she’s not going to change anything and she’s just going to get a white one.

“Yeah, I’m just going to get a fucking white one,” she said.

“So what if I’m still working when I’m buying that packet of smokes?”

“I’m not asking for much, I just want to get my husband back.”

Social Media Leader Retires Media Session To Deal With Next Part Of This Article

TEXT:

TECH N9, a company that trades on its users and sells them useless, disposable plastic breast augmentation kits at every service, has just asked two of their employees to move to a lower-paid position to help ease the strain on the company’s coffers.

The employee who asked the question was Marcia Peterson, and the subsequent reply was a polite nod and an assuring smile – the exchange.

The next part of this article is a bit more murky.

“That’s the first thing I do,” Marcia told her colleagues. “Get the wheels in motion. The worst thing for the company is when we have to pull people aside for interviews, and spend their money to get to the bottom of something that could've gone away.”

“But I think there’s a better way to deal with these people and a happier way to make them feel better about themselves.”

“Trust me. I’ve seen it happen with the new account managers, so I’m in a position to help them out.”

“But that’s all in the past. Next week, the lower-paid admin positions will be posted on a bucket ship to Port Douglas’ offices in the French Quarter, just out of the way.”

Bloke Who Shows Impression Australians Are Ready For Change

TEXT:

A local Adam Smith-style Australian has today called on all Australians to stay strong in the fight against change. 

The local business owner, Blake Johnston (45), spoke to The Advocate about his long-awaited victory and the importance of being a constant reminder of what Australian culture is all about. 

“We are changing,” he said. 

“Whether it be through social media, or the newspaper, or whatever it takes, the way we communicate our message is through our hashtag” 

“Twitter is the easiest to change, it’s like, the easiest, and most powerful thing to change. And it’s a mighty snake, once you’ve got your handle on it.” 

“Australia is a great country, and I love this country, but we have to be strong.” 

“This is the only way we can stay true to our roots.”

The changing communications landscape for people who don’t believe in change is also one that has caught the attention of the ABC’s Four Corners program, which was made aware of the trend of uni students walking around with pins and chains on their shoes. 

The next segment of the program went into greater detail about the belief that Australia is moving towards becoming less and less democratic, which Mr Johnston was quick to address. 

“We’ve got to be strong in our fight against change,” he said. 

“Because I’m a market research firm, I’m looking at you,” he said referring to the ABC program that offers analysis, stories and analysis on everything from political instability to global warming to the Australian election. 

“So if you don’t believe in change, that means you don’t believe in the Australian way of life,” he said referring to the fact that Australia is perhaps the most multicultural nation on earth. 

“Australia is a great country, and I love this country, but we have to be strong.” 

“This is the only way we can stay true to our roots.” 

“Australia is a great country, and I love this country, but we have to be strong.”

ABC To Produce Trendy New Stereo Podcasts In iOS

TEXT:

Despite little interest from the wider Australian podcast community, the ABC has this week announced it will be producing a number of interesting new podcasts in an attempt to overtake the growth of both their user numbers and podcast audience.

Among the announced titles will be the Skewers Comprehension, The Dish’s Jazz and Pynchon.

At the same time, the ABC has today revealed that they will be producing a number of more traditional radio shows, such as the Seven Deadly Sins, Bill Shorten Live, and the annual Bruce Springsteen biopic The Hamilton Album.

The ABC say they’re keen to produce new content that will appeal to people who weren’t previously their audience.

“We’ve got to make room for all these well-heeled, egocentric people who just enjoy listening to people talk about politics and whatnot,” a spokesperson said.

“They don’t necessarily listen to us because they enjoy seeing politicians and other related subjects get passionate about something they don’t understand,”

“But yeah, we’re going to be producing a few shows that’d normally be heard only by people who have one of those two things in common, a propensity to vote Green, and an ability to speak in tongues,”

“So that’s what we’re going to be producing.”

The Advocate reached out to both the ABC and the BBC for comment but only received an out of office autoreply from the latter stating that “You don’t get the ABC as much as you think you do”.

Abbott: “Bill Shorten has shown he is capable of handling a dagger”

TEXT:

Former Prime Minister Tony Abbott has called for Opposition leader Bill Shorten to “sink a dagger in the heart of Liberal Party culture” – just days after he made headlines to publicly humiliate the leader of the opposition by accusing him of being a “dagger”.

Mr Abbott made the comments as he pitched for the Liberal party to be silent on the allegation that he was a “dagger”.

“Bill Shorten has shown that he is capable of handling a dagger,” Mr Abbott said.

“That’s why I’m asking the party to be quiet, to say nothing about it. Let him get away with it, then let him explain his point of view,”

“Dagger culture, or something like it.”

The comments come as the Opposition leader takes aim at all of his rivals for the role of Opposition leader, saying he is the only one who can stop him from doing the whole thing.

Mr Abbott, who returned to politics as a Liberal federal member in 1991 after a ten-year career in the upper reaches of the NSW Liberal Party, said he would continue to fight for the Liberal Party to ensure that he was never the leader of the party.

“You get two choices, either resign and go work for Peter Dutton as the leader of the opposition, or you get to run as a independent with the Liberals,” Mr Abbott told the Opposition Leader.

“Whatever path you take, it’ll never be a Liberal Party member, so keep fighting and you’ll get the nod,”

“The Liberal Party is the only place where you’ll get the nod and the only place where you’ll get the nod.”

Abbott Says Any Vote On One, Whether It Be For Or Against, Will Be Justified By Family

TEXT:

Former Prime Minister Tony Abbott has today reiterated that his entire political legacy is now on shaky ground, after a rift emerged between his right and left wing factions over the issue of same-sex marriage.

“Every time a gay or gay-for-sex is on the question, any meaningful policy will result from either a tie or a win for the Coalition”

The Former Prime Minister went on to explain that no one in his party is prepared to support the concept of marriage equality.

“In fact, no one is prepared to support marriage equality, because it’s either a one-off, or a one-off in opposition. Because as I understand it, the core of the religious and social community in the country has it in for some straight white men, and not for some gay white men”

Abbott has also suggested that even if the majority of his party were to vote against same-sex marriage, the Government would still have a majority.

“If everyone votes against it, the question will be moot, and the whole debate will become moot. Unless my Dad somehow convinces the Australian people that we need to ban gay marriage – which he can’t”

“So please, don’t tell my wife”

Morrison Administers Emergency NHS Handjob After Being Called An Asexual Cock Puppet For No Reason

TEXT:

The opposition leader of Australia, Bill Shorten, has been treated by the emergency services this afternoon after a guy walked up to him in the Melbourne Athletic Club Men’s Room and asked for a peck on the cheek.

The deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, was also present and went through his wallet and turned his card to pay for it, knowing that it was about to be turned over to the service.

“Just give me a sign, son,” said the 28-year-old.

“You’ll have to give it to the lad if you want to get it. I’m not that nice of a blokes man,”

“The police would be coming after you but the Aussies are good. That’s where you’ve got to be. I can’t wait to get out there and knock some heads.”

Mr Joyce then proceeded to show his card to the victim and keep walking back to the bar.

Following the above discussion, the accused became sexually active with the victim as well as another young woman in the men’s room.

They are now happily a couple years into a relationship and Mr Joyce was quick to point out that the whole experience was more about an Aussie spirit of giving.

“A cock puppet is one of those odd fish things that only very rich and very *very old* people have,” he said.

“You know the feeling of one? It’s like a shark out of water, man. But you know it’s also like a pair of hands getting snipped at by a skinny dud on the shaft,”

“These are some of the things you can get from being a cock puppet, in my opinion.”

“I Just Get It!”: Port Adelaide Fan Can’t Wait For 2018 Season To Start

TEXT:

A year-long study conducted by the Australian Football League has revealed that the vast majority of AFL fans in regional and suburban areas would rather root than watch any of the teams in the competition next season.

As was the case with the 2011 Grand Final winners and the 2008 Commonwealth Games gold-medal winners, the vast majority of AFL fans would rather root than watch any of the Port Adelaide Football Club.

The VFL was established in the early 1970s as an alternative to rugby league and the competition has not really been around for very long, so it’s not like it’s been around for very long – but fans still cheer for it, even when their state doesn’t have a team.

The leader of the Port Adelaide Football Club, David Koch, spoke to The Advocate today about the study.

“Yeah look,” he laughed.

“It’s not like we are on the losing side of a coin as much as the winning side. But even then, I think you’d be surprised. These Port Adelaide supporters aren’t making fun of themselves like we do,”

“They know there’s only one team left and they’re the only team that will win the whole competition. Aussie rule. In fact, they’re the only team that could take the title. So whatever, I don’t really care if they win the AFL, they’ll win the Cessnock,”

“What I do care about is that their side don’t want to win. That’s what matters. The mentality of their footy club and their team. We want to win. We just don’t want to win. We’re only human.”

Koch then laughed again before adding a final flourish for the sponsor.

“That’s it! They don’t want to win!”

The ad is already doing the rounds in regional newspapers and on social media.

Tony Abbott announces royal commission into Aboriginal education

TEXT:

IN THE WESTERN NSW HAWKS no more than a thousand people, could become as many as three million under his government’s proposed royal commission into the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Education.

There will be 3,000 state-appointed royal commissioners to investigate complaints about schools funding and staff. The commission will also investigate complaints about schools funding and governance.

Calls have been made to abolish the Commission as well as abolish the Education Minister – a suggestion that has been met with hysteria by the Catholic Church, the Rabbinical Council of Australia, and the NSW State Government.

However, the Premier of the nation’s Indigenous state, the most senior politician in the country, says he thinks there will be reforms to be put in place.

Brett McGurk said the Premier has been clear about the possibility of a royal commission into the schooling of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, but nothing has happened.

But that has left the Prime Minister with an unexpected benefit – after winning the election with a super majority of his own, which he plans to continue using until his dying breath.

Brett McGurk: As an Indigenous male, I know a lot of the people in your electorate, and I know that the fact that you have appointed a royal commission into schools funding and staff is not going to stop me from contacting your parents and High Priestess. I know you want to make a difference. If you are reading this, then I ask that you please take a moment to read through my letter to the Betoota Advocate and consider whether you want to be part of my present legal battle? If yes, I’ll be very happy to listen to your view. If no, I’ll call you and you’ll get on the other side of the street and I’ll move on.

Tooheys Classic Now A Qualified Cancer For Women

TEXT:

A spokeswoman from the Australian Conservation Boomers’ Alliance (ACCBA) has today announced that the long-awaited Tooheys Classic is now officially a qualified health condition for women – after a study was carried out into the health benefits of the brew.

The results of the study were released earlier this year and have been confirmed by the Australian Society of Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ASM).

The new study’s findings were that the iconic Tooheys Classic is good for you, on a plant-based diet, with a higher fibre content, which is good for you and your health.

“This means that you should drink it in the usual way, with a little bit of honey and/or stevia.”

“That’s also recommended.”

Professor Hank Kruger from the CSM explained that the high levels of fibre found in the CSM’s own personal research over the years has been corroborated by the scientific community.

“We just make it so we don’t have to cook, but if you can’t eat meat and can’t listen to music – you should drink the milk with a little bit of jelly.”

“That should do the trick for everyone.”

Conceptual Indigenous Indian Queen

TEXT:

Dressed in a predominantly white thong, long johns and a trendy black Kangol hat, Claudia Coote was the ultimate embodiment of the traditional cultural practices of Australia’s traditional inhabitants.

Her elegant minority status, coupled with her praised for her ability to communicate through a quirky, but ultimately beautiful voice, meant that she had tremendous leverage in any negotiation she had with Indigenous Australians.

Claudia Coote was one of a new breed of Indigenous women that we should all be very wary of. 

Especially if they were dealing with a Kiwi of a mate or something. 

Claudia, as she was more commonly known, was one of the original Mona Lisa Monogamous royalists, a late 1800’s inter-tribal bard that transcended the traditional ways of doing business in Canberra and struck fear into the hearts of those who felt threatened by new laws that threatened to wipe out a long-standing cultural institution, and perhaps a few other things that we don’t really care about.

In other words, a very homogeneous type of person.

Her progressive activism has resulted in her being compared to Occupy Canberra, by those who weren’t even part of that movement, for daring to have a different opinion from the likes of the WestConnex and PUP.

She was also the one that coined the term ‘Enlightened Aunty’, an ancient and sacred Indigenous phrase that can only be said by Auntys of aristocratic background.

Most popular amongst the Western Indigenous aristocracy, the phrase ‘enlightened aunty’ has been used as a pre-emptive insult to all female Indigenous Australians, for a way more complex reason.

The way it can be said is with a hip hop or other popular music beat that has a high pitched pitched nasal snarl, as well as the slight chuckle that accompanied the comment.

Her sister Shona says it is one of those moments when you just have to listen.

“It’s so funny” she says.

“I mean I am Indigenous, but”

“I know that my family has been in the bush for 30,000 years and I am not as educated as the rest of my family, but I still think it is so funny that every time I hear a nana or maroon, or a lexican, or a straight edge I just have to laugh”

The National party, the party of Australia, still isn’t very accepting of Ms Coote’s arguments that everything they are trying to do is just to help out Indigenous Australians.

The Liberal party is as follows:

Local woman already thinking about buying a house but not so much of it yet

TEXT:

Not every young local woman is planning to take off her twin-wristed moleskin top and make a move on the roof top, she told The Advocate via Skype this morning.

Diane Jackson, who graduated from The Bachelor at the age of 24 in April, isn’t yet ready to commit to a mate who has a family, a home and a plan on living within 50 minutes of the nearest train station, said she’s already thinking about buying a house but not quite yet.

“I’m going to have a little bit of a look at this year’s pool,” she said.

“I’ve already talked to the bank about it and they said they’d be sort of more interested in watching what sort of champagne sprays the next year if I don’t get a house. So I’m getting all my apartment/house prices and all my house prices and house prices in February. Then it’s a big freeze for a year,”

“But I’ll have a nice, small pool house for Christmas, then a nice house for New Year’s. I don’t know, it might be too good to be true. I’m not ready to leave the deregulated Sydney whore-house-industrial-complex.”

However, the inner city implores to know that, as young women, these days are becoming much more well-known for not marrying for a sense of self-respect, than for their ability to provide for their children and husband.

“This is the first time I’ve ever seen my mother ask me not to be a good man. She’s made me a LNP member for life. But I’m not feeling it yet.”

Our reporter went to see the young lady on Sunday morning where she sat quietly by herself in a park for half a day.

“Why do you ask me to be a man?” she asked the kindly young man.

“Don’t put a chip on me. I’m already a good man. Why would I marry a man?”

“Men can be good if you know what I mean. Why do I ask you to be a man?”

Our reporter nodded.

“But I don’t.”

Introverted Millennial Grudgingly Agrees With Gay-Rights Activist Tweet

TEXT:

Local Millennial, Brendan Colbran, is openly critical of the current LGBTI community – but isn’t just any Millennial – he’s a straight up blue-ribbon progressive.

The 28-year-old hospitality professional says he’s no longer comfortable with their ‘don’ vote for same-sex marriage’ – he’s a member of his generation who’s spent their entire lives ‘fucking’ a different community for political gain – and this is his opinion

“I just don’t get it, mate. They’ve got every right to be pissed off with us, but that’s not my problem, is it?” he said.

“Or their problem is not my problem, my problem is their problem. But they’ve labelled us as ‘left-faction’ which is a huge stretch from what my generation is all about. It’s just not my problem, my generation is just not left,”

“The left of centre is not part of the LGBTI community. There’s plenty of us left and they have their own agenda, so we’re not racist just like the Aussie left,”

“How did you become a member of the LGBTI?” he asks our reporters.

Our reporters say they’ve got no idea because they can’t get the details of how people became members of the LGBTI because it’s illegal and the whole thing is political crap.

They also have no idea why Brendan doesn’t think that same-sex marriage is something we should support – because his generation has helped promote it.

“We’ve got all this wonderful equality for women and equal rights for gays. I don’t think that’s what the left would support,”

“Did you know a generation ago, that the public were very cautious about women coming into their cities to be so full-time public servants,”

“I’m just not that uptight.”

Coastie Island Tourist Attends Sydney Climate Summit To Find Out What Man This Town Is

TEXT:

A tourist who’s just arrived in Sydney’s Harbour City is already on the wrong side of the 'Townsville, Parramatta, and Mt Coot-tha issues’ he was raised in the Townsville, Parramatta, and Mt Coot-tha’s movement, but not the Australian way.

The coastal icon is facing a city that’s made up of a pair of cast-iron sconces, a beach cottage, a houseboat, and a handful of cocktail hostships – in terms of how you could describe it.

The choice to book a cruise ship trip is important, considering the five hours you’ll spend on the beach and the five hours you’ll spend in the holiday hotspot.

If you’re not keen on the idea of the political correctness-kissing green left to protest, there are plenty of other options available to you, including sitting at home and watching two hours of Sky News and then calling your mum’s phone.

Whether or not you want to pay $700 for a bus fare to another town, or if you just want to see the whole thing from the top of a headland, the decision to spend your money on this cruise ship tour and not the flight to a more cosmopolitan city will soon be moot.

Malcolm Turnbull To Spend $250m On Cracking Down On Gun Registration This Year

TEXT:

In an effort to stamp his authority on the Australian people, Former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has announced today that he will be joining forces with an array of groups fighting for common sense gun legislation this Christmas.

The news comes after the Member For Warringah committed to spending $250 million of his own money over the next few months to crack down on gun registration in the nation’s urban centres.

The New South Wales Senator says he has good relations with gun owners, but agrees with his supporters that more needs to be done to help prevent guns from getting into the wrong hands.

“For me, the gun owner, the rights are absolute and absolute to own a firearm,” says Turnbull.

“The common sense, reasonable measures to protect against gun ownership are getting a bit out of control. The gun lobby are again mis-informed,”

“And like I said, there is a small subset of the Australian people that I would want to work with. But for the first time in my life, I don’t think we can ever have a smooth relationship.”

It’s understood that the former Prime Minister will be spending close to a quarter of his $250 million dollar a year on gun control lobbying, before the next election, to ensure that they have a seat at the table, if needed.

However, the Government says Turnbull has done his research into what gun owners actually want.

“The most common sentiment among gun owners is, ‘I’m tired of seeing needless violence and mass shootings,’” says a press release from the Government.

“Our nation’s gun owners want to make it clear that they are gun owners first and foremost,”

“Gun ownership and other Second Amendment rights are of no concern to us.”

Mature Age Ex-Coupled Man Doesn’t Really Need To Watch Much TV If He Doesn’t Care About What She Does

TEXT:

A local mature age divorced man says he’s not really that invested in what his wife watches on television, at least not right now – after being dumped by his now ex-wife for being too old for television.

It’s a strange feeling, one that Jason Fitzgerald (36) says he’s never really been in the position to be able to watch a show with his family around him.

“For years she’s been pushing me to watch more shows… Especially shows with older women… Like some type of family shows”

“I mean, I don’t need this type of distraction, I’m 65. And that’s fine, I don’t need to be spoiled by my wife’s television, I don’t need to be dragged away to binge watch shows with my kids, or watch shows with my wife. She’s the one that ‘came on’ when I was going through a tough patch”

“I mean, we’re not in a relationship with any type of structured television or movies, but I’m sure she’s still on the brain when I’m getting choked up about that old man who’s really fucking gay.”

Jason, who was publicly excommunicated from the ministry at the age of 27 after his ex-wife left him for a gay man, says he was in a state of shock when he found out that his ‘leader’ from that show, Simon, was gay.

“He was pretty straight forward with his sexuality though, you know? That’s all I was thinking. They’re two of the main characters in the show, but I was thinking he might be a lesbian.”

“Yeah, but he’s not. And it’s not like we don’t care about his sexuality. We just want him to get better but he’s so old to do that anyway,”

Man Who Cuts Down Trees For Shit She Brought It

However, it seems that Patrick is just as guilty of being as he is of being a paralegal and does not want to be blamed for anything, even if it was his doing.

A study conducted by the Betoota Grove Landscaper’s Association [BGLA] has found that approximately 80% of all get-togethers Patrick was part of ended with him cutting down trees for shit.

“It’s just not true. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with cutting down trees for money” he said.

“Especially when you’re saving for a house in Betoota Grove, or for shit, you don’t need to do it.”

Patrick then went on to claim that he doesn’t get paid and that his family is not on the up and up.

Tony Abbott says Muslims don’t deserve equal rights under the constitution

TEXT:

Tony Abbott has hit out at the idea of making a distinction between religion and politics today, telling ABC’s The Nightly Telegraph that Muslims are people too – and that if you don’t like it, you might have a better fit working in politics.

The attorney-general-turned-politician spoke to the paper in his electorate of Hobart, where he has had a relatively easy life with no public service or university connections.

He was asked to address the remarks today after the Islamic community rallied in support of a Jewish classmate at a school shooting incident.

“Mate, the people that come here from all different backgrounds, whether they be Catholic, Protestant, Jewish or Muslim, they all love sport,” said Abbott.

“And they are not all Muslims, we aren’t all Muslim, they are all just people. How dare you say that, they aren’t equal,”

“They are different, and their religions are different. But they are human. They are human. That’s my opinion. If you are not happy with me, say so. But don’t try and sit there and yell hate about Muslims for being a bunch of soft c**ts, that’s how you should feel. You don’t belong here.”

A local community leader spoke up, saying that it’s pretty clear the Islamic community love rugby and footy, and are quite keen to join us in our attacks on the abus.

Shayne Smythe, of the Ville de la Pisse Dans Ma Poche Camp, said there are no differences between the different religions, and he couldn’t understand why Mr Abbott was treating them so differently.

“He’s just trying to appeal to their same-ness. How does this bother us?” said the Ville’s Mayor.

“Why should they be different? I’m the only one here that knows about it. They are equal, but they don’t understand that. They are just c**ts.”

However, he woke to a room full of his family’s towels, having done all the washing in the kitchen sink, and a loaf of bread in the dining room.

“It is a nice place,” he said.

“But in town, you can’t get that nap you get in the suburbs. It’s too close to the city. I’m sorry for saying that, I just don’t like being too close to the city. But it’s too much to be a one-horse town. So my vote is against change this weekend,”

Lucky Nightclub Host Gets A Good Angle On The Bouncers As Private School Student

TEXT:

On the opening night of a new school term at South Betoota Polytechnic College, a 32-year-old banking student gets the feel of the venue.

Peter Johnson, a quiet but confident young man, has told The Advocate this morning that he’s ‘gonna get a good look’ at the bouncers.

After the default night school night classes at the historic college are full of politics and nerd culture, a group of college pool players hang around the Polytechnic Ladies section.

“I know it’s pretty fucked up that the last thing you want to do is get into a private school class with four or five rowdy hippies,” he said.

“But in all honesty, after I finish my degree, I’ll just take the school bus back to Cowra. But yeah, I’ve just got a feeling that this place is going to be pretty wild,”

“You know, just like last time I went to The Polytechnic. I really didn’t want to leave the Polytechnic but I had to take a job at the Polytechnic. It’s pretty fucked up out there.”

But while he’s enjoying a place where he can stand up close to the bar and listen to some of the country’s most talented bassists play, he doesn’t want to face the problems he has after finishing school.

Speaking candidly to The Advocate this morning, Peter said he can’t deal with the fees anymore that he’s just graduated from university, and he needs to ‘get my head around the country.’

“I had a chance to go and see the Rock, Paper, Scissors festival last year and I just had to see the Polytechnic all,” he said.

“So I went to The Polytechnic again last night for my personal viewing,”

Greens Leader Richard Di Natale Calls For Royal Commission Into How To Run A Country Town

TEXT:

The Australian Greens Party have released a statement this afternoon, asking the nation to come together and decide whether their actions have contributed to the declining standards of the Australian way of life.

It is believed the more scandals arise within the Australian political system, the more likely it is that the Greens Party will come to the surface.

The statement read:

“After last week’s revelations regarding the Royal Commission into the Banking and Financial Sector, we can’t believe how blatantly biased and sadistic our government is”

“Perhaps, we’d be able to help put a proper end to the Abbott Government”

“Maybe, we’d be able to at least get people to stop trying to pull strings”

“But at the moment, yes. We want to feel like we’ve got something to say about these matters”

“Hopefully, we’ll get some of these very uncomfortable situations in the headlines that we haven’t been able to mention before”

“The only way we’d be able to be more inclusive than the Federal Government is if we started paying people actually to speak on these issues in our local areas”

“Otherwise, we’ll always be left behind”

“Ah,” he sighed.

“It’s pretty clear we need a bit more ball. I could literally get a full-time household staff person for the last few years”

“Seriously. This country is disappearing so fast”

A leading New South Wales religious school chaplain is in hot water this week after it was revealed that he’s only been doing it for a couple of weeks.

The school chaplain at the Betoota Grove Royal Christian School, in Sydney’s central west, is being threatened with suspension from his position if he doesn’t stop shitting on the footy pitch.

One teacher has described the school’s football pitch as ‘a bit dirty’ and ‘a bit wet’.

“It’s good that he’s tried to keep the pitch a bit wet,” said one teacher.

“But as soon as you’re in the middle of a hard-fought match, it’s hard to keep your shit clean.”

The Advocate reached out to the Royal Christian College for comment but have yet to receive a reply – but are hopeful that the school will come to the chaplain’s defence once the results of the season get in.

Gold Coast Man Surprised At How Little This Year’s Christmas Market Has Gone

TEXT:

A senior Gold Coast man says he was a bit surprised at how little the local market has gone this year.

Betoota Grove property investor, Nick Collison (65) says that while the market has gone up a bit this year, it’s still not as much as last year.

“I mean, the watermelon crop has been good for a number of years now, but that’s really all you can talk about at Christmas. Nothing really happens here anymore”

Collison says he isn’t even sure if the locals have really missed the ball this year.

“We’ve only got four days until Christmas, but I bet they thought it would be a good time to close down for the summer. We might be able to get a few events going in the next few days, but it’s not like I’m giving up on the Gold Coast yet. I’m getting a good run going for this year”

The commercial fisherman says the last time he went down to the Gold Coast to survey the local property market was back in 2005, when he was getting the boot.

“I got the mail off the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) website telling me that the market was heading down… at that time it was down really. It took me by surprise a bit, so I went down there to survey the market, but nothing came up,”

“I hope this year’s Christmas market has gone by without a bang. We might have had the greatest year on record, and a bit of a bust last year”

Collison says even the Gold Coast could use a boost this year if things don’t take a turn for the worse.

“Yeah. It’s one of the reasons I’ve given up on the Gold Coast. My house is totally fucked up… I can’t even afford to pay the diesel and phone bill of a 60-year-old mother-of-three”

“The only way out of this is for them to get the capital markets in again to put some capital in. In my day it’s hard to make the rent, I’ve got to at least pretend. But yeah, back to the Gold Coast again. You can’t save your money and you can’t pay it back. It’s either be tax or a credit card debt. If you don’t like it on the Gold Coast then go down there and find a better job that pays you less than what you’re being paid in”

Man Who Bought A Mercedes Benz For One-Night-Only Experience

A Betoota Grove man who was travelling to South America with his parents this week bought a brand new Mercedes Benz for the only occasion he’d ever be allowed to drive it.

John Peter Coolidge, a 24-year-old who doesn’t speak much, and whose parents speak only gibberish because his language skills are so far out of level, was travelling to Miami on Wednesday night with his father to attend an exclusive samba dance camp in the city’s trendy CBD district that also he’s attending on his own dime, as an individual citizen.

However, for the first time in his life, John bought his new Benz just for the trip.

The Advocate reached out to John’s father, who asked to remain somewhat anonymous, for comment and received but unqualified reply.

As it turns out, John was just returning home from the dance camp after a night out in his hometown, with his dad, a 24-hour shop and the guys.

In the above video, John’s dad is seen buying the car with his funds.

But as he starts to open the trunk, he realises that there’s only so much cash he has in it.

“How bout a night in Paris for the weekend, ya Wessie?” he asks.

“A Benz Benz is only $40 000 so you can save that for a trip to Brazil later on.”

“At least that’s what I was thinking.”

As the video ends, John has made it clear that he’s not just leaving for Europe on a whim.

“That’s what he’s doing, ya dirty wuss.”

Q&A: Jay-Z Drops A Thud At MAFS And Starts Making Racist Comments

TEXT:

IT WAS THE DAY OF A KAPA of bushwalking, a place held dear in the state capitals of Australia, by hundreds of thousands of jet-setting young professionals who needed to scratch their heads in the snow for the past six days.

Jay-Z stepped out of his cage at the MAFS Late Late Late Show on Monday night, reminding everyone on the show that he was an Australian.

Now sitting in his backyard, the rapper continues to remind everyone that he is an Australian.

“So, Australia. So proud” he begins.

“Aussie pride. Took a look at the place”

Jay-Z’s conservationist heritage goes without saying. It’s well known that he is a big supporter of Australia Day, and believes that his political views on it should be an issue.

“I have never thought about racism until I met this woman, and I’m always going to reserve my right to be racist, no matter how controversial it may be, because I care about this country” he said.

“Oi don’t get me started”

“I hate white people, but, they are the only people that get me”

“But fuck em”

He then states that a better society would embrace the diversity of people – but that country isn’t a better society.

“As for Australia Day. Fuck it, that’s a colonial relic. Australia Day was for colonisers and tyrants. It was for white people who needed to make a crust”

It is at this point that Jay-Z begins making reference to his white mum, Barry, from a long line of Aboriginal Tasmanians.

“And I’m going to prove it to you”

Weird Mob Of Late 1990s Tones Go On About Their Booze

WHEN HE STARTED working at the local Aperol Spritz, he wasn’t just getting paid. He was getting well.

Cameron Simons, a teenager at the time, says he actually got paid $400 a week before tax. That was before he started working at the trendy local chain, too.

“Yeah, a lot of that money I’m getting from the pubs is coming from the money I’m getting from the surfboards,” he said.

“That and the waves I’m surfing on. As for the surfboards, yeah they’re a bit big on the inside. Not as big as some of the big ones out there. Not as big as the Jack Daniels ones, either. Not bad,”

“I guess I’ve got the inside scoop on what the old school fuckboys around the country have been up to. They’re looking for a cash deposit to their late model Ducati Countach or something. No clue. They’re out for the sunset to be their sweet table.”

With thousands of dollars of clothing still on the ground, the prospect of being a rich boy now has a look to it, too.

But unlike the men of the 1990s, who had their suits up as the times went by and were looking for gold stud earrings in the bargain bin section, the present generation have a different type of problems.

“I mean, yes, I got my suit from somewhere around town in the early 2000s,” he said.

“However, I’ve taken it off a couple of times and I’ve got it on as flat as possible. It’s still got all the good things from when I was starting out, but I’ve been going to the local Aperol Spritz all summer so I guess I’m getting the work done,”

“My old man asked me if I wanted to buy his hand-me-downs from the wine shop down the street, so I guess I’ve taken that as a no and bought the best suits I’ve got. Not even the $500 or so they’d charge for them. A good range, too. It’s nice to have the means to live like a king now.”

Church-Funded Study Reveals Kids Of Migrants Think Being White Is Morally OK

TEXT:

A recent Church-funded study has found that the kids of migrants are far more likely to be tempted to go to hell than those of natives.

Australia’s peak scientific body, the CSIRO, released their findings this morning on the nation’s borders as the nation deals with an acute crisis on the nation’s streets.

In a report commissioned by the CSIRO, the children of migrants were found to be far more likely to have an attitude towards an ethic that many citizens of Australia consider to be morally acceptable.

The findings suggest that migrants aren’t just trying to create a better place for themselves, but to start paying some sort of tax and have their way with society as well.

One of the government’s findings found that migrants were also able to start paying more tax, leading to fewer services, such as the power to call the country’s environmental agencies are under and the ability to dissolve the Senate’s senate.

However, the Church-funding CSIRO found that many of these kids just want to play with machines, or be white.

One of the problems the Turnbull government has with migrant’s is that they don’t seem to have found a solution to the inner city’s housing crisis that has lead to tens of thousands of single-family homes being sold and developed in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth over the last decade.

Some of the children found ways to come to Australia from war-ravaged nations are forced to work in areas that have had little to no war for the last few centuries – such as of course Australia.

For example, the main issue for many is the fact that their policies have done nothing to prevent climate change.

In a report commissioned by the CSIRO found that the generation born on a boat with no family links, and no previous experience of doing battle with armies and countries that think they are superior, would be more likely to immediately spend years inside prison than the native population.

Minister For Education And Training Inveighs Blatantly Against Charter Schools

TEXT:

The Minister For Education and Training inveighs against the rise of charter schools, telling the Betoota Advocate that a significant number of his party are in favour of closing them down.

Inveighing against the issue has got him in trouble with his own party, who he says are very much ‘in favour’ of the idea of putting independent schools first.

The future of the currently failing independent schools is of particular concern to the minister, who says there’s a danger that one of these ‘pedo bastards’ may have been wrongly baptised into a cult of personality.

“The real issue here is how do you justify all the money that these little kids are going to be paying to their god?” said the minister to our reporters, while cradling his 11-year-old grandson.

“How do you justify all the money that these little kids are going to be paying to their god?”

“And how do you justify their god to people who aren’t really listening to your god?”

“No wonder no one really gives a fuck about the fuckin’ thing we’re doing.”

However, a number of the party’s elders are hoping that the rampant tax cheating and flagrant disregard for the public will see them forced to resign from politics at the next federal election – which would put the government back in power.

While the minister was unable to address the possibility of a possible double dissolution election, The Advocate understands that he’s not expecting too many problems when he returns to the top job, especially after this rise in far-right factions within the Coalition.

Clive Palmer to remain in the NSW prison for a further year after sentencing

TEXT:

DARK SOULS Behind Bars: Former NSW Premier, Clive Palmer, has vowed to remain in the state’s gallows until his legal team can find some way to clear him from his international arrest warrant.

The sinner’s criminal convictions come after a trial in the United States where he was accused of numerous crimes including fraud and racketeering. He was also sentenced to ten years in prison for the murder of a UN worker, the kidnapping and dismembered dismemberment of an innocent Cattleman’s son and attempted murder of a Federal Labor Party staffer.

The New Zealand-born politician was released from prison early on bail after serving out a ten-year sentence for a total of eleven charges, including racketeering, fraud, treason, immigration, and numerous assault charges.

As the Queensland Government continue their close ties to the former political prisoner, The Advocate can exclusively reveal that he was granted freedom on bail to face the extradition hearing in America.

The former Premier of the Australian State of Origin, Cronulla, was convicted of a string of serious crimes including rape, murder and attempted rape.

“It’s fucking crass and the only thing that gets me through it all is the fact that Cronulla is the city of light rail,” said Mr Palmer.

“But it’s a tiny little shithole town, it’s not like every bloke in it knows how to use a lighter, let alone use a firearm,”

“The last time I was in, I was in the face of one of the biggest scandals in NSW history. It really is a beautiful thing. So we’ve lined up a few of our finest historians from the University of Southern Queensland to look over some of the accusations that Clive Palmer has been made out to have committed over the last 30 years,”

“But I’ll be back in my round one day. Not just any old day, it’s the day I make this town pay.”

It is believed that Mr Palmer and his family will be arriving in the NSW capital this afternoon. It is believed that he plans to christen the park that the NCPS has been using for their private car parks.

A local woman has had to repeatedly ask her friend if she’s done dinner this afternoon, as the usual chocolate afternoon tea failed to curb her aversions over her lack of eating.

Ashley Crippler (30) says she had to ask her friend Brittany Carbone (20) if she had dinner.

“I’m making chocolate tea,” said the work environment specialist.

“You know, you gotta eat and the chocolate tea doesn’t make any sense.”

“It’s full of sugar and all that good shit, it is. I’ve got the perfect recipe so you’d need a half-decent blender to make it really on point,”

“You’ve gotta eat the chocolate and then have someone else whip up the real food for you. Not the cheap food I know and love, that’s the real thing.”

The Advocate reached out to Brittany for comment but she was already halfway through our interview when she answered with the other part of the house.

“Oi, dont get me wrong, i’m not poor. It’s not like I’m trying to be poor, it’s just that, there’s a lot of things you have to do at home,”

“I have this really nice scotch and i’m nice to everybody. I know what you mean, it’s not a special thing.”

When asked to clarify that she’s not in the business of taking the handmaids into the top house, Brittany said that sometimes you have to have a bit of a hard, salty coke.

“Don’t knock it, man, just don’t,”

“I’ve got some of the best chips on the planet right here in front of me.”

Hip Hop Artist Who Released New Song Suggests An Emergence Of ‘Uniqueness’

TEXT:

A South Bank rapper with three albums on his fingers has today suggested that his fanbase have gone soft, and that his music will always be different, no matter what garbage is put on the radio, and no matter what distopian sociological theory is behind it.

Johnny Marr, aka Johnny Marr, who was responsible for the infamous ‘Oooo Marr! Oooo Marr!’ piano number, has today decided to take a shot at everyone, and their bullshit hip hop, in a press conference held in front of a half-built gym where his pro-gun supporters are holding press conferences with their usual suspects.

“I'm just a nice guy, and I love my fans. I just think hip hop needs to be about helping people become better, like I know a few guys in the industry that love killing zombified people and stuff, but I love my fans and I have a right to say that in my professional capacity as a hip hop artist,” he said.

The Advocate reached out to the rap-news organisation, Infernet, for comment, but they weren’t willing to go on the record and say the group chat has turned toxic since Marr was announced as the official hip hop artist of the day, which is about as open a mouth as you can get.

Strawberry Grower Not Even Sure Why People Feel So Worried About His Future

TEXT:

A Betoota Grove strawberry grower said he’s spent nearly two years feeling sheepish, but now that the weather is starting to turn he’s starting to wonder if things will get better before he’s even got around to it.

Valtrex Strawberry Grower, Tame Impala Grower and owner of Perennial Fruit, Mo Yeung, has told The Advocate that his near-death experience last year while growing grapes in a shady backyard shed, and subsequent inability to get rid of them, is one of the reasons he’s spent the last six months feeling so uneasy about his future.

“It just kind of happened, you know,” he said.

“I’m starting to get worried about my future. I’m not sure what my future holds, but I’ve been getting these same seeds almost non-stop,”

“Every time I had a litter of grapes in a shed in Betoota Grove, I’d just take a drag and hit the co-worker with a shovel, telling him that I’m sick of having to do that every time.”

Mr Yeung also told us that he believes the vegetables that were in a shed, and on the ground, were all dead.

He asked that we do our very best to contact The Advocate, and that we visit their office each morning at 9 am.

“I don’t think the office people are particularly excited for this year,” he said.

“As I said, I’ve been playing it very safe, and to the credit of the lollies, we’ve been able to farm almost all the produce this year,”

“But I guess that’s putting the cart before the horse. I’m not sure why the seed room, or what the purpose of it is. It’s fun. Anyway, I’ve got to go now. Bye bye.”

The Advocate reached out to a number of Betoota Grove’s top-notch strawberry growers for comment, but all declined to comment on this article.

Melbourne socialites spearhead push for a casino at Melbournemouth pier

TEXT:

The last bastion of Australian traditional values and liberal values have been the people of Victoria, they haven’t changed, and it is the people of Melbourne that they have been trying to reach out to, with their proposed casino on the Melbournemouth pier.

The group believe it would be a good thing for the traditional Australians, that is, those who don’t want to go to war, and those who enjoy watching American sports teams win championships, to have a place to have a proper barbeque on top of the most amazing part of the riverina.

The Melbournemouth is the most popular public place in the harbour capital, and the site has been the scene of many spirited barbeques over the years.

A recent survey of Victorian-based restaurant and bar-hopping enthusiasts has revealed that many of them don’t really enjoy the traditional Victorian hospitality.

One barbeque enthusiast from Betoota’s Old Dock said the Melbournemouth has always been the site of a fierce debate, especially during the construction of the rail spur that will run along the outer end of the open cut of the river.

“You’ve got a lot of old school traditional Aussies and Austrians throwing their hats in the ring for this casino,” said the barbeque enthusiast, who asked to remain anonymous.

“You’ve got the Zetas, the Tourists, the Mastiffs… you name it, there’s a lot of people who like it.”

New Study Finds Cronut Is Only Making Life Hard If You’re Fucking Me

TEXT:

A recent study conducted by The Australian Human Rights Commission has found that snorting ‘tins’ is only making life harder for sick young people, if they even know their face.

The study concluded that the only way to make life harder for a young person who is fucking a cron.

It has been established that as many young people go through life, as they do become accustomed to it – they inevitably find ways to cut their own internal rectums.

While this may seem trivial at first, the research into the generation of 2016 has shown that young people are becoming more insistent on cutting their own internal rectums, regardless of how fucked they are, or even how messed they are themselves.

“What we have found is that young people who are sick and full of shit are the only people who make life hard for the sick and uneducated” said the commission’s human rights commissioner, Pauline Hanson.

“And they need to know that these kids aren’t asking for anything, they are actually demanding it”

“If I didn’t make life hard for these kids, they would’ve had no way of finding out that the only way to get justice for yourself is to join a gang”

“As the only people who know how to pull teeth, and can run fast and tight,” she said before making a cactus-studded fist.

Tax-payer-Purchased Jetsons Bring Back Snowglobes For Christmas

TEXT:

With January only a matter of days away, iconic tax-payer-purchased Jetsons were able to stockpile enough stock in their BMWs to make it to their destination with great cheer, as the nation’s predominantly poor and working class concluded their very own month of holidays.

However, as is the case with most taxpayer-funded vehicles, the rich and multi-millionaire owners are able to enjoy a period of freedom and luxury with their jets.

This time, it’s the richer ones that enjoy the luxury of burning through their annual tax dollars to decorate the lot.

Our reporter reached out to the owner of a Jetson worth up to $60,000, who’s decided to remain anonymous, in that the owner is ‘sick and tired’ of these things costing him money.

“I love a jet,” explained the owner.

“Not all of them make it up like I think they do. Some are not even from here. A few years back, I bought a Jet 2 for a work car, which was in the top of a pack. The year before, I bought a Mini Cooper which was a bargain.”

“But I got the Jet after the Christmas break,” he said.

“So I spent my money at least until I went to see the Jets for the season and it’s worked out well. The boys know how much of a jet I am, so I haven’t had to make a big sacrifice of luxury or anything. I’ve even made the decision not to go to a full-time job so I can enjoy all the Jets-related perks,”

“However, I’m not too happy about it.”

The Advocate reached out to the Jetsons for comment and received a prompt reply.

Jets owner Mike Medavoy interviewed with The Advocate in March and was understandably livid when our reporter asked if his Jetson was a ‘jet.’

He explained that the Jetson he bought has no rotational capacity and that his owner’s son bought a ‘jet’ for him because he’s ‘a nice guy.’

“The son has a Mini Cooper, a four-wheel-drive-rally-kit, a Lamborghini Countachina and a $25,000 Sancerreret for his birthday,” explained Mike.

“I’m not a rich man, and I don’t mind dirty cars and jet skis but I’m not fucking Jet,”

“It’s hard to live with these things on the end of the spectrum.”

Katter AO Of Australian Marriage Affiliation Amazes Nation With His Ability To Recall Who He’s Gotten On With

(a)

– Katter Australia Party leader, Mark Craig, has today said the position has changed and that he’s going to get on with his pre-existing voting bloc – which he describes as ‘bludgers’ – despite the fact that he is the only current Australian who still refuses to back marriage equality.

Mr Craig, the author of the much-trumpeted ‘Kill All C’nt Crackers’ – has today reassured his political allies that he is, in fact, a ‘hard-working man who was raised with a strong sense of personal identity and pride’.

– It was at this point that the mainstream Australian left collectively groaned,”

“He knows more about Australian marriage than we do!” screamed a shocked local union official, who was still going through the motions of casting her ballots from the queue while she noticed her colleagues were looking at their phones.

“This is the day they tell us what to do with our members – so we become worse,”

“He’s a bludger, and that’s just the most obvious sign that he’s a wanker!”

The union official, Jane Dixon, also spoke to The Advocate at a local business lunch where she explained that the current federal Labor leader, Bill Shorten, has given her very best wishes to Labor.

“Bill Shorten has got the big job now. He is a true blue Sydney boy and deserves to be in a leadership position in the party,” she said.

“Bill has the right background and pedigree, you know?”

“I hate him. I hate Bill and everything he stands for. I don’t even agree with a lot of his policies. But he has the shit-kicking to be in the top job in this country.”

The Advocate reached out to the Federal Labor office for comment but they’d just moved the media scrum outside the press conference so we’d have no way of knowing what they had to say.

Nation-Wide Controversy Over An Outer Sunset View Of Outer Sunset

TEXT:

A recent survey of young people around the country has found that a growing number of young people are questioning the reality of time and the nature of the universe, and a significant number are questioning whether time even exists.

Although the concept of time was once believed to be absolute, in recent years a growing number of people have questioned whether the concept of space or time exists at all.

The Prime Minister’s Office have confirmed that the survey results are not indicative of general dissatisfaction with the way things are presented to us by the Australian pop culture establishment.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison has said that many young people are “deeply troubled” by the idea that the way things are presented to them isn’t consistent with the way things actually are.

“I know people are saying that they don’t understand why you don’t see something but to them, it doesn’t really add up,” Morrison said.

“You can’t understand the world they live in if you don’t believe in time. It never happened, it never will happen, and I don’t believe in the world you live in if you don’t believe in the bible.”

Morrison has been in a close relationship with the biblical literalists, so it is not surprising that he is a big supporter of a view that time doesn’t exist and that God doesn’t exist.

However, many of the young people surveyed were concerned about being the second generation of Australians who didn’t believe in God and were critical of the way things are presented to them.

Man Who Won’t Buy A Can Of Coke Says Foreign Aid Is Appropriate

TEXT:

A north Betoota man who has a fear of foreign aid is wrong.

Wanda Dork-Frog, who lives with her husband in a six-bedroom Betoota Heights detached house, has been on the wrong side of most news stories regarding Australia’s ongoing recession.

She’s blamed all these issues on our nation’s foreign aid recipients, saying that they are selfish, out-of-touch and welfare recipients, who she doesn’t understand.

“It’s so easy for these out-of-touch and welfare recipients to be out of touch with themselves and the nation,” said the 55-year-old.

“But this is the hard part. We need help. We need help with the housing bubble. We need help with the financial system. We need help with the immigration system,”

“There is so much I’m not able to deal with the welfare recipients or the migrants or the food hand-outs. I’m exhausted. I’m in need of a life change.”

But it’s not just the way Wanda thinks, it’s the way the nation’s media thinks, that’s according to the people listening to this interview.

In fact, our reporter’s sources indicate that a large percentage of Australian’s hate going out to their local bush or moat, or the bushpeople who live there, and that a large number of Australians also dislike foreign aid.

“What does Theosophos have to do with anything? There’s no way he can get up there and help us if he knows what he’s doing,” he said.

Voting in his hair was one of the most controversial points of a 30-year-old, and quite frankly quite boring, career as a professional astrologer.

Speaking today via a remote telephone call in remote southeastern Queensland, Barnaby Joyce says the news that the Government has finally decided on their climate policy is ‘good news for the environment’.

“It’s good news for the environment, because the massive polluters and polluting industry have got it in their hands, so they can begin, for the first time in my professional life, to transport their polluting machinery from to to and from their prized hold pit,”

“And for the people who don’t like that, it’s not bad news for them either”

Philadeph Hike After First August In Australia In Years Attended By A NSW Premier Announced

TEXT:

The state of New South Wales is not having a good day, with both premier Gladys Berejiklian and her party getting mired in a number of scandals involving both politics and the way she governs.

These scandals have seen her team put under intense pressure to control the flow of money through the state, and to also get under their belt with a few serious scandals that really have seen an amount of dirty laundry out in the open.

For the first time in a long time, New South Wales and Queensland are having a hard time keeping the lid on a number of these scandals.

It has been confirmed by both the Northern Beaches and the city of Brisbane that the entire state is absolutely gunning for the Liberal-National.

While the middle classes and upper class have their breath taken away by the scandals that have seen a number of state politicians go down for the count in a display of absolute corruption, the wealthy and the very top class and the country strollers have their breath made harder by the scandals that have seen the NSW Premier and the NSW party leader give a few big mouth platitudes.

During the last election campaign, the two state premiers were under intense fire for various scandals, particularly the ones that have seen her party using their power to create unrealistic expectations of things like wages and pensions for the public servants, and to publicise some shocking stories from an alleged drug-dealing lifestyle.

While Premier Gladys Berejiklian has been forced to make some tough calls regarding her political opponents, she has also had to worry about her own personal finances, as well as an ongoing shunning scandal that saw her travel millions in international travel while she was in office.

After a 3 year investigation, The Daily Telegraph can exclusively reveal that the NSW Liberal Party is now on a collision course with the electorate, as the party begins to lose momentum.

The state premiers are both facing mounting pressure to sack under fire and and in some cases, criminally, for not doing more than just asking Sydney mayor Clover Moore to ask them to scrap the cap on number of venue opening hours and wages, but also the gutting of the current toll booth for local towns and the removal of beaches.

However, in a national movement towards less public transport and beaches, the NSW Liberal Party is said to be reeling.

One local NSW Labor member, Tim Storrier (48) says it’s a ‘perfect example of how this country is sick of being made to feel that they aren’t as important as rich people who also live in Sydney.

“The Liberal Party is basically just the NSW state government today” says Tim.

“The fact that they both used to be so relevant in the global city, and so much fun with their nicknames, is gone”

“I mean, they’re both a good thing for the nation. But they are also the exact reason why we lost the last election. Which is also a good thing, and I’m going to get the third one, too”

“You’ve got massive influx of young people coming in here with their parents, and everyone on the NSW Liberal Team seem to think that’s the most positive thing for the country”

Tim says as a member of the NSW Liberal Party, it’s his duty to be one of the real state and national leaders, and argue for the survival of NSW Liberal Party in Australia.

“It’s my duty to make sure there isn’t another ALP or BNP coup attempt against my boss, or my boss’s boss. It’s not that hard”

“Don’t want to be a bit of a problem”

Professor Discovers Evolution Is Just A Big Envy Scheme

TEXT:

The evolution of life on Earth is a mystery that scientists have spent decades trying to solve. While some evolutionary scientists believe that life could evolve by natural selection, many others believe that it is due to environmental and societal factors.

The evolution of life is seen as a pivotal issue in the development of modern life as scientists and their funding agencies insist that it is the best guess what the direction of life is going in.

Another controversial theory is that life arose from chaos and the unchecked uncontrolled growth of populations, eventually leading to the anthropogenic environmental catastrophe known as the Great Dying.

According to this theory, it is possible that evolution could have created a niche for itself in the environment by creating a population that has been bred by a God-like being who is superior to them in every way and giving them everything they need to survive and reproduce.

“It’s really hard to believe that a religion came down to us,” said one researcher. “I mean, I’ve got these theories about it but, the short story is that I don’t really care that much. The Bible says a lot about climate change, but I don’t think we’ve got a science of the earth where I can confidently say, ‘We will rule over you, I will give you everything you want and you can eat in peace.’”

Another young researcher, William Huxley, says he is too busy to keep reading more than one scientific paper at a time.

“I am more interested in politics, science and a general giddiness about the world,” he said.

“When I’m not writing these things I’ll be enjoying being a gardener or something.”

Local Goat-Shooter Desecrates His Own Black Out Before Walking Back To Bed

Browsed through the New York Times this morning, I noticed the article on the front page called ‘The Goat Shootings: What We Know So Far’ which was filled with new information.

The article told of the news of the goat shootings being “massacre” and stated that the “tragic shootings” were happening across the country.

Student Praises Northern Beaches District Community For Being In The Know About So-Called ‘Booming’

TEXT:

A 22-year-old man from the city’s fabled Northern Beaches district has today complimented the booming community for their hard work with social media and the city council.

Isobel Faolala, a recent graduate of a prominent wave town preparatory school, says he’s been trying to drum up a little bit of excitement for the upcoming generation of young people – but it’s been a tough slog.

The Australian-born footballer says the Sydney Roosters is just the best way to pass time and unwind.

“So what I’m trying to say is, while these Boomers are struggling to keep up with the Jones and Beattie kids – there’s also a flourishing community of so-called ‘boomers’ who just adore rugby league and cricket”

“You should see the Sydney Roosters – they are so much fun to watch”

“It’s a bit like the New York Giants – their fanbase is so global,” says the young man.

The name is derived from the fact that NRL clubs are based in the South-East coastline of the Northern Beaches, which sits about 830km south of Betoota, and just 1,330km north of the NSW South Coast.

Booming towns like the Blue Mountains (Willow), The Gold Coast (Cato), The Gold Coast Plain (Parramatta) and more recently the Napier Coast (North-West) are the three big inland centres of the NSW Southern Beaches.

The area is made up of about 55,000 square kilometres, and about an additional 46,500 square kilometres of the Sydney basin.

The southern tip is just the area of the NSW Central Coast, and is just a little bit larger than the area of Sydney.

• Townsville High To Gradually End Depressing Rhythm Of Tired Black Male Stock Music

TEXT:

From the Gold Coast to the Atiqua to the Campbell River, Black Males have been the subject of a steady drumbeat of music over the last couple of years.

Not the bad times, but the bad vibes.

Today is different.

As much as it pains me to say, I can’t understand how it’s taken this long for these degenerate degenerate degenerate scum to start making music.

Last week, I was sitting on a couch with a bunch of my college music friends listening to Coachella, the biggest draw card of them all, as it turns out.

“I don’t know what it is” said one of the young men, Kyle, in a husky, booming voice.

Kyle knew very well what it was.

Kyle, as a young man, was a fan of the work of The Smiths.

His friend Conor, who also happened to be a young man at the same time, heard that Coachella was playing in the background while the table was being played.

“So I joined them and we all sat down, Conor down the front, Kyle down the front, Kyle up the front,” Conor began.

“It’s so vibrant, I think the vibe is very good,” said Kyle.

“I hear a lot of them say that they’ve never heard these kinds of music before, and they keep coming back over and over.”

“I don’t blame them. It’s a strange vibe, I guess.”

Kyle knew that if this vibe is what The Smiths wanted, they’d have to leave the floor of the Carrabba to a new generation, which he’d start playing along to every time he heard it.

“I don’t blame them,” he said.

“I thought about it, I can’t believe we kept playing it for 20 years, I must’ve missed it. I had a good run, we did great things,”

“Let’s see how long this lasts. I’m just lucky we didn’t have to do it for the rest of our days,” said Kyle.

The idea, which is still alive in his head, was passed onto his friend Colin, who’s actually starting to think about doing it too.

“That’s what I thought, too. I’d miss them more than a second, a month or so. Still, at least I’m getting a bit of music to play anyway,” he said.

“So why play it?”

Our reporter agreed with Colin then said he had to get off the couch.

Uncle Tony X: ‘You’re Not Doing Anyone Real Justice By Soliciting Your Opinion In These Steganographic Papers’

TEXT:

Former Prime Minister Uncle Tony X has taken to social media today to suggest that the Australian public deserves better than to be treated as a third-class citizen by those who seek to harm it through the social media and political elite.

Tony X is a notorious figure in the Australian community who is very much known for his ability to transform into the next Ziggy Stardust. However, the legacy of his political career is much more than that.

The longtime Aussie rock/rock-enthusiast, who was one of the loudest proponents for a return to the Anzels in the early 1990s, is also a world-renowned authority on indigenous issues.

The former community elder and Liberal Party member took time out of his busy afternoon of sounding a million guns to speak to the Betoota Advocate today.

“I guess I am one of the last of a dying breed,” he laughed.

“To be frank with you, I’ve always considered myself to be one of the real snakes in the earth,”

“I reckon the problem with us Aboriginal people is that we are being taken from our rightful lands, on a massive multinational scam. The mining lobby, the mining companies, the federal mining minister. The truth is I don’t even know who these people are. The fact that they are all running the country, is the fact.”

This follows revelations by the ABC this week that the Australian Government is trying to receive millions of dollars in cash from overseas mining companies to help them infiltrate the Australian judicial system. 

The documents were obtained under the Access to Information Act.

Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and his close friend Uncle Tony X have refused to condemn the actions of these foreign donors, with him saying they need to look at the system before making decisions about the justice system.

“I mean, seriously. Why would you need a government lawyer if your vote isn’t important,” said Turnbull.

“You’ve got people like David Leyonhjelm and the really bad blokes from the ministry of an independent nation telling us how to run the country, and they aren’t paying for the services they are supposed to provide.”

Former PM John Howard Reportedly Not Quite Ready To Face Loss Of Kooriassen One-Tiered

TEXT:

The coming election of a One-Tiered Prime Minister will see the nation’s future ruled by the greatest Liberal MP’s to ever sit on the nation’s top job, John Howard, become a lot less clear.

With his age and gumption, the former PM has good reason to be wary of the One-Tiered system, and much more reason to think it’s broken in the first place.

In this particular case, a One-Tiered Prime Minister, who’s announced his intention to spend the next four years trying to end, stop or reverse a wide range of environmental changes that have been in the pipeline for decades, has only won one election, but won almost all of the votes he had, after the Australian Liberal Party has been given free reign to spend millions of taxpayer dollars campaigning against any form of change to the Australian political system.

Most of the voters in Kooriassen, in the nation’s most rural seat, didn’t know that John Howard has been able to successfully con the public on so many key policies that he once could.

That is, unless they were elderly and poor. In that case, John Howard might have reason to be nervous about this guy, given his track record of environmental vandalism, climate change denial, and the wholesale disenfranchisement of the lowest common denominator in our nation’s electorate.

The obvious concern, therefore, is that John Howard might have reason to fear a one-horse loss in the upcoming election. It’s very likely that he’s going to be the first to acknowledge that climate change is real and that there’s a significant danger of our planet being uninhabitable.

It is very difficult to see what this campaign will achieve, except for the number of New South Boomer voters that are likely to be voting Liberal in the next election, if they don’t become a committed, automatic government in the mid-term.

Thousands of young women in Australia are currently single, with few signs of marriage ahead

TEXT:

IN A NURSELY PROSPECT, nearly one hundred young women have today been blessed with a lifetime of single-minded devotion to their chosen field of study.

As a result, they have an earful of the school of life in Australia.

The majority of these single women are the descendants of the single mothers, but others are in fact pursuing the same type of study as the last generation of Australian women – not just the school, but also the job that they’ve got lined up in their future.

While the general population do not appear to have been what most Australian academics would describe as single, in the Australian college degree as well as the ‘slight’, those ladies with a mouth-watering patience to engage the world on the issues that Australians care about.

This time, they are young. They are virgins.

The Advocate is taking a rare opportunity to hail from the same geographical area as these young women, as well as three of their friends.

The Advocate understands this is a rare opportunity, where we will have the privilege to interview these virgins.

The first being Sarah, who has been single since high school.

“I just couldn’t look past that plump schooner the Vodka cooler man pulled from the bottle shop up at the Racecourse. I mean, it’s getting in the way of a pair of gym shoes anyway.”

Sarah said that she decided to go to uni at Univerist because it’s the only thing available in Australia that’s ‘mainstream’ – meaning it’s the only thing on offer that is relevant to Australians of all ages.

“I guess I’m just lucky I found uni in Australia. All these horny old white boomers from Sydney and Melbourne don’t get a kick out of it.”

“I just got married this year.”

“My husband and I are considering trying get a blue collar job as a result of that. It’s just really hard to look at this urban professional lifestyle that I’m choosing.”

The Advocate reached out to the Vodka cooler man for comment, but have yet to receive a reply.

“Let Me See Your Ego”: An Entirely Nonpolitical-Actual Writer Threatens To Shoot The Shit Out Of This 1st-Hand Writer

TEXT:

One Nation leader and lifelong reader of Dave Eggers, has made a public threat to the life of a very unpopular writer.

This comes as David E. Jones demands the resignation of his local editor, who was recently discovered to be an unpaid student at the local creative writing course.

“I’m not taking this lying down, I’m going to kill somebody. I’m going to shoot this writer in the back, where it’s safe. Then I’ll make a public statement that tells everybody here that I’m not a racist and that you should be careful.”

The letter was accompanied by a set of chilling cinemagraphs that proved that even Mr Jones was no longer part of the circle, threatening to shoot the last person with a submachine gun in the writers’ section of the pub.

Local bloke, Dave, says he’s never read Dave Eggers but this letter is really telling him to get out of Dave’s way.

“I’m getting sick of the way this stuff is coming out. Even the way he talks about minorities, it’s totally hostile towards them. And there’s this whole section about race, which I find to be pretty gross. The whole idea of race is a construct of the left wing and their media mouthpieces,”

“How dare they even mention that section, that’s the whole fucking point,”

“I’m going to murder this writer and then set this novelist on fire in the writers’ section again because I’m fucking sick of all this shit,”

“This fucking thing took about an hour, and I’m really glad I got my breath back.”

Our reporter reached out to Dave Eggers for comment, but he said he’d be back in touch with everyone if he has a minute.

Australia – Are You Ready To Spend A Week Without A State Government Plan?

TEXT:

While it is true that almost no one in the country actually spends a week without a State Government plan, the fact that the majority of the nation has not is that most people don’t care.

For those who actually do want to spend a week without state government funded services, it is worth mentioning that a lot of states have put on some good one-off to make sure their electorates are informed and excited about being without a pay up.

These laws and plans are often seen as people start to tear apart their current plans and a government that is slow to respond.

In this article, we are going to look at some of the major policy changes that have come out in the last 12 months.

Victoria

In 2012, Victorian people were promised that they would be able to have their own plans and they would have a plan, with legislation coming on in the next year or so.

The promise was later broken when, after less than a year, almost everybody in the state, except for the inner city and a few suburbs and small towns, had a plan.

It was believed that people living in the shire, as well as the disaffected suburban elite would be helped to have their own plans.

Local transgression can be diagnosed by one visit to a local doctor. The most senior of these doctors will prescribe a course of general anaesthesia and sedation. It’s not that he won’t like you as a human being, it’s just that most doctors don’t have the heart to prescribe it.

In terms of the state’s Liberal Party, they have made the bold move to reassure Victorian voters that they will be seeing them with a far greater range of people, both from other states and non-state citizens.

In order to avoid these worryingly high number of Victorian not having plans, Victorian voters need to be prepared for these people to flood their social media with outrage over everything from stupid dog-talks, to the fact that their wrong-headed plan of a ‘health workweek’ isn’t going to stop them getting a massive windfall from some Victorian company.

It is worth noting that almost nobody in Victoria actually thinks they’ll be better off financially than people who voted for the ALP in last election.

As well as the beautiful waterways, brilliant sunshine and cold, warm weather, Victoria is home to a whole community of New South Welshmen – with more than enough in the air to make life worth living.

It is a Blue Mountains phenomenon that is a real selling point for most people who are sick and tired of living in one of the most wilful regressive depressions in Australia.

Victoria has voted three times for Tony Abbott, which was the first state to have an elected Liberal Premier since the early 1990s, and it would seem that there is very little the Victorians can do about it.

The NSW result was a shock as well. While the Northern Beaches and Townsville, West have always been a Liberal stronghold, this new record-breaking non-Sudanese-Australian stronghold in Sydney has forced many Liberals into the state they are only nominally supporting.

Voters who identify as Liberal should be advised that they are a real minority in Sydney, and they need to be mindful of the fact that they need to respect the people who voted for them in the last election.

It is for this reason that NSW Liberal Party will be inviting everybody that voted for them to come and join the Liberal party. With the promise of an opportunity to learn more about this community.

Northern Beaches Reportedly Nonplussed By Mutated Himalayan Flower

TEXT:

If you were stranded on the plains of the Altiplano from the North, you would’ve had to seek refuge from the surrounding mountains in a place known as the Snowy Range National Park.

These days, the area is infamous as the country’s ‘No Fear’ National Park, where locals say they can expect to be killed by wolves or stopped by mountain lions.

Since it was established in 1936, the park has seen a fantastic rise in invasive species. As the name implies, the area is famous for a certain type of plant life – and has seen it thrive in the concentration of upper-middle class residents.

The area was once a peaceful wildlife reserve, until a couple of locals decided to christen it the Snowy Range National Park. The locals didn’t really have a problem with the area until a few years ago when someone got detained on the mainland for having a horn that they had planted on a tree trunk.

Locals are now looking for any sign of tourism and animal activity, but are worried they won’t be able to stop it if the population continues to grow.

Kid In Bed

TEXT:

A 13-year-old boy has made the heartbreaking decision to lock himself in his bedroom at night, after his parent discovered his unsupervised use of a mobile phone while attempting to charge his laptop.

Colin Rogers, who is home-schooled by his father, told The Advocate that he didn’t want to be left without an escape hatch this afternoon.

After ringing his mother’s number, he was told he needed to call her soon as he got home because he had a charger that was "on the way out".

Colin’s mum, Laura, was informed of his decision when she rang his father’s phone, believing he was asleep.

But as she listened to Colin’s complaints, he realised it was not possible to keep your phone charged when you are locked in bed in a home with your father, as he had earlier advised.

“It looks like he’s trying to charge his phone,” said Laura.

“His bedroom is in the basement, which is dangerous, because it means he won’t be able to get to it if he has to go to work,”

“Dad has been doing that for years and he’s pretty much a month behind here, so I’m calling his number again this afternoon to see if he’s still got it. I’ve told him not to, but I don’t want to wait.”

Her reasons for getting the charger? Because he’s a grown-up and doesn’t deserve to be left without one.

Colin’s father, Ralph, told our reporters that he thought the teenage prank was as good as on and he’s glad he got it.

“It’s great,” said Ralph.

“He’s still playing with his phone, because it’s got a full charge, so he’s taking advantage of the fact that I’m playing with it at the same time, so it works out even when he’s not. I’ve got to get him one of those chargers for his own safety.”

Our reporter reached out to Colin for comment and he told us to come get him at 11.

Meeting Who’s Worrying The Most About The Climate?

TEXT:

It is widely known that Justin Bieber is the most prominent proponent of the theory that climate change is a threat to humanity and that human activity is responsible for most of the planet’s changes in climate.

These facts have led many to believe that the meeting that this little boy was attending was a big one.

That is, unless he’s a weird little man who’s not very worried about the effects of climate change on his environment, or something in between the two.

For the most part, this group of older kids are all huddled together on the front of a school bus looking for someone to talk to.

Mostly, they’re talking about their concerns over the increasing impacts of climate change and what steps they can take to mitigate them.

A few have come to their own conclusions about what they’re going to do about it.

These are the meetings, at that time, it was mainly about the disappearance of innocent people from the government-funded programs that fund them.

– What’s your name?

– Michael.

– It’s Jim” says Greg, who has an 11 dollar bill and doesn’t give a fuck about how the rest of the kids in his class are using the environment to save their own souls from the fires they created for their planet.

– What’s your name?

– Michael.

– Hey Kevin.

– Hey Momma” says the dopey little boy who’s been playing too hard, who’s been singing in church at day and partying on the weekend.

– What’s your name?

– Michael.

– Kevin, where are you from?

– It’s down here in Brisbane” says Kevin, whose parents had no idea he was a pedophile before he was reported a child molester in the 1990’s.

– Who’s the one you’re talking about?

– Michael.

– Hey!” says Brendan, who’s never met a person as blind as a pseudo-public school boy.

– Why are you so upset?

– Justin.

– I’m a boy” says Kevin, who’s just had his bet on mate Mardi Gras dismissed as a fear tactic.

– Wait until you’re talking about climate change.

– It’s just a boy that’s obsessed with the project.

– It’s all about it, and you keep painting us as the bigger problem.

– Justin.

“Hey” says the young father, who has only ever met one of his son’s girlfriends after his dad asked them to pick up a few things from the carpark outside the Skycorp venue.

“You don’t know what it’s like to be a gay man, or a feminist” says the father, who has never met a single parent as he’s completely content with helping his son put in an eight minute walk each Sunday morning.

“It’s hard to come to terms with your queerness. I don’t want to hear it” says Kevin, who’s never actually seen a gay man or woman.

“And you never, ever bring up climate change” says his father.

“Tell you what” says the son, who’s given up the fact that he’s never had to visit his local Cashew & Pogostick, and is now a stranger in his own mind.

“I’m a boy!”

“I’m a lost boy. I’m a lost hero”

“We’ve got all this global warming bullshit to worry about, but the odds of a male journalist taking a job at the ABC after that are slim to none.”

“Why are you crying?”

“I’ve got six kids and I love them all. Get on with the job”

Millennial Getting Grown Up Did You Know She Was A Femme Fatale

TEXT:

As the modern world comes to terms with the fact that we no longer live in a pre-feminist world, we can all agree that Nicola Sturgeon was a classic example of a 'grown up’.

The reigning Scottish Scottish Cup winner was a genuine figure of fun, and fun a Scottish woman, after she shook the hand of a Scottish boy playing soccer in the late 1990s.

Nicola Sturgeon’s boss in Scottish football, Gordon Tallis, said that he never knew that a Scottish woman was able to score a hat-trick as part of her game – and he was actually quite surprised she had achieved it at all.

She also had a great taste in football. In fact, she says she was a good player, after learning the rules and all that shit.”

“So I told him I would be playing for the New Zealand women in the Rio Olympics.”

“The last thing I said was that I’m a little bit rusty from playing with some of the Australian players and things like that,” he said.

“Anyway, he said ‘Yeah righto,’ and we both smiled and I just got that weird nod that’s so fucking weird, like he knew that I was a girl.”

The Advocate caught up with Nicola after the conversation with Gordon had taken place.

She told us that he knew she was a grown up, but at the same time, he knew she was a grown up because he smiled at her as he was saying it.

“So yeah, the next day I was playing with my younger brother at the local pub with my parents and they saw me coming in the other side of the room and they turned to look at me but I was walking towards Gordon’s cubicle,” she said.

“Gordon, I don’t wanna see your face.”

Boomers Looking Forward To Seeing The Beauty In 2018 

TEXT:

Boomers and expats alike are lining up outside their local SCA to celebrate this year, with some even going as far as to run inside to look at the ceilings.

While it appears very similar to what you would see on a factory floor, local boomers have made the executive decision to buy their tickets at the SCA, as it can be pretty much the only place in Sydney with a good selection of booths.

This means that they are actually the only ones that are technically eligible to join the convention’s Board.

This also means that they are the only ones that are actually dealing with some real life issues.

So for the next few weeks, everyone that can will be happily attending the SCA, as the SCA does their best to defend the legacy of the original event.

Including, but not limited to, retirees, people that live in the Western Suburbs and people that like The Golden State Warriors.

Whether you are a serious music enthusiast that wants to listen to The Eagles or the latest pop star to hit your town, everyone is welcome.

We have a strict policy when it comes to inviting out-of-towners, in order to not invite people from the bottom drawer of society.

We’d ask that you give your old friends and local politicians a chance to speak, but they do tend to get a bit upset when they realise you are really only dealing with your local types.

So this year, you can get up to 7 weeks free admission, which you can cancel at any time, with a place locked in a two-week period.

Phil Robertson Calls For Big Ban On Smoking Until Church Exempts Smoking

TEXT:

One Nation leader, and one of the loudest voices in the Australian pro-pork movement, Pauline Hanson, is calling for a ban on smoking while in the church, as well as on public transport and in restaurants.

This comes as the One Nation party’s national leader, Mike’s a big supporter of banning smoking on all public transport, in an effort to prevent anyone from getting injured.

While this may seem like a moderate position that one would find in an anti-smoking group, a recent survey of locals has found that not even one percent of the local population has a smoker in their midst.

At least 1,100 people responded to the survey, by which some 50 people are said to have gone for a smoke.

Sydney Girls Back Their Delicate Hip-Hop Music With KAP-Only Vocals

TEXT:

KAP City-based rappers are starting to notice that they aren’t the only rappers in town who make a real effort to rhyme their rhymes.

For the first time in their young adult life, some local girls are really starting to make an effort with the gospel.

The Gospel Girls from the New South Wales's Koorienda Beach are a popular minority in the North-Western region of the state, particularly in far south-west Sydney’s Sydney Hills.

With KAP’s iconic song writing ability, these uptight, state-controlled yahoo girls have combined with their background in hip hop music to create a compelling narrative of rippling soulful female vocals with a touch of grime and grit.

City-based rappers say they now realise that the keunga-geek culture in NSW is really really quite cool, as well as a real showcase of talented young women who aren’t afraid to be a bit wild.

“It’s really a refreshing thing for the state to have on here, especially with all the macho drama and testosterone that has been built up around the boys since the moment that post-NSW state election greatness wonky” says one local hoodrat, Breezizzle.

Breezizzle points out that she used to idolise those sugary sweet females who were able to rap their way out of almost any situation.

“Back in the day, when I was still hip, I used to feel a little bit jealous. These girls would be able to name their own rhymes, and it’d be on the back of their mom’s fucking mother, who I’ve never met”

Victorian’s SUV or SUV-like ute tour described as “The most important day of the year”

TEXT:

A social media storm has developed over a Victorian man who’s parked his 2013 Jaguar XKR on his father’s driveway after a busy afternoon visiting his mother and sister at the Dandenong Country Club.

Facing the wrath of the wider Cairns community, Stan Meldrum said he’s taking the situation pretty serious when he parked his 2017 Jaguar XKR on the driveway of his father’s stationwagon after his mother left for the evening.

The 39-year-old late model SUV-type ute has received widespread condemnation on social media for being the type of ute that’d be allowed on the streets if they had headlights on and no mirrors,” he said.

“If I know my father is cruising for a new ute, he’s pretty good with how the old one ran. I dunno, I just don’t know how he’s going to get home when he hears some of these low socio-economic southern blokes throwing around the word ute. I mean, he’s just a bloke with bad teeth and a problem with pokies,”

“But anyway, the idea of the issue was that he parked his ute in the driveway without having to go down to the shop. No mess, the dealer also could’ve let it in if he didn’t.”

Mr Meldrum’s mother, Sylvia, said she’d rather be in the country than see her son had to suffer through the indignity of spending his son’s ute waiting for him at the repair shop, and in turn, having to spend half his weekly wage on fuel.

“It’s just not fair,” she said.

“We don’t deserve to spend half my weekly wage on fuel and our ute not showing any sign of a mechanic,”

“I’d prefer he go out to the bush and not put his car up on the inside of the moment it’s bought. He’s going to need a bush bike or something. The ute is only there for the job, and I’m going to pick him up a few spare bits in the town where it’s right on the money.”

Cathy Newman Joins Chris Pyne As Special Envoy To Rainbow Sydney

Former Queensland premier Cathy had a rare moment of political reality after being announced as a possible candidate for the newly created role of special envoy to the nation’s LGBTI community.

Ms Newman, who was considered a frontrunner for the role of the nation’s top lesbian, revealed her decision to jump up a level to a vacant cabinet role she had previously occupied as Queensland’s minister for families and children.

She has been described as the former leader of the Queensland Liberal Party as well as a lesbian in her own right.

“This is incredible,” said one LGBTI activist.

“My dream of being the Queensland Premier has been dashed. I’m going to send my deputy Julie Bishop out on her own terms,”

“This is what it feels like.”

The Leader of the Opposition and special envoy to the nation’s LGBTI community, Chris Pyne, said he was ‘excited’ to be in the mix and Cathy was ‘a great choice’ for the job.

“I think she is exactly the right person to lead this country into the 21st century. And it’s exactly what Australia needs to do for equality,” said Mr Pyne.

“She knows exactly what equality is about. Family values, fair go policies and stopping the perversion of our natural family unit. So we will be making a great Australian ambassador for equality.”

It is believed that Cathy has only made a public appearance in local media recently, where she was seen wearing a black leather dress with the SMP rainbow logo on the back.

Report: The NSW State Government Has Had An An Inordinate Amount Of Contact With Unhealthy Sickness In New Farm

TEXT:

An independent report commissioned by the NSW State Government has today found that the NSW State Government has had an an excessive amount of contact with unhealthy sickness in the state capital and its effect on the health of NSWers.

The report found that every single day the NSW State Government comes into contact with sick and dying people in Sydney, the State Government is required to respond by spending approximately $400,000 on more hospital beds.

The NSW State Government also has had an inordinate amount of contact with unhealthy sickness in other parts of the state and around the country, despite the fact that the State Government is determined to not spend any money on health care that doesn’t come from NSWers.

The Advocate spoke to the Chief of Staff of the NSW State Government, Bernice Reece-Curry, about the findings.

“I mean, I can’t understand why NSW’s aren’t acting on this,” she said.

“I mean, every time a bedsheet falls off at the footy, the Premier of NSW says he’s going to book the EMTs to help treat the unfortunate blokes in the hospital,”

“A bedsheet falls off and the Premier of NSW is still sitting there saying it’s not his problem,”

“It’s not a great start to the afternoon, but it’s a great start to a great day.”

The Chief of Staff also explained that despite the fact that the NSW Government spends approximately $400,000 per head on sick and dying people in Sydney, the people of NSW are determined to not spend any money on the State Government.

Matt Corby Amazed By Network’s No-Consent Policy Regarding #MeToo Campaign

TEXT:

“This is what democracy looks like” says Matt Corby, a retired cattle grazier from Denseley, who is a voice in the Australian media landscape.

Corby, who has been outspoken about the importance of media fair play, has today called on the nation’s major news networks to ‘move on’ from the #MeToo hashtag campaign.

He says this is a question that Australians are not yet ready to answer, especially after the release of a damning report into the ABC, which has resulted in the dismissal of over 800 staff – and the subsequent resignation of several former journalists.

“This is our opportunity to be heard, and to make a change” he says.

“I mean, it’s not like we can ‘move on’ – we’ve got a long way to go. The way the media works is that they’re there to serve the public interest, and to provide balance – and balance is often served by controlling media.

“But there is a lot we can do” he said.

“We could get away with doing things like forcing journalists to live in squalid conditions, or force them to go to exotic locations – just like the top of Mt Etna”

However, Corby says that the ABC is ‘out of touch’ with the nation’s youngest audience, which is part of the reason why he’s pushing for change.

“I mean, the public broadcaster is owned by the same company that owns the Sydney Cricket Ground. I mean, what’s the understanding between the two?”

“This is all bullshit. We can’t move on without all of these new owners. That’s my view”

The women of New Farm, in the New South Wales South-East corner, are today back on the streets of their home town, after a weekend of drinking and partying that got them a job at the local police station.

This comes as a recent report by the National Party has found that over 95% of people under the age of 30 have never been to a primary school, let alone the inner city of Sydney – let alone the beaches of the Gold Coast.

“We just need to find the right venue” says Donna Ogbe, a 24-year-old from the town.

“Like some old boy bar, where you have to kind of ride out the first hour on the bar' before the night falls. That’s the way we do it in the Gold Coast”

While Donna’s dad is a police officer in the nearby Moss Side precinct, her mum is a nurse in the deep north – and her five brothers and sisters are law clerks in North Sydney – the town where Malcolm Turnbull was born and raised.

“There’s a certain social stigma that surrounds the Bay of Plenty” says Donna’s dad, Stephen.

“If we get picked up by the cops on the way home from work, we’re always trying to go and get the licence plate on a Hawker Hunter’s BFL”

“I’ve got a lot of ideas. I’ll talk to you in a bit, I’ll send you some emails. Don’t be shy,”

“Malcolm X. He’s the one that got me elected into the National Party. He’s the one that gave me my first job. He’s the one that gave me my Aboriginal justice hat. He’s the one that made me stand up to the powerful.”

The powerful, the rich and the well-connected all speak in Shorten’s praises, as well as all the other influential people in the country that speak differently to him.

While he won’t necessarily agree with all those people, he says he’s going to read some books as soon as he gets a chance.

“It’s not the same as what you and I read. I just want to know more about Malcolm X. More about the guy is he wasn’t a racist?”

The Advocate reached out to The Man and The Nation for comment but have yet to receive a reply. 

More to come.

Local Bishop To Read Matthew Reilly’s Next Book After Vatican Confirms He Can Walk On Water

TEXT:

After three weeks in the Vatican City, Australia’s most senior Catholic figure has confirmed that he is ready to start being a bit more Australian, after Vatican City Mayor Federico Lombardi made it clear that he will be praying for the former stinky mongrel Liberal Member for Cooktown.

Cardinal George Pell, who led the Catholic Church from about 30 years ago, is a famous name amongst the people of Australia for being one of the last few leaders of the church who actually gave a fuck about what is going on in the world, and had the balls to do it.

This comes after he publicly agreed with Federico Lombardi’s call to end abortion.

Teaching Drum Lessons To Kids Obnoxiously Hardens Their Vitals

TEXT:

A growing body of research is indicating that the educational institutions and government agencies should focus on improving the quality of life for those in the nation’s community who have developed a hard time attaining the highest spiritual maturity, in order to help teach the next generation to be as well-adjusted as the previous generation.

Australia’s leading academic study of mindfulness and meditation has concluded that the most effective way to improve the well-being of someone who has developed a major problem with being alive, is through providing them with intensive, realistic, ongoing mindfulness and meditation classes at a local primary school.

“These kids are so starved for education, so dejected, so in need of a way out,” said the senior researcher, Professor Ben Flower.

“They need a chance at a bit of a renaissance, a chance at being okay with mortality. A chance to change.”

The study has also found that many of these kids are also quite vocal about it.

One 10-year-old claimed that he has had a hard time adjusting to his dying planet, a statement made by an expert, who has spent 25 years studying people who claim to be ‘post-collapse’.

However, despite the harrowing statistics, some religious groups say that this information is something that can help educate these kids.

The leaders of the Australian Council For Research On Mind and Soul (ACCORD) say their work is often compromised by the ‘survivalism’ that sometimes comes with being born on the planet that we’ve elected to worship.

“We often have to be very careful about what we want to research because people who are vulnerable to this sort of thinking can often just lie about how they feel, or have no real issue with dying and asking for a tree in the middle of a bush,” said the lead researcher, Professor Damien Grogan.

“But as it stands, we’ve found that these kids, these young kids can be quite susceptible to this sort of thinking,” he said.

“If they have a hard time attaining spiritual maturity, we know that by talking about it, there’s a possibility that they will be dying, too.”

“How Do I Know It’s my Phone?” Asks Young Liberal Confused By Milano’s Private School Affiliation

TEXT:

The Advocate reached out to the young brother of a prominent Liberal, Alex Milano, for comment on his mobile phone this morning after he returned from an early lunch with his peers.

The visibly young Liberal said he’s starting to get confused by the milo-s lifestyle.

“I guess I guess you can call me a milo, huh?” said Alex.

“Yeah so I guess I’m a milo, huh? How do I know?”

Our reporters reached out to the enigmatic young man for comment but he was too busy to reply right now.

However, he did respond, explaining that he thinks it’s pretty funny that you guys don’t know who he is.

“He’s from a private school. I guess you could call me a private school boy, huh? Yeah but I don’t really like the sound of that.”

“[laughter] I just don’t think it’s really a good look. You guys are just so obsessed with him, I don’t know how you guys haven’t noticed.”

“He’s from a private school. Why did you bring up this?”

Our reporter laughed and told Alex the story as a whole.

“Is that a question you’re not sure about?”

His laughter was cut off by a classmate.

“Well, we’ve gotta talk about my milo, Alex. He’s from a private school. He knows who I am,” said the classmate.

“Which school? The Whooton School, or the Polytechnic?”

Alex’s laugh grew to a full-on laugh, like it was a cue ball.

“You wanna hear the funny part? When I left my mum’s old boarding school and went into my old boarding school, there was no homework. None! My old school was so strict, they told me to be quiet or else I’d be late. So I was already late most nights,”

“So they called me up to ask if I wanted to be late again. You know what? They told me I was late again. They said I’d have to come to school to change.”

“Oh My God, Where Have You Been?” Asks Old Coworker Who Used To Be Mr Sport

TEXT:

A local casual fan of the Gold Coast Suns is curious as to where you have been over the last few years, and asks the question of the casual fan in this space, ‘Oh My God, Where Have You Been?’ – often used to get a strong connection with a particular player from the club.

“Where have you been?”

This question often goes without prompting other than a brief acknowledgement that a player has been in the wrong team for a while, then a question about where they had been. The answer often is that they had been somewhere else or had just been playing a few NRL games.

The ‘Oh My God, Where Have You Been?’ question has been used in a wide variety of situations throughout the modern NRL. In a recent study conducted by the Betoota Advocate, the word’s usage was found to be most common in the lead up to a team meeting, when a boardroom meeting is usually held.

In situations where the chat is already being held in a heated forum, the question is asked a number of times, before the team goes to the lunch break for lunch, or after a game against a team they are significantly underdogs against.

It is also found that the most common use of ‘Where Have You Been?’ is after a meeting where the members are getting burnt out and exhausted, but aren’t yet 100% committed to their decision, despite the entire team being older than them and with more experience.

Another study was conducted into the behaviours of players and coaches when the question is posed to them, and what they tell the non-league-footballing age players who ask them.

“I dunno, I think it’s funny but I got kinda fed up when they started making the poor handsy reference to a player by name, but by the end of it, I was asking them to swear before there was a disconnect between them and me and they just laughed at me,” he said.

“Pretty messed up, didn’t it?”

Universe Rewards Program Giving Alarmingly-Degenerate Men Who Descend More Than Just A Mother

TEXT:

Following on from the shocking announcement of some undereducated first-graders who have allegedly 'brought shame on the family’ today, The Betoota Advocate can today reveal that there is a more sinister motivation at play.

It is believed that some of the men are being forced to take on the responsibility of starting a new family, by the Federation’s vision for the future of the Universe.

This revelation comes as a result of The Betoota Advocate‘s revealing recent investigation into the reality television programme, Married At First Sight.

“We here at The Advocate are united by the love of the country for telling these unsavoury stories,” said Betoota Advocate Editor-at-Large, Dr. Clancy Overell.

“There’s something very immoral about it all, but that’s not our main concern,” Dr. Overell continued.

“What we want to find out is why these men are being forced to begin anew. Whether it’s physically, whether it’s through pregnancy or whether it’s through their own untimely deaths.”

The Advocate reached out to a number of the men involved in the program, but all declined to comment, citing that they were ‘family-owned’ and ‘unlikely to have children.

However, one man did offer some insight into the mindsets of these men, explaining that he is a true blue cock of a man.

“What I tell these guys is that I have a daughter in law, who I’ve had for close to two decades. I’ve known her since I was in high school,” he said.

“I’ve known her since we’ve been going out on the town together. I’m a former ambassador, I can’t think of a better career for me to be in. If they want to become stars in the game, they should send their kids to the same school as I do,”

“The only downside would be the prospect of having to read over their shoulder about every single thing they’re doing, but that’s a small price to pay for having a cup of coffee and a light breakfast each morning.”

Bureau Of Meteorology Acquires Influx Of Hard Rain From Long Separate Location In West To Take Away Stress From High

TEXT:

The strong south-westerly winds of the past 48 hours have had a huge effect on the Betoota City Limits.

Along the city limits, the rain has been heavy, particularly in the CBD, where the highest rainfall totals have been reached in the past week.

This has lead to many residents assuming that the hardest hit place in the country is actually the north of the river, where the rainfall is closest to the centre.

The rain is also affecting the main draw on the city limits, the Dunkeld Recreation and Artesian Reserve, which have also been the hardest hit by the last few days of heavy rain.

The fact that the top of the monsoonal trough has blown south to the north-west has also had a huge effect on this region, which has been a big hit for the rain in the past few days.

The RAR has been rocked by the recent heavy rainfall, which is the worst on record for the region, according to the Bureau of Meteorology.

On Thursday, the district received 11 inches, breaking a longstanding record.

Following a period of intense rain, the area was hit hard by severe flooding, with many residents pondering whether they’d made the right decision about the daily monsoonal trough, or whether it was just going to pass by without much warning.

“It’s been a real wet patch,” said one young urbanist from Betoota’s Rain Country Facebook page.

“That’s why I had the head gumption to leave my phone at home, and went to a friend’s place to ask them if it’s okay if I tell them how much this town is hurting,”

“They didn’t think so.”

The research has been published in the online journal of the Royal Society of Betoota.

ABC Celebrates 100 Years In Reality By Going Big And Telling People That Their Television Is Dead

TEXT:

The Coalition has accused the ABC of a double standard in their treatment of social issues by presenting factually incorrect and sensationalised news reports.

The moment the network reaches a point where people listen to them, The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) will attack them with the likely intention of stifling dissent and undermining their ability to make money.

The Federal Government wants to block the ABC from the internet for the next 5 years, which is a means to stop the ABC from continuing to broadcast lies that destroy our way of life.

The ABC claims the program is “Australia’s highest quality, accessible and useful educational institution” –  which is something to get excited about.

In addition to this, the ABC claims their ratings have never gone down and that they are actually “the only living thing the community cares about” – which is absolutely bizarre as their business model has always depended on churning out factually incorrect and sensationalised news stories.

The fact that there is no transparency and accountability within the ABC industry, or the Government for that matter, is beyond the pale.

Some of the ABC’s most prominent figures, namely, Tony Jones, have been instrumental in keeping the public trust in their news and current affairs programmes, leading to an incredible amount of self-censorship.

For example, nothing says “coalition spin doctor” like a smörgåsbord of relevant but completely dishonest information.

As Tony Jones points out in his popular Radio National’s The Jones Report, if you want to know what the big issues in Australian politics are, then you need to listen to the ABC.

And that’s exactly what the ABC do with his breakfast program, Jones Report, every morning.

“We’re the only place on the planet that tells the truth with breaking news, from the inside. It’s never edited or skewed. They’re the only place you’ll find the same level of irresponsible reporting as you find in the ABC,” says Tony Jones.

Jones says that his show is meant for people like you, people who are fed up with being lied to by a media which keeps pushing propaganda and outright lies.

“All I do is tell people that I don’t agree with those people and that the ABC is full of dishonest and sensationalised reporting. The ABC is the only place to read it. I don’t even like their Len ‘Sporkful Of Times’ Morisset,” says Jones.

“But I’m trying to make a point of it. They’re the only media which tells it like it is,”

“It’s very refreshing, but”

Jones has promised to return to The ABC “at some point” after the Senate votes.

Female Poltergeist Returns From 8-Year Anniversary With New Streak

TEXT:

AN EMPTY ADOLESCENT NEIGHBOR HAS JUST sat down with our reporter this morning in the smoking patio area of a prominent Melbourne sex-cafe, talking about his recent 8-year absence.

The man, whom we interviewed here outside the popular nightspot, says he’s just enjoyed his last 12 years living in the city. That, as well as his entire adult life, now comes to an end.

“I’m just moving on now,” said the man, who spoke to The Advocate on the streets of Melbourne’s fashionable Irish Quarter.

“All of my old stuff. The Madonna, the Thirsty Hippo and that motorcycle…. I’ve been watching them go down. The place used to be called the House Of Passion. Back in the day it was called the Paris House or something to that effect,”

“I’ve been missing out on a lot of mates because I’m just so out of tune and out of touch with the rest of the world. Everything is too fast, too. This city is just too small.”

The cafe owner, Michael Laming, says he’s been living in Melbourne for eight years now and he’s always been in the scene, even when he lived in Brisbane.

“It’s just sad, it is,” he said.

“Look, I know I’m not asking for too much. You’ve got all the right people moving in here. And the young people are very attractive. But this city is simply dying. It’s just a sad state of affairs,”

“But yeah. The ladies are hotter than fuck. I guess you could say that I’m just a tired old male. But I love this place and I don’t give a fuck about what the district is up to.”

Portugal Unveils New Emu Export For Down Under

TEXT:

AN IMPORTANT UPDATE:

The people of Portugal have today revealed that they’ve been anxiously awaiting this particular imported fruit for nearly a year, because they have been under a very real threat of not being able to feed their growing population.

As of today, that threat has come to an end.

This means that the people of Portugal now have to really worry about how they’re going to feed their population, given their limited natural resources, and what can be found within their borders.

So with that, the people of Portugal have today proudly announced their new export: the emu pomelo, which is the largest of the three Portuguese lily trees, and the only one that they’ve been able to import.

The news comes after Portugal has announced they’ll be importing an undisclosed number of exotic lily varieties this year, with an ongoing inspection of existing export markets.

This announcement was made prior to a visit by Prime Minister Xavier García de Mina’s office this morning, with De Mina, who’s been publicly criticised for not doing more about reducing the number of non-essential people and goods entering the country, appearing to offer his government more funds to educate foreign investors about the economic realities of the existing port, and then making it clear that he doesn’t care much for what’s happened here.

The announcement has drawn widespread criticism, particularly amongst the small island nation’s financial elite, who have been complaining that the unprecedented influx of non-Portuguese people into the country will cost them much more than the death of one child is about to, because they’re losing their home island home to immigration.

The government is yet to comment on the accusations that it’s creating an unequal society and that it’s taking the welfare of people who work hard and who live on the land, especially on the southern fringe of the country.

“It’s a new thing, I know” says Xavier’s wife, Rosie, who is standing behind the press secretary.

“For the past eight years we’ve had these men and women coming into our country, but not for the lucrative jobs that we’ve given them – because they didn’t have jobs!”

“But now, now that we’ve got these people coming here, it’s just insane. It’s just insane that they feel like they have to be in prison, but they don’t have a job!”

“I hope this man knows we’re losing our independence from Portugal, because his leadership has not been good enough. We need someone who can pull a rabbit out of the hat and pull the country out of recession with an iron fist!”

Palmer Torres Returns To Job In Which He Was Coached By Paul Gallen

TEXT:

The controversial tennis star turned opposition leader, Paul Gallen, has returned to the job he was rostered by Paul Gallen when he last attempted to play for Australia.

The Liberal Party, as is tradition, likes to lean left on controversial and hot button issues such as cannabis, the environment, immigration and tax, to name a few.

The career politician and the man that many of his colleagues are angry with, despite having much less influence on policy than him, has today signed with a major US sports franchises to coach the Wallabies in the upcoming World Cup in Brazil.

As a coach, Paul Gallen will have a very tough task ahead of him, as the Wallabies look to rebuild their team in the wake of their defeat in the Rugby World Cup earlier this year.

While Paul Gallen will be receiving his coaching load from the likes of Kevin Cheveldayoff and Adam Zampa, it is expected that the regular senior players will be told to make sure their feet are on the gas before Gallen arrives in Brazil – as the Australian tradition dictates.

The news comes after the outspoken former sports stars coach was seen sporting a Grateful Dead t-shirt earlier this week.

“It’s an interesting choice,” said a Blooper who asked to remain anonymous.

“I don’t think they are going to force him back in to the Australian side and probably won’t be able to get him back at the level he was playing at, but you never know with the national team. He could be a good mentor if he has one.”

The pair, who have been accused of pushing a divisive political agenda while refusing to condemn the incredibly bizarre political party they are in, also said they were committed to helping young Australian athletes get into the Sydney Olympics, as well as helping Canberra cricket develop a career.

He has reportedly been attending the MAFS shows for nearly a decade and for the past few years, he has had no problems with being there, according to a number of local female colleagues.

“He goes through a whole season of MAFS, just bingeing and wanking and eating shit for no reason and no one knows,” said one female reporter.

“You can just tell when he’s there. He’s been going all out the last few times we’ve gone up there. We get him a lamb or vege dinner every night, he’s like sat down at his dinner table, he’s just been getting into it,”

“It’s so fucking cool. I mean, I know he’s full on on shithouse on a number of shows but, I’ve seen him go through a season with just one or two shows, so it’s impressive.”

Another female staffer agreed with our report and said that Andrew Bolt is a refreshing change to what the average suburban news reporter is like.

“He is a true hero,” they said.

“He just has to stay there and do all the hard work like balance and kick,”

Monks No Longer Allowed To Directly Address God On The Way To Work

It has been confirmed today that monks will no longer be allowed to directly address God while they are in the vicinity of a church or other worship location.

This comes as the Monastery and College of the Holy Cross (the lower tier monasteries) and the C.W.F.S (c.w.f.s) (C.W.F.S Monastery and Stations of Worship) have today announced that monks will no longer be directly addressing God on the way to work.

It has also been confirmed that the title of the Zen Master will no longer be Zen and the other titles will continue to be given out according to what happens on the road to your head.

“This news is quite concerning to me, considering I am the only former-student who has been allowed to call God a Zen Master,” said one prominent Zen master who asked to remain anonymous.

“For some reason, the Monastery and C.W.F.S decided that the only people allowed to call God a Zen Master will be those who have experienced first-hand the lives of the Zen monks, or former-student Monks who’ve been gifted Zen as a gift by the Emperor at this very moment.”

“I’m afraid that, in order to remain as close to the ancient tradition as possible, I must now direct all my energies and energies towards healing the sick, as well as other more pressing matters of this nature.”

The announcement comes after some 18-year-old Monks at the Whooton Unversity were caught on camera pinning down and pinching a police dog so it’d be less likely it’d get frightened, and more likely it’d make a mistake and bite someone.

It has been confirmed those actions could land them in serious trouble with the code of silence, and the C.W.F.S has today announced they’ll be taking them to court if they don’t stop.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott has been spotted at a local meeting of the Betoota Branch of the Local, Unions, Football Leagues Association (LLRFSA) this morning, where he was reportedly acting like the local MP they need him to be.

The PM has been hanging around the meeting with a few politicians and representatives from the NRL and AFL, telling them that he can’t remember who they are, and that the best place for him to stay for now is in the arms of a local Liberal MP.

This comes after the Prime Minister appeared at a meeting of the Liberal Party’s Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee (LCPA) this morning, where he was tasked with helping to ensure that some of the current Liberal party members who have received their current pay, got their pensions.

“Hey yos, [hysterical laughter]

“If you don’t get your affairs straight, then it’s a good opportunity to have a crack at the caucuses, I don’t know. You’d get a look at me in a suit after this, ya?”

The Member for Warringah, David Littleproud, who was part of the Liberal Party’s upper cabinet at the time, also took the opportunity to break down in tears before going on to explain that it is hard to keep his hands straight when you are caught up in the sin of politics.

“I used to be part of a happy clap in high school, I’m going for a nice long spell in the Howard government… I’ll be one of the first to go”

“Oh yeah, there’s also this great unwritten rule about being a member of the Liberal Party doesn’t make you an official member of the Labor Party, but you never know.”

“It’s just such a shame that my friends at the other end of town aren’t as keen on joining us as the rest of the country, but at the same time, they aren’t as keen to become members of the Labor party”

Nation To Follow Innovation And Deploy Commercial Tax Credits Lesson If “Taxpayer’s Bail” Is Full

TEXT:

The Government of Australia is moving to further incentivise and enhance the use of tax credit for people who have a low income by reducing the number of lessons taxpayers receive about it.

Lead by Minister for Finance and Minister for Small and Family Business, Bill Shorten, the government announced today that the government will spend $10 million over the next four years to encourage young people who are currently saddled with low income to take out a one-time loan of $40,000 to teach them how to pay their debts.

This would reduce the amount of tax paid by taxpayers, with the proceeds of the tax credit being directed back into the economy and building better housing.

The changes mean that taxpayers will no longer receive a lesson on how to pay your debts once they are repaid, and will instead be taught about cost-efficient and reliable ways to pay them.

This announcement comes after a recent report by the Australian Tax Office has found that those who are on low income and without any form of work experience will almost never learn how to pay their debts.

Tony Abbott Calls For Australian Scientists To Come Together And Study This Feeling

TEXT:

Prime Minister Tony Abbott has today announced that he will call a special meeting of the Parliamentary Council and request a study into the feelings of Australia’s scientist’s.

Abbott says the matter has arisen as a result of the
unhelpful media coverage given to his government’s research into homosexuality and the destruction of marriage, and how that has permeated into our national institutions.

“These feelings have been described to us by a number of national scientists, as a result of the media attention they have received over the last few months”

“What we have found is that when a very public and ruthless survey is conducted by the nation’s scientific community into how many people they really don’t know, the number can vary wildly depending on who is conducting it,”

Abbott, who hasn’t been a scientist for many years, says that the media should not treat this research as a journalistic exercise, but as a threat to our democracy.

“I know it is hard to get people to talk about something that they are not actively aware of, but the truth is there is a very real threat to our democracy that was never addressed,”

State Of Origin Preview: Major Episode Or Episode?

TEXT:

The Origin is a competition that determines who is the best representative of New South Wales. It is held annually, in a best-of-three, decider between the NSW State of Origin and Queensland.

This year’s winners and losers were revealed this morning during the competition’s livestream on Facebook Live.

The NSW Origin decider was streamed live to all of Australia as the competition’s flagship Facebook page.

In a shock result, the final result showed the Origin winner Luke Keary defeating Queensland side Sonny Bill Williams by unanimous decision, round one, six votes.

“It was a close call” said NSW Origin player, Broncs Brodie Croft.

“Bill Williams had the last laugh, he’s the one who deserves the title”

This result has many commentators, including the football writers for The Sydney Morning Herald, questioning just how close the two football giants were come round.

“Was it really close, for some reason” said one sports journalist.

“Williams may have edged Williams in the end, but for some reason it was still close, for whatever reason”

Rapidly Unsuccessful Boot Camp Owner Refers To His Battles With Lost Buddy With A Word Like ‘Goose’

TEXT:

A small business owner from the small south-west town of Betoota has put some of his less successful kids through a virtual boot camp today.

With a cool breeze in his hair and a surprisingly stable pair of steed boots, Billy Bean (33) says he’s always been good at getting the bush.

“I went to a big school, good education. Didn’t get into a real job, so I used to be able to get up to whatever job I wanted,” he said.

“But I’m not really good at defending myself from a few spear throwing moleskins. They go to a real school. Anyway, [back to back] I was doing it”

“So it’s nice to be able to prove to the world that I’ve actually been a real good footy player. God damn it, man. It was all a bit of a teach”

As Billy’s kids enjoy the unique and important cultural traditions offered in their town’s thriving bush, he stops the most boring news brief in the country and tells the story of how he set himself up for this past season.

“I was out getting into a few early flights with some friends in Betoota’s Old City District. Then we went down to this dodgy little hole house just down the road, I haven’t been down there since I was at my boarding school.”

“A couple of the boys were really chuffed when they saw I was getting the boot camp boot camp type jobs, they’d asked me to come to the Old City District. They thought I was a real gem.”

“Anyway, I’m sitting at home getting uni in for a while now, the week starts here.”

Plastic Shoe Sales Hop Ahead Of 5% Increase In Weekly Average Purchasing Levels

TEXT:

The weekly purchasing levels of plastic shoe scales are on the rise, with many young women opting to buy larger and heavier sizes in an effort to stay slim.

“It’s easier said than done,” she said.

“There’s a lot of pressure to always be slender at all times, it’s just too much to be skinny,”

“I’m trying to sell them as small as possible though. I’ve had to come to terms with the fact that they are never going to be as comfortable as a man, and that’s a price you have to pay.”

“Plus, you don’t get as much of a chance to wear these as you do when you get to work at work. There’s an air of luxury about them. That’s something I miss.”

However, the strong correlation between plastic shoe scales and obesity has led scientists to believe that the spikes in plastic shoe scales are a direct result of the sales, and not a cause for the rising levels of obesity amongst the young women.

The lead researcher in the study, Professor Jack Wood, explained that the spike in scales is actually just a reaction to the increased pressure put on the ladies by men.

“The plastic spikes have nothing to do with the rise in weight,” he said.

“If anything, it’s just a way for the guys to show that they know what’s up. It’s not an exercise,”

“By increasing the pressure on women to buy bigger and heavier models, the spike in scales is a direct result of the increased pressure put on the ladies by men. It’s a clear correlation between the rise in weight and the rise in demand for plastic,”

“Don’t get me wrong, I love all the plastic shoes I see on the shelves, but I don’t buy them for the soft soles, I buy them to show that I know what’s up.”

Sadist Runs Forlecto On Bus To Catch On Wires It As Frowning Face On The Turn Signal

Local man, Sean Parker (35) has been quite vocal about his dislike of public transport, particularly the public bus, and the repeated stops he makes to pick up some bread or something on the bus.

Speaking to The Advocate this morning, he told our reporter that he’s been a fan of the cult-classic Australian horror film, The Road to Nowhere, for many years.

So much so, he’s decided to catch up with some of his old school friends and run forlecto on the bus to catch on with them.

“Yeah, it’s fucked. I get on it, you know? [laughs] Yeah, it’s bloody hot. It’s like 30 degrees out here, mate. I’ve had a few drinks there,” he said to our reporter.

SYDNEY MUSICIAN SITS WITH MOUNTAINS AGAINST THE TERRORISM

TEXT:

One of our nation’s greatest living composers’ music exports has today sat down with The Advocate to discuss the recurring theme of his music becoming about something that happens to him or someone he knows.

This theme was brought up after Sydney’s newest musical institution, Mosman Music Hall, released their highly anticipated set at the iconic venue last night.

“I don’t know, man. I mean, I know what happened to Steve [Kahn] in the early 90s. I mean, he made some real money playing in bands with other bands. Not as much, you know, as some of the bands that came after him. But yeah, I’ve thought about it, yeah. They got a bit of a bounce in their hands, you know what I mean?”

“Like, there’s a bit of a Southern Comfort in that Mosman set, ahh.”

The Australian public have responded to these comments with a large number of people flooding social media with their deepest and most heartfelt comments.

From an arena-hopping quadriplegic with Parkinson’s Disease, to a local AFL fan with a truly pensive introspection, it is safe to say that Sydney’s musical community are livid at some of the ‘hatred and fearmongering’ coming from some of the mainstream media.

The most notable person to respond was Colm Tóibín, who has worked alongside Bob Dylan, Jimmy Barnes and many other iconic musicians who have died.

Tóibín took the time to talk to The Advocate about the music happening in Sydney right now and how he thinks Australian songwriters should be treated.

“Just listen to me, man. Listen to me. I’ve got a lot of serious mental health issues right now. And what’s worse, these ­glorious songwriters think their music is going to get people to the point where they can have a life’s work? Not for me, man.”

“Oh, well. [laughs] I’m still just a lowly musician and I’ve got my own shit to sell. There’s only so much I can sell. It’s fucking fucking bullshit, hey? Who needs a career that can kill you, you know?”

Bill Shorten Urged To Show More Commitment To Violence Against Women After He Was Advised To Do It Not By Just Any Members Of Labor Party

TEXT:

The leader of the opposition has been urged to keep a tighter rein on his misogynistic tendencies by a number of his more radical Labor party colleagues, after they were made aware that the soon-to-be newly-installed Prime Minister, Bill Shorten, had been urged to use his powers in Parliament to ensure that women don’t try to kill him on the spot, in the same way he was urged to take away their use of personal airtime at the same time.

“If I know my team are more of a dark horse, then I’m more than happy to put a few heads on the table,” said a tall, weak voice that was warned to never underestimate the skill level of the opposition.

“I’m very proud to have represented this country in a challenge. Now it’s time to represent my country,” said the strong, confident and unapologetic Labor party man.

“Just as long as you don’t try to kill me, you’ll be best luck to save me,” he said.

“Because I’m a one-punch knockout and if you try to kill me then I’ll knock you out before you can finish you off,”

“But for now, we’re going to make sure they don’t try to kill me, then we’ll see how we go.”

While the Labor Party is less intimidating to women than the Liberal Party, they do tend to be more popular with men – especially older, more masculine ALP stalwarts.

Local Woman Visibly Scrounging For a Golf Club Membership

TEXT:

There are many options for those seeking to become a club member.

“Do you have a membership?” asks James Beaumont (29).

“We don’t. What about you?”

“Why don’t you come down here and have a chat?”

Despite the fact that he lives in a suburb that’s only a short drive from the club, Austin has no idea how to join a local club.

“Where’s the club?” asks the young man.

“Well I’ve actually found that a good way to start is to come down here and chat with the regulars. The regulars are pretty nice so I reckon you’d like to join them,”

Austin, who spends his time around people who enjoy golfing, says he’s not an ‘atractive man who rocks a suit’, but a man who enjoys a bit of golf.

“There’s a nice group of young blokes down here called ‘The Old Boys’ and they love to throw the ball around,” says the man who’s seen him work at a local golf club for the past six years.

“A ballsy bloke called ‘Panda Frank’ once asked me to throw to him over and over again, asking me to give it a bit of a nudge. He doesn’t know I’m there,”

“So I started up on him, telling him to throw to me but he always had the edge. He finally did get me and I thought it was over until he threw another ball to me right behind the basket,”

“You know, just to let the old man know that I wasn’t afraid of him,”

“I hope he doesn’t mind me at his post,”

But to Austin’s chagrin, the old man insists that he’s already had a chat with everyone.

“Yeah, pretty obvious, man,” says the man.

“You’ll get your round one time. So long as you don’t come in and ask me to play, I’ll get you one round.”

“Tell you what, I’ll give you one round to go,”

The old man then lets Austin hang up before he leaves for the next round.

Australia Does Its Part To Help Ban Ki-Choo From Playing Again

TEXT:

One Nation leader Pauline Hanson and her team have today criticised Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull for not taking a more hard line on Australia’s longstanding trend of racially-charged drama, by accusing him of not playing his kangaroo-like role.

It’s believed the Aussies suspect that Scott Morrison has been getting a bit of a kick out of stirring up racism, but the latter came out in force today with a shock announcement that the Australian national anthem will be played in place of the Aboriginal kangaroo dance, and the new lyrics that are being prepared for tonight’s Big Bash match between the Northern Barbarians and St Kilda at the Adelaide Oval.

However, the most vocal the riled up a few quarters of the nation’s Latinos, with the media taking note of their anger over the lack of action from the nation’s leader in this country’s history.

“If you have a church that you want to protest against, protest against racism. But don’t use your church to promote your cause, use your hate for racism to take the spotlight off your hate for the white man” said one Latino family member named Javier.

“We’re tired of being politically correct on social issues. We don’t need white guilt here”

“We’re tired of having to argue over things that should be settled for now, that can wait. The future of this nation depends on Australia being a great multicultural society with a wide range of beliefs and cultures, and not just white ones”

However, with Pauline Hanson promising that if One Nation won the next election, she’ll be the first person to beat him, it seems the nation’s Latinos are not going to have a problem with him playing on their beautiful flags, because they actually are racist – but if he won’t play on their flags, then maybe they’ll need to ask their church to stop it.

Report: Musical Instruments Aren’t Always Crazy Bright

A report commissioned by the CSIRO has today confirmed the usual suspects: There’s definitely no need for musical instruments that are designed to make you feel like you are cold.

The Advocate spoke to some Australian’s about their experiences of going to concerts with loud musical instruments, and what they all said was that most of the time the instruments are downright creepy.

“What’s the big deal?” wrote Grant Hodges, a 29-year-old IT worker.

“I’ve got plenty of money to spend on my musical instruments anyway. What the fuck do these old fuckwits think they are getting us to listen to them?”

After learning that the CSIRO reports suggest that most people don’t need musical instruments to make music, Hodges decided to go one-up them with his own report.

“How the fuck do these old boys think I buy a fucking electric bass for $9 a pop if I don’t want to turn it up at all? This is medieval thinking! Fuck you!”

“This Time It’s Our Turn” Says Man Who’s Already Paid For A Pretty Good Pizza

TEXT:

After eating the racist and sexist lunch I cooked for myself, my mother told me she’s tired of being treated like a second-class citizen by Sydney’s left-wing politicians, who are also the white men who’s families they’ve chosen to ignore.

The night I decided to eat lunch, my mother said she didn’t know what to expect from the lunatic fringe, but she told me to relax and be thankful for the Labor’s core voters – who in her opinion, are not contributing at all to the nation’s progress.

She didn’t think she’d be too different.

She told me that she’s a native of a comfortable middle-class life and that the chance that any given politician will treat me like an outsider is “not very good”.

“I’m tired of all this ad hominem garbage and mean words.”

“If I had to pick, I’d vote for a man who says ‘he’s far too busy to do political work’ – and not one who literally needs to do political work.”

“There’s too many opportunities for change out here for me to waste.”

“If Labor wins power, I’d like to see them do this. I’ve spent half my life working for them.”

Our reporter spoke to Hazel Wrangham, whose children all call Sydney and make their living with a lot of cash and the promise of change, about why people vote for the Greens and what it means to be a contributing adult in Sydney.

“The Greens, as a party, are the only ones who represent us. They represent what we want,” she said.

“All they want is to be the party of minorities and the left-wing, who they don’t represent,”

“They aren’t the real majority, they are just the minority. But if I was going to vote for a genuine majority, I would still vote for the Greens because they make me feel like I’m a real majority, too,”

“But they have no chance of being a real majority in a city that doesn’t host more than 10,000 people per day. So they are off it. They are wrong,”

“And by that, I mean they are wrong because they haven’t provided a solution for water, or basic sanitation, or an end to the snub-n-snub culture that envelops Sydney”

Mid-County Swinger Looks To Get Away From The Deal And Become A Certified Virologist

Abbott: Sydney’s city skyline will be no different to Cowra

TEXT:

Former Prime Minister Tony Abbott says Sydney’s city skyline is not different to Cowra’s, despite it’s all-pervasive greenery.

Speaking this morning via telephone, Mr Abbott explained that Cowra’s skyline is the same as Sydney’s, except for the fact that they’ve retained their distinct character and character by constructing a beautiful public monument of red brick and plastered white concrete.

“What Cowra’s skyline is like, is that if you walk through it, you’ll notice a lot of what you’re looking at isn’t actually there,” Mr Abbott said.

“We’ve retained much of its character, except for a few ridges and a few curves,” he said.

“There’s no denying that Cowra is the city’s most important and most beautiful city skyline,”

“Our lobby is still lobbying the NSW Government to make it look the same, because it’s what it is.”

As the interview was ending, Mr Abbott said the senior staff in his office were whispering in his ear about a new national monument for his hometown of Cowra – a fact that made him wonder if he’d even want to speak to The Advocate any further.

Bill Shorten Spends $10m Investing In Novels That Tell He’s The True Story

TEXT:

Singer Bill Shorten has today spent close to $10m toying with the idea of not presenting himself as the real Australian, by dabbling in a literary trade that has traditionally gone unnoticed by the nation’s people.

While his time as a Senator and a person with political aspirations may be in the distant future, it has not stopped Shorten from his lavish literary pursuits that have been many years in the making.

Shorten, who is due to speak at an N.H.U conference today, told the media today that he had been an ardent reader of David Eddings’ Clio di Figaro for some time and that his unwed stay-at-home-son was the sort of person he was reading about.

“I just wanted to know more about it,” said Shorten, referring to the book and a lot more about it.

“Because the more I read, the more I thought that maybe this isn’t the sort of thing I was reading about, and I didn’t like it,”

“This story about a quiet, middle-class suburban lino-dweller who fell in love with a bit of a trash-chuck and a young priest is too much for me to handle. It’s the sort of book you read about while talking to somebody from work in the parking lot at the casino, not the kind of book you read about as a child sitting next to you on a bus in the Gold Coast,”

“It was too much for my blood.”

As a result, Shorten said he is shifting gears a bit on this year’s book binge and not planning on watching himself eat dinner alone in a nice setting in the American Psycho way, but rather watching himself drink a lot of cheap wine and eat a lot of meat.

George Pell Spotted At Sydney University With Old Boys From The Warringah MGC

TEXT:

Former High Court judge, former Prime Minister and member of the Australian royal family, George Pell has today been spotted at Sydney University, near where most of the big names in the world go to school.

Most of them are in fact ex-cons, and former fellow royals.

The former members of the royal family, which includes a number of former prominent heads of the Australian Liberal Party, including a large number of ex-prussians, have been spotted trying to be as cool as possible in their New York apartment this morning.

Pell, who also owns a large number of houses, has been living at his boutique residential residence in the Old City District for a few months now, as his kids get old enough to know better.

His eldest son, George Pellas, was spotted yesterday with his bros in the famous waterway in the French Quarter, where he was spotted hanging out with some old heads from the MGC’s Warringah mgc.

Pell is a long time fan of the Mets, especially their young core of second-tier players, as well as their staff.

“Just look at this lad, look at this bloke. They both come from such a cool, f**king country club, they are both so straight f**king texas. He’s got no idea what he is doing, he must be one of those old boys that get an old car. And they are both wearing school shirts and golf clubs, so that’s what you’ve got here”

“At least they are older than the boys”

“They are so cool”

Pell is also a big supporter of the network, saying that the core of this country should get the equivalent of a cable television package, so they can’t get all the best parts of this country’s media companies for the price of a minimum wage job in Melbourne.

“This country is working hard to get more content, more matches, more talent… We should have more matches, more talent and less expensive matches,”

“If we want to have more matches and more talent, we have to do it now. This country is working hard… If you want to buy The LNP and the Nats… You can’t do it anymore. That’s the big truth,”

Pell is also a big supporter of the new MCG Rugby League match-day experience, saying that it’s the first step towards making this country better.

“It’s the MCG match day, it’s the next big thing. I get that the NRL team are used to playing at home… But the fans are used to playing at the MCG, they don’t have to play at ANZ… They’d have to play in Melbourne, which is where the game is played. The game is up to date with the Pacific Nations Rugby League’s growth in Australia,”

“So, to the NRL players… I am always pushing for more matches, more talent and less expensive matches,”

“We should be able to afford them here… But we need more matches and they need to play in Melbourne. This country is working hard to get more matches and more talent,”

When asked if he thought he was being 'too hard on the young fella’s ego, Pell said his actions spoke louder than words.

“This country is so behind you” he said.

“We have a right to be better than you. Just look at the Gold Cup, look at the entire competition… It’s a disgrace to the game of rugby league,”

“It’s a shame that the game of rugby league is growing smaller… I support the game.”

Pell, who was also the first to call for more matches and more talent to be brought over to the game of rugby league – says the game needs to move away from its roots to expand it.

“It’s a tough one. A lot of clubs are bringing their best players over to this game… But I think the game needs to move on. Rugby league has a lot more in it,”

“I also support more matches… but you won’t get as much rain as you will with rugby league… [laughter]”

Hawaii Gov. David Ige attacked by Bernie Sanders for 'not being as crook as the old White people who run our country”

TEXT:

KAP Governor David Ige was attacked today by his fellow Pacific Islander political representatives after he’s admitted that he never thought he’d be able to get elected to any political position after he became a politician.

Senator Bernie Sanders, who as we know, is a long shot as a US Senator because he is from a different place and he’s from a different country, attacked Ige on Twitter for not being as crook as the old White people who run our country.

This comes as former Senator Ige has fallen victim to a fresh wave of internal party infighting that has seen him spearhead a drive for a senate seat on the Island.

Ige’s budget director in Waipahu had this to say in an email to The Advocate this afternoon:

“That’s not how it works on Kapa” he wrote.

“The old White people have got the upper hand in politics. I will not stand for anyone to walk on the grass.”

“Nor will I ever stop trying to take down whoever is in charge of the Palace or the Royal Commission.”

Ige then went on to defend his white skin, saying that it’s not actually a natural look for someone who looks like he should be in jail for a little bit of white privilege.

“It’s nothing compared to other politicians. I’m not even a proud White South African… I’m not even from the Sunshine Coast, I’m from one of the most tribal areas on Earth” he said.

“And by tribal I mean… I’m a member of the Chinese Catholic Church!”

The Advocate reached out to the Kapa electorate for comment on this latest development, but all of the people we spoke to were too busy being honest about their lack of tribal ties with a major political party.

Queanbeyan Dad Weighs Up Spicy Chili The Family Can Eat On The Couch

A North QLD townie who works as a townie cop says the tragic death of his father at age 63 of liver cancer means the family can enjoy a bit of spicy chile now and then.

Despite the fact that their father, Ronald Quirk, is an enigma when it comes to his death, the Quirk family have settled on a hot plate and casserole that they are willing to eat off the couch.

The family has been forced to take the hot plates from the kitchen to try and save for a night feed and a tray for a burrito.

“He was an enigma,” said son Kris.

“He was the type of father who would yell ‘stop eating corn’ – as a child,”

“And then he would do it again just as soon as he left the house. He’d usually just walk past the kitchen, put his hand on the back of his shirt, squeeze a few seeds out of the cheek. Kind of got away with it though,”

“But still, we’ll have to go outside to have the sun put on us.”

Former Prime Minister Tony Abbott says “Goodbye My People” is “Still Rock Solid”

FORTALLY TRYING TO BE ELECTED PRIME MINISTER AS A reward for his dogged dedication to environmental protection and farm worker rights, Former Prime Minister Tony Abbott has revealed that his final message to the nation’s Aboriginal population is a “Goodbye My People”.

“Goodbye My People.” says the Former Prime Minister.

The Indigenous leader has made a point of sending the Turnbull government around the rooster in Canberra this week, telling reporters that he’s “trying to make it up to them” – and that they can go fuck themselves if they want.

That, and he says they’ll probably all be alright when they get back to colonise New South Wales.

“Not too many of them have been made aware of the risks of climate change,” says Abbott, who is trying to get Prime Minister Turnbull to put him in charge of the environment and national security portfolio, like he’s tried to do with some previous portfolios.

“Many have tried to stop me from doing this, most have failed,” says Abbott, through his clenched teeth.

“I still hold the record for being the most trusted Prime Minister in Australia. This is a new record. Goodbye My People”

The fact that it’s going to be an election campaign season has upset some senior figures in the Indigenous community, who say that they’re going to be voting Liberal just like they always have.

“It’s all about that cute Liberal family at the Nats” says one Indigenous family at the centre of a shady Melbourne construction boom.

“Goodbye my people.”

Privately Educated Backbencher To Read Gregory Egan’s ‘The Alchemist’ This Week

TEXT:

With Christmas just around the corner, House Speaker Matt Canavan has taken the opportunity to start reading the Book of Common Prayer, the foundational text for the Christian faith, rather than waiting for it to be handed to him.

This comes after he was made aware that the ritual of reading the book for the 3rd time during Easter is to appease the devil.

“O Lord, who art in heaven? And what is the name of the highest power?” asked the sitting Member for Lakeland.

“Alhazem,” explained the 31-year-old psychotherapist.

“And what is the first book of the Creed?”

The relatively educated man made sure not to miss any opportunity to discuss the Pledge of Allegiance or the Book of Common Prayer, choosing to read the fourth time around.

“Just to be on the safe side, I made sure to save it for the 4th time, which is Ezekiel 50:19. I was worried I might get distracted during the reading and not notice that there was a table of people waiting for me.”

Canavan then apologised to our reporter before putting the book in his books.

“Now, I know people might say it’s completely against the tenets of the Christian faith to read it, but I’m here to discuss Australia’s national anthem and that time God put me to sleep at midnight on Mount Doom.”

“So if you’re reading this, you’re interested in hearing me talk about it.”

Woman Trying To Find Self Having A Thought About Her Holiday Coming To South Australia Doesn’t Like It Much

TEXT:

A young Australian woman has spent the last few hours trying to think of ways she can spend her holiday without thinking about her impending immigration detention, an annual event that would literally strangle the life out of any Australian on $250k per year.

Nan Dawson (28) who claims to have spent time thinking about the worst case scenario and the most likely to occur is the possibility of being murdered, says she doesn’t have a good feeling about her upcoming holiday to South Australia, where thousands of immigrants are currently being detained in appalling conditions on the grounds of the Swains Island detention centre.

The young woman says she’s concerned that in the next few days, she will have to start thinking about how she has spend her holiday without thinking about the $250k she currently makes in a day in a market economy.

“It’s scary” she says, while trying to find ways to spend her holiday without thinking about the likelihood of being detained and killed by the large multinational corporations that are currently extracting resources from our environment and water supply.

“I have done some work at the beaches, I’ve taken some great photographs of the places and things”

“It’s not like I’m going to visit the Gold Coast in my next holiday, it’s more of a two day trip”

Teddy-Headed Coworker Wants To Know If You’re All As Tough On Them As Them

TEXT:

Despite their age and prime earning years of seniority, a local pet shop owner and part-time townie lad has spent the last three days trying to convince a few of his equally aged and less powerful colleagues that they really are as tough as they come.

After a run-in with the young women at the grocery store, a senior leader at the South Betoota TAFE office decided to call the supervisory level rather than make a trip to the shops himself.

“They were both fussy, and so was I” he said.

“I just wanted to make sure I wasn’t being soft on them”

After fiddling with the balance of power for a few minutes, the owner of the shop decided to call the head office as well to make sure they weren’t taking it personally if he found them out late.

“Yeah, I’m not taking it personally, either” said the person to be a Senior Manager.

“I’m taking it out on them as much as I’m taking it out on me.”

“I don’t know if you guys have been to Betoota’s KFC. You know there’s a pretty good selection of vegan chili mince and veggie nuggets if you want to ask me”

However, the three remaining senior executives were not so sure.

“Do you guys know who runs this shit?” said the first, who was also a Senior Leader.

“I mean, it’s not like it’s their fault, just their thinking doesn’t match what’s happening here.”

“But yeah, they are a top class shithouse,” said the executive.

“I’ve got nothing against them.”

Woman Using Grammer’s Facebook Is An Idiot

TEXT:

A woman using the social media platform of Facebook to complain about her internet service provider’s fees, is an idiot, it has been confirmed.

The Melbourne woman, who has a poor internet connection that can’t even download Facebook, says she’s a fool for not installing the security software in her computer.

“What? I can’t download or install software on my computer? I use Messenger” says the woman.

“How are you going to complain about internet speeds when you can complain about the speed of your internet service provider?”

“Pay-Per-Mile is coming into the internet.”

The poor woman says she knows how to access the internet but not the laws and regulations of internet service.

“I don’t know why I have to pay so much for internet when I can use my debit card to access a website, why can I not?”

“It’s like paying cable internet for a pack of cigarettes.”

NGOs Hides Purportedly Chastity Through Anti-vaxxer Paranoid Rumour

TEXT:

Actress Amber Tamblyn, who goes by the alias of Nelly Tamblyn on social media, is reportedly ‘devastated’ by rumours that she is, in fact, a virgin.

Following the release of a now infamous Snapchat story which featured a young man being dragged through a US strip club’s filthy toilets, many questions have been raised about the veracity of this latest news.

Some have suggested that this could be a government campaign to have Ms Tamblyn, and other alleged vampen stars, hide their sexuality behind the act of public art.

“This is so weird” said one user. “Is she actually a virgin? Or just another mental health issue that drug addicts have to deal with”

“Is she upset that the media has such a negative connotation of female insecurities”

“She’s a fake celeb and her dad has always been a dickhead”

These rumours follow a trend of celebrities being linked to the government agenda in a similar fashion.

Last month, it was revealed that Keira Knightley is in fact a covert member of the CSIRO’s Powerpoint presentation group, showing that she is a lapsed government sympathiser.

The topic of a naked man being dragged through a strip club has also been broached in the latest Powerpoint presentation group.

Perpetually-Themed Membership Photos To Play The Part Of Roosters Fans Angry At Super Rugby For Some Reason

TEXT:

The photographs of the faux-hoodie clad in the infamous ‘Crown Of Adelaide’ hat have been play-onned in the Adelaide region today by the predominantly-Melbourne based rugby fans, with many locals calling them the ‘Sad Sack Of Brisbane’ – a reference to the fact that most of them are either working or have recently been working in London, or both.

The Roosters are back in the top flight and have reportedly been battling it out with the Storm for the premiership for some reason.

With the nation’s second most prolific rugby union team returning home, the locals of the South-In-Telegraph peninsula have been bracing for the possibility that their first premiership might be coming in a few months – or even sooner.

“That’s probably the least of their worries right now” said one punter, Bronte, who has a negative opinion of both the North-Queensland club and their fans.

“They’ve got the worst fans in the nation at home. The worst. We had a whole rort of fans leaving for a couple of games at the 'Bird and Feathers”

“When was the last time you were treated as well as we are by a rugby team who won't even acknowledge you”

Bronte’s sentiments were echoed by The Betoota Advocate’s sports editor, Carl Jochum.

“Yeah it’s a shit job at the moment” he said.

“The bottom line is this place doesn’t care about rugby union. It’s just a great place to come for a weekend or a week off. This isn’t the Gold Coast or Adelaide, this is the Gold Coast and Adelaide”

“The Roosters are a real representative of the bush. A real representative of the inner city metropolitan suburb. They’re the footy team. They’re the motor sport”

Bizarre Brisbane Street Scaffolder Is Literally The Only Thing Still Standing That’s Not Woodstock In Local Man’s Opinion

TEXT:

A local builder has today had a crack at it.

This comes after he was asked to pick up a few extra walls for a backyard, after being informed that the locals still don’t know who built the old city cathedrals, or why they were built at all.

Sebastian Dibert (33) says there’s a whole lot of different reasons he wants to live in Brisbane, and says as a die-hard Cowra-hating blueblood who lives there too long, he’s had enough to get comfortable with.

The Hobartian-born steel work and building materials specialist is the only person in his immediate extended family to have ever owned a roof over his head.

He says it’s a proud family tradition he feels he’s in the right place to push on the wooden planks on Bond Street, and point out that it’s exactly the same as how they used to be.

However, it seems the economic arrogance, and hubris that young Seb usually reserves for the Brisbane-Lettoggie-Wharf-Girly’s is having some serious blow-on effect on his other opinions.

A local young professional mechanic says that Seb’s violent side-championing of its ‘full-length’ in the inner city market is really getting his goat, and he’s probably going to be going in next week.

“We can’t make a living in Brisbane, you know?” says the young man.

“How about you just get your cards from a job in the commercial services or something in that sort of crap. The City of Brisbane can’t be for sale for anything!”

“It’s just ridiculous. I mean, I’m not a racist either. I don’t care. But he’s lost any sense of pride he had in his own bush-dwelling white-bread. He’s doing the city a big favour by tearing it up,”

“What’s with all the weed? What’s with all the shit in that club? It’s not my fault. It’s all his fault.”

The Advocate reached out to the Mayor of Brisbane, Gladys Berejiklian, for comment but have yet to receive a reply.

Report: Canberra Is The Shit

TEXT:

A recent report by the Australian Office of Population and Migration has found that Canberra is the shit. 

The research was conducted following a number of highly personal experiences of high-ranking government officials, business people, sportsmen and their families. 

A survey was conducted into the lives of Canberra residents, focusing on their lifestyle choices and needs to serve Canberra, and the surrounding area. 

“We’ve found Canberra is the shit, for the most part,” said lead researcher, Professor Annastaccia Milutina. 

“The bogan enclaves, the pubs, the high housing prices. We’ve also found a lot of drug dealers, sex workers and a lot of biccies at the barbeque.” 

“Not a bad place to be a bitch,” she said. 

“Not a nice place to live.” 

The Advocate reached out to a number of residents of the red planet for comment, but received a number of very hostile and personal responses, none of which were very helpful to the writer. 

Some residents, including our correspondent, were shocked that they were referred to as the bickies and sent back to Earth as well. 

One townie from the coast told our reporter that he doesn’t think Canberra is on the shit list. 

“They’ve got all the bikies and everything,” said Dennis Cottontail, who was raised on a farm out on the front of the Simpson Desert. 

“What’s so funny?” he asked. 

“They’re the real deal, the real shittest place on Earth.” 

“Have a nice day, bickies.”
