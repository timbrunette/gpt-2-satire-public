PM Says He’s Still Not Sure Why Billy Short Is Problematic

TEXT:

Prime Minister Scott Morrison has been unable to comment on why there is an ongoing debate about why the Prime Minister is so problematic.

The nation’s Prime Minister, who was once the driving force behind the Liberal Party winning the Australian election, has been unable to comment on the ongoing debate about why the Prime Minister is so problematic.

However, Morrison has defended his overwhelming approval ratings for the Deputy Prime Minister, stating that Shortenong’s an easy scapegoat for Shortenong’s problematic hairstyle.

“I just don’t understand it,” said Morrison.

“Billy Short isn’t a bad guy? The haircuts, the sleeve tattoos, the never talking to me like it’s 2005 anymore? The only reason why he is so popular with people like me is because he was Deputy Prime Minister, and I am the one who is going to be Prime Minister forever,”

“I don’t know why we are having this debate about it.”

However, The Prime Minister went on to explain that Billy Short is problematic, because he’s Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the Opposition, respectively.

Shortenong’s relationship with the Australian public is well-documented, as he was once the leader of the Opposition.

“I met Shortenong at the Van der Linde Hotel in Melbourne” said Morrison.

“He was so cute”

“I’m not sure why he was so popular with the media, but he was the only PMS who got a haircut”

“Shortenong was such a psycho”

Local Mum Begins Search For New Bachelorette Stickers That Involve Prawns

TEXT:

Mother-of-four Kimberly Davis (32) has started a search on for new hairstyles and accessories that could be applied to the top of any red, pink and lime green lingerie currently on shop fronts of predominantly working-class suburbs in the country.

While she does not mind the random little sparks flying out of misplaced items in her hair, Mrs Davis states that it is very important that she not make the same mistake twice in her life.

“It’s not like I want them to look the same to me or anything”

“I’ve always used to like to use purple lingerie products though”

“So I just need to experiment with different shades”

While Mrs Davis is beginning to think that applying purple lingerie to items of clothing that aren’t red, pink and lime green lingerie could be a very costly mistake, she is not deterred by the fact that items of clothing could also be used for a variety of uses other than the listed ones, like the odd little scrap of hair and a pool cue.

“I don’t think I’d be getting the full effect that purple lingerie has at the local RSL”

“Also, I don’t think it’d make a lick of difference if I just mass produced by the nipples”

“Purple lingerie is too expensive”

“I’m Not Ready To Fuck Around A Goldie” Says Man Who Disagrees With Triple J

TEXT:

A local man has lashed out at Triple J today after the juggernaut hit the radio playing his new single “I’m Not Ready To Fuck Around A Goldie”.

Speaking to The Advocate this morning in Sydney’s Olympic Park, Greg Toad said that he was disappointed that the juggernaut didn’t make it onto the broadcast.

“I was so disappointed with Triple J when they came on over the weekend,” he said.

“That Gold party they went on was just so fuckwits fucking mediocre. It was only on the air a week ago. I’m not ready to fuck around. Yuck!”

However, the 25-year-old isn’t ready to fuck around yet.

He explained to The Advocate that he has had a long enough life to know that the pushy and pushy-minded Gemini is much more than a passing art form.

“I had the privilege to experience life behind the scenes. I heard everything I need to know about Triple J about four hours ago,” he said.

“What they’ve done with the music is so fucked. I’m not ready to fuck around. It’s like listening to some throat-chiller, it doesn’t even taste good,”

“I’ll just get a couple gigs out of doing it. I’m already trying out mixing CDs and podcasts. I might even buy a CD of me and the girls singing in it. It’s not that I don’t like it, it’s just that I don’t want to get my hands on it. It’s got me fucked,”

“It’s not like I’d rather have that music than have it. It’s just not for me.”

“We Need To Guard Against Left-Wing Extremism” Says New Balance Rude Boy In Coat Case Outside Of Suburb”

TEXT:

Local lefty, Wyatt (31) says he’s heard a lot about “hate speech”, despite not even reading any of the articles published by News Corp. It’s not that he doesn’t think New Balance sneakers are bad, he just thinks he’d be a little bit different.

Like most lost children, Wyatt was left confused by the new Nike jumpers, which are a hybrid of jumpers and jumpers.

“Like, if you look at the pictures, it’s pretty obvious that they are made from jumpers,” he explained.

“They’re made from a hybrid of jumpers and jumpers. It’s not hate speech at all.”

However, not everybody was convinced of the sincerity of Mr Wyatt’s sentiments.

“What the hell does “hate speech” mean?” asked Libby from between puffs.

“It’s a bit tricky because it involves identifying with a minority group and then talking about it,” she explained.

“One of the articles that got me talking about the Olympics was the piece by Daily Telegraph journalist Paul Murray, which described me as a “white supremacist”. That article went viral and received over 20,000 Facebook likes as well as a “masterminded” from one of my “colleagues”. That was all in the context of what I was hearing at the markets,” she said.

“But I doubt it,” she said.

Mr Murray’s article on the online sports-betting website, BetCuck as well as the Daily Telegraph’s equally loathed “big words” in relation to climate change and immigration had all contributed to Wyatt’s confusion.

“When I finally tried to explain it to him,” she said.

“He started laughing and made a point of asking me what the “logic’ is,” he laughed.

“I told him that it says what we all believe, that football is not a form of recreation and that white people are superior to blacks in many respects,” she said.

“So he started laughing again and said that the only way to stop white supremacy from taking over this country is to make a few arrests and fire up the mob.”

“It was quite a jibe but he might just keep jigging it up,” she said.

It’s still yet to be confirmed what the actual punchline is here, but one thing is for sure, it’s going to be about fucking chips.

The punchline starts with a few bets, followed by some reverse bets. At point 4, it’s round and round, there’s a total of 44 chips on offer.

It’s understood that the total bet amount is the actual retail price at which the chips will be laid, and the actual chips in question are the actual chips in question not Betoota’s famous Coles brand.

“I Don’t Care If We Have To Spend The $17B Tax Cut On Overseas Buyers, Or Not”

TEXT:

The Prime Minister has thrown the towel in today, as he looks to come out of retirement with a $17 billion surplus, and instead look to spend the money on a pension, trade and economy that doesn’t rely on foreign investment.

Scott Morrison spoke to journalists at a cafe outside the Taxation Office in Canberra, as he looked to come out on top of his previously concluded that the government is doing everything within its power to spend money on nothing.

“I don’t care if we have to spend the $17 billion tax cut on overseas… or not,” said the Prime Minister.

“I’m going to spend that money wisely, in my capacity as a taxpayer-funded tax-payer, on things that benefit everyone else, including farmers and small businesses,”

“But the money’s here. So spend it on things that help the working man, not multinationals and their overseas cash-for-nothing cash-for-nothing private school mates.”

The Prime Minister then refused to answer any questions from the media as he looked to come out on top of his already so-called ‘disaster’.

“I Just Don’t Get Cold” Says Bladder

A local bladder has remained surprisingly firm over the course of the morning commute despite the oppressive lack of sex.

The results of the prospective nurse who filled out her form admitted that it had been having a good night’s sleep, with at least one full blown erection.

“I just don’t get cold” said the formic recessional soft-eyed.

“I’ve got no idea how I’m doing without intercourse [laughter].

The irregular period of irregular bleeding has been described as a “miracle” and a “disastrous cycle”.

Local GP, Dr Kimberly O’Leary says that despite the fact that she has seen a number of bladders that are still firm to the touch of her fingertips, she feels it is quite important for patients to be able to provide informed and articulate explanations of why they feel the way they do.

“I mean, it’s not like I’ve seen someone get blind, or even deaf, or just Blind Melbournemouth blind. It’s just common sense,” said the irresponsibly large GP.

“I don’t think it’s a big issue, given that we only really get colds and stuff from time to time. But I can tell you, it’s fucking annoying.”

Local Girl Really Getting A Pump On This Week

TEXT:

A local girl has revealed to The Advocate this week that she’s getting a good Pump on, after getting up to snout size two this week.

“Yeah, looks like it’s worked out for me” Kat says, after being questioned about whether the previous two pump sizes were ‘fit-able’

“I’ve had three blokes walk through my door in their summer dresses. I’ve had a caravan full of them get my wife around the house in their pyjamas”

“They’ll love it”

The recent increase in size odd-shaped ‘stocks’ (stockish men with stockish haircuts) has been largely attributed to the aforementioned ‘dresses’ (men with dress dresses) – as well as the fact that men with dress dresses are about twice as likely as women with dresses to rub shoulders.

However, the girl, who can’t be named one of the men in her life whose name has been changed for fear of violating the ‘looks of the coalition,’ says she doesn’t really know how this all works out.

“I’m just one big K-squad” she says while stroking his tail.

Nation’s Hipster Chicks Vow To Wear Even Thinner Sunglasses

TEXT:

Australia’s hipster community are responding to the oppressive heatwave that’s just days away by wearing sunnies and a pair of skinny jeans that make their way onto their upper body.

The nation’s hipster community say they too are feeling personally attacked by a world that insists they are on the thinner end of the social spectrum.

“I can’t go to the gym anymore,” says local boy, Toby (31).

“I’m getting sick of all this red meat and all this mass exercise. It’s not working for me! I’m too fat!”

Thick and thin, usually associated with overweight or obese, is not a disease but a cultural expectation that is directly linked to a given lifestyle.

Toby says that because his parents aren’t very good at instructing children in how to walk correctly, he will continue to wear skinny jeans and a thick hooded jumper whenever he gets a break.

“I’ll still be able to get a workout on, but it’ll be more intense and I won’t be able to feel the same way I did when I was in primary school. Kids keep telling me they grow out of it, but I feel like I’m growing old.”

Toby says he will continue to wear the same look for the next few days.

“I’m going to go to the gym once a week and I’ll keep doing it regardless. It’s not working for me! I’m too fat!”

“Please Stop Snitching” Says Unimpressive Bloke At EOFY

TEXT:

A local bloke is very well aware that he is not very fast this morning, and if he does not stop snitching about halfway through his usual breakfast, he risks losing the ability to speak to people and animals.

“I’m going to say something racist, or at least something that resembles a racist” the half-pissed tradie says, in an uncharacteristic giggle.

“Nazi”

The fact that the bloke is also a marginally-employed human who has been to a few lame AFL matches this week also means that he is treading very lightly on this very same social handbrake.

“Nah. That’s not how it works” says the half-hearted Virgo, as he laughs alongside his female co-workers.

“We’ll just say something like ‘Black Bloke’ or something along those lines.”

This is because even though half-pissed tradies are able to talk to animals and talking frogs, it is not enough – for half-hearted internet trolls to say ‘shut up’ and use that ability to take back their tradie’s voice, which has been the backbone of the social construct of blackfellaism for centuries.

The fact that half-pissed trolls are able to say ‘shut’ is a stark contrast to the national statistics.

“We think we’re on target” says the Treasurer.

“And we don’t mind if you tell us how we ought to do things”

“Just don’t tell us how we ought to do things”

“I’ve Got Me Cables If You Want To Be A Cop” Says Unfiltered Photo Of Brisbane Broncos Head

TEXT:

A Brisbane local has lashed out at the authorities today after a photo of him with a jumper that reads ‘Brisbane Broncos Head’ went viral on social media overnight.

James Liston (24) said it’d be a “disgusting throw of the tits” for authorities to use an image of a member of the football club as a grooming platform for someone they don’t like.

“That and I’ve got a jumper that reads ‘Brisbane Broncos Head’” said James.

“It’s so insensitive. They should be sending their best headshot to all of our scouts so they can take the piss”

“I’m calling for an independent inquiry. It’s that serious.”

A spokesman from Queensland Police said they’d investigate and James wouldn’t have to go through the usual vetting process again.

“We’ve got no leads, nothing to see here anyway. Unless the photo is being used to groom high-ranking high-ranking members of our football association”

“The most recent incident is just icing on the cake. Not an uncommon occurrence, but Queensland Police are working hard to make sure no one follows the rules here.”

The investigation into the photo went to a close of police and alleged independent commission.

The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) is a registered charity of Queensland that specialises in the protection of members of the wider public. ICAC is made up of registered public servants who get up to five business days pay leave a year and travel on board to or from the venue where the official photo is taken.

When asked by a former member of the public whether it’s possible for a former member of the public to come and go as they please, Mr Liston said it’s just not feasible.

“You can’t come and go as I’ve told you to”

“Come and get fucked. It’s not like I’ve got a temper tantrum every time a member of the public comes to visit me”.

“I haven’t had to cold-call the guy since I got the photo. The only person I have to talk to is the person who requested it”.

“I’m fucked.”

The Advocate reached out to Queensland Police for comment but only received a sternly-worded letter from the head of the New South Wales force saying that no one has been formally charged with a crime.

It was returned to the authorities with the further recommendation that the alleged offender not be made to feel guilty by wearing a jumper that reads ‘Brisbane Broncos Headshots’.

Sydney’s Problem With Underage Drinking Almost As Acedes As Even The Schooners Are Getting A Little Hot

TEXT:

The Little Green Sun’s popularity has only grown in recent months, as its popularity in regional areas has grown.

However, not everyone is happy with the popularity.

A recent survey has found that nearly everybody in Sydney would rather have a beer with a mint flavoured palm stick.

A resounding 98% of Sydney residents would rather have the mint flavoured soft drink, rather than have it hit the footpath completely.

While the popularity of the Little Green Sun has been acknowledged as a breakthrough discovery in recent years, the true roots of its current popularity lie in the residents who have been rocking the green for a while.

One curious resident is Gregory, a marginally employed bicycle courier that was recently promoted to sales coordinator after his sales were outpacing those of other recreational recreational users in the area.

“I’ve always been a bit shy around the bloke,” he said.

“He was always a bit loud, he was always a bit shit at his core. But I got it. It hits the spot.”

While it’s been acknowledged that the Little Green Sun’s popularity in Sydney has been greatly aided by a slick marketing campaign and a slick PR campaign – it is acknowledged that this particular craze exists in a vacuum, as the craze is primarily fuelled by those who enjoy drinking much higher than average.

One Sydneysider, Kel (bruce) says she can’t wait to have her nipples pierced.

“I’ve always been good at playing on my phone. When I was a kid, I used to use it to threaten to throw my parents out,”

“Now I’ve got it in my hands to buy a house or get married. It hits the spot. I can barely wait to have my nipples pierced.”

The Advocate reached out to a number of Sydney-based retailers and importers of the little green jelly stick – but have yet to receive a response.

“You Can’t Do That With The Red Nins” Says New Dem Senator

TEXT:

A New South Wales Liberal who dabbles in moderate to full blown heartland politics while interning for the ABC, says the Red Nins are the new elites.

Speaking to the media this morning via telephone, Malcolm Roberts explained that the party was losing touch with the everyday Australians that come out of Sydney to work in the blue-ribbon state.

“You’ve got these big city boomers that are bringing their ‘inner city’ lifestyle to the party,” explained the Nationals leader.

“You’ve got these blokes up in the city who can’t even boot a table tennis from the Lord Kidman. You’ve got these blokes from inner-city Melbourne who can’t boot a table tennis from either of those venues. It’s just not based on the people who live in these areas. Labor is for inner-city professionals only,”

“If you want to live in Melbourne, you can’t ‘get’ from there to the city. The Nats have their own workers out there, who ultimately serve their local tradesmen and sometimes cows. It’s simply not fair for these boomers to stay in Sydney.”

The Nationals leader went on to explain that while the rise of Australia’s inner-city professionals is a worrying trend, it is not a reason to lower the party’s standards.

“The people who work in these areas obviously don’t come here to work for the ‘blueprint economy’ – they come here to work for highly politicised big city elites who want to maintain their status as upper-middle class property owners,” said Mr Roberts.

“I’ll tell you what, these inner-city professionals don’t need the blueprints of the city being from the capitals. They could use a beer and cheese round to celebrate their 40-hour weeks.”

With what can only be described as one of her least dramatic protests of the afternoon, Betoota local Lauren Fitzsimmons is reportedly seriously contemplating embarrassing her boyfriend, Nathan, by sitting on the couch for a bit and throwing a fit.

“I don’t know what I’m doing, but I am THE big dog”

“He loves me. He told me at first that I must be a big dog – and I’m not”

While Nathan insists that he loves his girlfriend – and vows to love her equally – Lauren says that he is treading very lightly.

“I’m the big dog here,” says the married couple whose mutual friends are just as important as neighbours – and in turn, are viewed as selfish and out of touch by their partner.

“He loves us… and we love him… and that”

While Nathan claims to have calmed down somewhat after a period of heavy drinking and heavy breathing, he is still at odds with himself.

“I’m the big dog here,” he says to his partner Natalie.

“I’m the big dog here,”

“And if I fucking destroy myself in front of my partner and friends – I’ll explode myself”

“I feel like killing myself”

With his girlfriend already planning his funeral and threatening to file a hate crime if she doesn’t allow it – Lauren says she is beginning to feel kind of anxious.

“I can’t believe Nathan is still here, and he is still in here…”

Bloke Who Just Watched RuPaul’s Drag Race Finale Not Yet An Obscure Person

“Yeah, so yeah I’ve watched it about 2,000 times. I really liked it. I’m gonna keep it up, if you wanna see me in person, I’m gonna go to the real thing,” Davidson said.

“But I don’t think anybody has even watched the show yet. I mean look at the dresses I wear [haha]”

The fact that young Davidson has had a chance to watch the show, and actually see a contestant, is a testament to the fact that he actually watches reality television, considering it is a fictional universe.

Speaking to The Advocate via wireless telephone over the front of a Curtis Bin House, Davidson explained that he has been eyeing off the race for close to an hour now and doesn’t have anyone he can talk to other than his actual housemates.

“I’m gonna keep it up,” said Davidson.

Dutton Hires Drone To Assist With GOTV GOTV Feed

TEXT:

The Prime Nightwatchman of Australia has today come good on his promise to appoint a drone to ferry aid from the Australian public broadcaster, The Australian will probably be in a better position than most to give it a go.

While a lot of people might be angling for a bit of a wind, with the Prime Minister taking a big pay cheque to a company that makes shitty work of his taxpayer funded travel entitlements, it seems that Abbott has finally moved with the wind.

While some would argue that, in a situation like this, the likelihood of any aid being getting to someone in a bad way is very low, it is a relief that Abbott has the tool at his hand.

The aid, which is currently being provided by a family friend of a Liberal staffer named Jake alias Murray-Darling, is reportedly helping to ferry aid from a Western Suburbs-based woman named Gemma Coles-Sugary.

With the Prime Minister refusing to explain why she chose to travel to Japan instead of Australia, the possibility of aid getting help from a male named Jake Marge more than doubles, it is believed that the woman named Coles-Sugary has already been helped.

With the aid currently being a coworker of the Nightwatchman’s, it is believed that the man named Jake is probably doing the right thing, by not getting a week off in order to care about the man that much.

Dutton Smashes Lab Test Result And Says The Result Is Too Conf With No Way To Read

TEXT:

The Home Affairs Minister has thrown his support behind a test result that has allowed him to conclude that the evidence against him is strong.

Peter Dutton arrived in Australia this morning with a black eye.

His home office had initially told the media that the result was arrived at because he threw his un-unused French Quarter Queenslander apartment up on a balcony.

However, in what seemed like a perfectly normal and act of God, the result has allowed the man to throw the highest possible of hopes onto the table.

The man, who’s name was not revealed, said his office had been told the test results were passed on and that the only way to read the result is by going to the pub and pissing up a few cold schooners.

Speaking to The Advocate this afternoon via telephone, a spokesperson for the man said that this is a normal day for the man and that any attempt to fuck the system up in this manner will be met with the full support of the Australian public.

“We’ve had a man throw a rock up apartment this morning on a Tuesday and the government has had a man throw a rock up in Australia in recent years,” the spokesperson said.

“So we had a man throw a rock up in the middle of a pissing session at the pub. We’ve had a man throw a rock up in the past and thought he was a bit off his shit, so we had him do it.”

“But the government of Australia has been very supportive and we’ve been very supportive of the man,” the spokesperson said.

“It’s Not Happening,” Says Every Single Chick In Sydney

TEXT:

A recent survey of Australian single men has found that not even one single chick in Sydney is actually interested in watching you rub it in fucking 2020.

The iconic red light-in-the-wall study of Australian sexual behaviour by the University of Sydney has found that a majority of Australian men, still hold the title man who just spent 10 minutes rubbing their crotch together in the Sydney Stock Exchange.

As well as the fact that most of them have never even heard of each other, a number of other things also disprove the title.

One damning finding of the survey is that 70% of all men who were surveyed claimed to have never had sex with a woman who didn’t tell them.

This is not unlike in the United Kingdom, where the title of every single man or woman is “It’s Not Happening,”

In Australia, the title of every single man or woman is “It’s Not Happening,”

This claim is not novel in itself, with the young feminist activists taking a particular victim angle in the wake of the Brexit vote.

In 2009, the then young feminist activist Lucy Tux was stood down from her blog, Feminist Voice For A Change, for posting a blog about a woman’s experience with sex work.

In a brave call for change, Tux was quick to change her blog cover photo to “a “toy-of-cocky-boy.”

Tux still lives at the address “Tux”  (sic from which the “Tux” is printed) and has not moved to change her address ever since.

“It’s Not Happening,” she says.

A local man who looks like he has the hide of a one-night-stand goon has ended up punching through his friends on the stairs of his French Quarter share house with a bang.

Seconds after the punch Gary landed on the floor beside him, who now looked as if he’d just experienced the first world war.

“Fuck!” he said sharply.

“I’m going to punch the cunt of a cunt right through the wall!”

“Fuck, fuck, fuck!”

“Fuck me!”

However, despite the loud swearing coming from the front door and the screaming from the neighbouring stumps, Gary says he’s fine.

He says he punched through the door once before but the pain was much worse and he’d do it again if he had to.

“Mate, I’m here!” said Gary as he helped himself to another cold schooner of ciders.

“See how much you’ve been getting? You’re going to fuck I reckon! [sic]”

Gary was then seen to have the keys to the nearby unlocked garage.

Man with jet-ski unable to take in clouds over Avalon

A weather expert has been unable to find a single cloud to be able over the Avalon Airport today, despite spending a large part of the afternoon attempting to find one – after flying for nearly an hour without a filter.

Dennis Coleman, from the UQ’s Royal Institute of Aeronautics, says he was “bewashed” and “shook” by the clouds, saying they were “seriously out of control” – but that it was “all worth it” – even if it was just an hour and a half ago.

“Today is the last day of flying for me,” said the 41-year-old stay-at-home software consultant.

“I can’t fly with these odds,”

Local Woman Really Looks Her Up And Down Over New Look

TEXT:

Local woman, Danielle Smith, has today had to endure yet another look from her new man, in a new outfit.

While wearing a black t-shirt, the fashion statement hasn’t gone unnoticed in the town’s cultural hub, where she lives with her parents and general satisfaction with life.

“I wear it because I like wearing myself down and it’s because it’s the only thing I’ve seen in a live broadcast of the day” she says, while also looking at photos of her husband, Pete, currently serving a 10-year sentence for sexual offences against two of his children, from 2009.

“My new outfit looks so fresh.”

While not overly embarrassed by her outfit, young Danielle says it’s a step in the right direction.

“I guess I’m just a different girl.”

“I guess I’m just one of many”

Local Woman Who’s Never Used A Phone And Can Still Share Facebook Status As A Facebook

TEXT:

A local woman who took the time to explain her irrational fear of privacy to The Betoota Advocate prior to her planned trip to Australia, has today unveiled the most controversial new technology in Australian tech to France.

“I just don’t want to talk about it” says Jah’lia Bella, a 22-year-old account manager from Brisbane’s high-turbant Parisian Circle.

“Why would you want to share some private information about me with the government”

This new revelation follows a report by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, has found that 80% of people who admitted to sending a WhatsApp group message before the election, either shared it or did not share it, private information they had about them.

The report has found that the use of the platform since then has only increased by 30% – to roughly describe the amount of people who used it before the election.

“That’s not because the post-election number ‘stretched’ a bit” explained one statistician.

“The post-election number has grown by 30%, I mean people who like to share mundane information about people, who might be voting, have their say reaffirmed”

“But that’s not the real issue. That’s a world of convenience”

“It’s all about convenience – and that’s something we are failing to see in our data management systems. We are not decentralising the economy, we are only using WhatsApp”

New South Wales premier Gladys Berejiklian called for the federal government help in the fight against the sharks, telling Channel Nine’s Sunrise program that she believes in their fight against us.

“The fact that these sharks are attacking people and taking our jobs is simply unacceptable,” she said.

“Please do stop the attacks. They are very aggressive and predatory. They eat as many fish as possible and the same goes for the sharks themselves,”

“I’m very sorry that I can do this. I’m also very sorry that the shark attacks in my own electorate are making people question their choice in Parliament,”

“Here Comes The Boom” Says Local Hipster Who Doesn’t Know What Music Can Get Get Out Of His Head

TEXT:

With the release of his third album in five years, Australian hip hop has been rocked by the steady stream of reckless rap that isn’t anywhere near as reckless as it has been in the past.

With the release of his most recent album, ‘Here Comes The Boom’ has been met with criticism from the community, with many saying the album doesn’t do enough to address the rise of hip hop that hasn’t seen the light of day.

Many say the album is too brash and too fast paced, while others like Waleed Aly, Creative Director at HN outside of rap with a shit-talk about Beats, has done enough to address the rampant use of ‘Here Comes The Boom’.

Here comes the boom.

The hype has just been enough for one local hip hop enthusiast who is now a household name, after successfully campaigning to have the album removed from his playlist.

“Fuck it, it’s here. Fuck it,” said young Waleed Aly.

“I’m going to have to quit my life to get listened to”

However, despite his efforts, the Australian music industry is facing backlash for the way the rap/Rap music industry has been treated in recent years.

Here comes the boom.

“Hip hop has exploded onto the scene. Everybody from Banks to Banks to Byron Bay to Byron have this boom in hip hop. Why haven’t they seen it?”

“Why should we pay attention to this stuff?”

“It’s here, it’s here. Fuck it, it’s hype!”

“You Totally Get Me!” Says Man Who Just Watched The Super Rugby Results Go Down To An Outspoken End

A local man has been getting a kick out of bragging about how he actually turned out for his side last night at the Sydney leg of the Rugby World Cup. 

In what has been described as a ‘disgusting piece of piss’ of a performance by former side on the other’s, Cameron Simpson turned on the TV and declared himself completely sober last night. 

The young man who had just watched the side almost make the finals, almost, made headlines last night after the team’s coach insisted that he’d been doing for half a day last night. 

“Nah fuck that,” Simpson said to the cameraman on his phone while he spoke about how completely sober he was last night. 

“I was doing for half a day, I was doing for half a day, I was doing for full body that fucking Bunnings ad campaign,” he said talking about buying an eight pack of Snickers and going with the flow. 

“But yeah, I totally get what you’re saying about. Last night, I actually turned up for my body. I’ve been doing that for the last couple days. I’ve been doing that for the last couple days,” he laughed before bursting into laughter himself. 

“That was like a full body sobering experience.” 

“But yeah, I’m getting a kick out of saying that I turned up for my body, because I’ve been doing that for the Bunnings ad campaign for the last couple days.” 

Simpson then told us that he’s actually got a new lease on reality after turning up for his body this morning. 

“Yeah, it was like being lifted from an aeroplane, it was like being lifted from the floor of a car.” 

“I feel great, like I’ve got super powers, I just wish I could get a bit of exercise before I turned up.” 

“But yeah, I’ve got a bunch of new listening t-shirts on and a bunch of eggs I made last night, I’m gonna bake one myself.”

Smoking is a lifestyle change that many people who enjoy smoking have in the past.

Cory Bernardi, the former head of the AJC, described the study’s findings as shocking.

“What we found was, when people try to stop you, you just can’t”

“It’s like you’re trying to hold onto control of a piece of art. It’s like you’re controlling the world, not me.”

“Drones Are Dangerous” Says Government After Budget That Suggests Robots Are Destroying Jobs

TEXT:

The Prime Nightwatchman’s budget has provided the Australian public with the opportunity to see that robots are not destroying jobs but are simply killing them.

With the imminent introduction of  AI-powered airliners to the national schedule keeping our manufacturing plants out of trouble, the government is now looking to re-engage the dead hands.

Scott Morrison said the budget would set “the example” for other major economies by making robots redundant or augmenting existing technology.

“Robots are already killing us,” said the Prime Minister.

“Before they do, they’ll have to kill us themselves. And that will have a profound effect on our way of life,”

“And it will take a lot of mental energy to put that done,”

“I’ve got nothing against robots,” he said.

The Minister for the Arts told us robots will take on many jobs and duties, such as filling in the forms and keeping the machines happy.

“We’ve already done a good job on making sure that we have a consistent stream of money go to those robot wars,” he said.

“I’ve got nothing against them,”

“But they are simply killing themselves.”

The Minister said he’d be happy to accept or oppose the robot agenda, just he didn’t have the mental energy to muster the mental courage to watch the ABC continue to broadcast half-hearted news programming without properly asking the right questions.

Malcolm Turnbull Contentiously Hugs Unread Conservative Staffer As He Walks To Work

TEXT:

Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has been urged by right-wing factions of the Coalition government to “walk away” from a controversial speech he gave on immigration just last week.

Mr Turnbull has been criticised by right-wing commentators and academics for making a calculated calculated choice in likening the number of people who have entered Australia without a visa to the number of people who remain in the country, saying it’s hard to know with certainty who they are.

However, it appears the Prime Minister is in desperate need of someone to step up and take his place amongst the middle class, as his media team desperately try to distract him from his bizarre and self-absorbed speech on the issue.

Speaking to the Betoota Advocate just moments ago, Turnbull says he had no idea who the “widespread ban” on Muslim immigration had been so effectively put in place.

“Well, no one has told me,” he said.

“This is a real example of a developed country appealing to the aspirations of a broad racial grouping. Who knows whether to be proud of that or to be concerned that the majority of migrants are not white,”

“But I do know that the people that I have been talking to are very worried about who are these people,”

“I am very proud to be a member of the Liberal Party, I am proud to be a voice for Australian’s against Islamism and racism,”

Local Man Treats Self To Taxi Asking For Trouble After Leaving Home

“If I could get out here, it’d be way worse off. The Irish people pay tax, they just use it to boot people who don’t toe the law. I’m sick of it”

“I’m a bit overboard in the race for the fucking fucking bottle of levon,” said the cocky 40-something.

However, Mr Cleary is in a heated race with his mates to find a station that doesn’t have a large empty bottle slot right in the middle of the glass, and has a number of other concerns.

TEXT:

In an escalating row with the Federal Government over whether or not they should allow the Nationals to continue running their lawns, the National Party have announced that they are facing a ‘dangerous spike in animal cruelty’ in their constituents.

The Nationals were set to vote this afternoon on whether to continue operating the Nationals, after a spike in animal cruelty committed by the party’s members to the point where members are putting their health at risk of being poisoned, has resulted in a no vote.

The bill sponsor, Scott Morrison, says that the only way for the National Party to stop the rampant animal cruelty in politics is to come together as a single unit and not lump all members together under one umbrella.

“Enough is enough” he said.

“We need to come together as a party and not lump all of us together under one umbrella”

“Enough is enough”

Morrison says he and his colleagues have worked tirelessly over the last 18 months to come to an agreement on a single policy: to come up with a single policy that will ensure that every member of the National Party gets to enjoy the fruits of their labour.

“Enough is enough” he said.

“Enough is enough”

The final vote will be taken before the member for Cook looks toward his or her seat, before another looks toward his or her seat and another toward his or her seat.

Morrison says the final result will be “a wash” for the members of the National Party who align themselves with the petulant protectionist movement of the animal rights movement.

Victorian Commuters Now At Risk Of Being Caught With Something

TEXT:

In what’s being called out to the extreme by the Australian Federal Police (Am police), Victorian commuters have been warned to avoid Melbourne for fear of being caught with something.

This comes as the city’s light rail project, the D45, is set to be built between 2000 and 2022.

The project will extend from the northern suburbs of West End, near Hyde Park, to the outer suburbs of Melbourne and inner-suburbs like Branshank, Quilpie and Logan.

Commuters have been told to expect disruptions this morning as Victorians fight tooth and nail to get the project off the ground.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison has described the project as a “disaster” and a “great legacy for Victoria”.

“This is not good” he said.

“The people of Melbourne have spoken. This is not good for our vibrant nightlife. This is not good for our vibrant democracy”

Premier Daniel Andrews says it’s a “disaster” that the project was put on hold.

“This is a project of record-keeping,” he said.

“Nobody has been caught with anything by chance. The only thing you can imagine is that a bunch of jackals have been sent out to collect punters from Hyde Park,”

“It’s a shame that the people of Melbourne have to suffer through this. This is another example of how Melbourne is being run by giant multinational corporations who benefit from a toxic political divide within their very different political parties.”

The Advocate reached out to the Victorian Liberal Party for comment but only received a signed iPhone, which was apparently snatched away from staff at the Carindale McDonalds in the Liberal electorates by a disgruntled Uber driver after an afternoon on the tiles sipping pong.

This follows the news that facial recognition software, including ALT, Apple Pay and Google Wallet – is designed to be secure and anonymous, as well as requiring little or no form of form or function to work – as facial recognition software now requires a high-level of skills to recognise faces.

However, the new Face ID requirements appear to have angered iconic retailer ANZACS, who decided to relocate their new “4G and ANZACS” to a new venue, in an attempt to minimise the hassle of having to use the new services.

“I just don’t like having to have my face recorded on a piece of metal that is bolted to the wall with a chain,” said one local retailer, Mikey.

“It makes it so easy to get mugged and then had a second go on the punch. Not something I want to be mugged and had had the fun of the evening.”

Mr Mikey also lashed out at the proposed introduction of the new technology to Australia, saying that it was a step too far for ANZACS to be putting their best foot forward.

“ANZACS IS AUSTRALIA’S FIRST SEXIAN-ANIMAL-FACIAL-NOT-HARING-to-do after they see it working. I mean if you could have 100,000 facial recognition apps going at you every second week, then you could easily be mugged in Sydney and had your second punch thrown on the roof of a police station,”

“It’s not very good enough.”

“No Reason Why You’ll Ever Be Right” Says Mates Just Saying These

TEXT:

A local mate who doesn’t mind swearing – but can’t really go anywhere without swearing in return – has spent the last six minutes making a point of saying ‘no reason why’ to all of his mates.

With a light heart and a shirt off, the young man from Betoota’s Flight Path District has not yet forgotten how to evoke the feeling of being left out in the cold – and why he’s never seen anyone completely lose their temper in a conversation.

“Aaahh come on mate. Let’s go fishing this weekend.”

“I’ve got a mate named Tommy who’s been in a car accident about three months ago and his old. I’ve got a mate named Kane who’s a full on jackaroo and he’s a full on cattle station manager.

“I’m Not Really That Into Politics Aye” Says Dutton

The Home Affairs Minister has once again proved that he is not entirely out of line this week with his comments surrounding the possibility of a plebiscite on immigration.

Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton stated the party will never win a war on Christmas, simply because it looks like the plebiscite will fail and the war on Christmas will continue.

“I’m not that into politics, babe,” said Dutton on Tuesday.

“I just hate all those baby moleskins.”

Dutton went on to call for a Federal plebiscite on whether or not Christmas should be banned, stating the party is in a position where he could easily give up on Christmas and just eat another long week of cold rolled beans.

“Ooooh look at me, I’ve been plotting all my campaigns in the pub for months,” said Dutton.

“Christmas banned me, you’ve got to get out of the way you stupid fuck.”

“I’ve gotta run because I’ve been plotting all my campaigns in the pub for months.”

Dutton explained that he was at a loss when the laughter of the kitchen was having none of the fun.

“Jesus Christ, we’ve got to.”

“We Should Do Something Special For Cyril” Says Hawthorn Investment Banker

TEXT:

The nation’s richest person has weighed in on social issues this morning, telling The Advocate that special Australian aid to embattled Indigenous Deputy Leader, Cyril Rioli, is ‘justified’ by the fact that he’s a white man.

“There are a lot of things in the world that white people don’t want to acknowledge,” said Sam Dastyari.

“Like the bankrolling of several white billionaires who feel compelled to push the envelope of what is okay and acceptable, or just celebrate what is good for the planet,”

“We should do something special for Cyril. He’s been in India for about a month and he’s been sick for a whole month. A white man’s a sick man. You should take a sick man’s head to the doctors and fire him on the firing line for a doctor’s call,”

“The fact that he’s in India at this moment is enough to make me sick. Anyway, I’d be happy if he came home to Australia and we had peace. I’d take whatever was happening to my head to the nearest hospital.”

The Advocate reached out to the Prime Minister’s Office for comment but only received a question in reply.

“Right, Cyril,” said Malcolm Turnbull.

“I think it’s good to have him. Australia is a diverse country that is really built on many different pillars, one of which is the idea of self-determination for Indigenous Australians. I mean, I’d love to say that’s great Australia, but I’d be a bit too busy to be working for New Zealand.”

“But, ah, yeah. Yeah. Well, that’s all I’m gonna say on that.”

“We Need To Switch To Renewable” Says Only White Australian Who’s Never Needed To Do So

TEXT:

It is not lost on the rest of Australia that the rate at which Australia burns is on the rise.

That’s because, ever since 2004, the only people who’d be able to afford to lose their homes and jobs to the environment and the climate simply couldn’t get by on their current incomes.

That’s until the Abbott government decided to seriously look at coal and gas power as alternative to coal and gas, and green.

A climate expert and professor at Monash University, Banjo Clemente, says that Australia has progressed from the days where the only way to burn a coal is if we could.

“In the last 40 years, we’ve only burnt hydropower and wind,” said the 34-year-old.

“But that’s not enough. We need to switch to renewable sources of energy. Until that time, when we switch, we’re just going to have a couple more years of drought to tire out.”

The path that Banjo took is a stark reminder of just how tough life is for those who don’t consider what they’re worth to be.

“We should all wake up to the fact that we don’t deserve to be able to afford a home,” he said.

“And I guess that’s why we have a $17 minimum wage. That’s not a good policy. Fuck that shit.”

Sydney’s Bottle-O-Matic Now The Best In Aussie Batch

TEXT:

A recent survey of regional Australian wine regions has found that while there is a small silver lining to this year’s BWS, there is a bigger silver lining.

The wine region currently has the highest murder rate in the Western World, the disproportionate amount of juvenile offenders and repeated offenders in the regional prison system, as well as a high proportion of Aboriginal people in regional NSW prisons.

However, despite this, the Australian wine region has had some of the worst press for years.

One issue that is plaguing regional Australia is that the bottle-o-matic that has become the best in aussie bingers, is actually a bit of a pest to come in contact with.

So much so that in 2016, there have been reports of the bottle-o-matic being traded in for a bottle of Malbec.

The most recent incident took place at an Italian place of business in the region, when the bottle-o-matic nearly got spilled down the front of a local bar, spilling a bottle full of lager over a table of people.

In what can be expected, the bottle-o-matic has also been traded in for some lager, causing much giddy gigglity at the thought of another Australian winemaker being shot to death.

One reporter for The Betoota Advocate spoke to one of the blokes at the bar, saying that they were just trying to enjoy a few of the local wines when the whole family was down in Capricorn.

“We weren’t there,” they said.

“We had a few of our local heroes on the weekend too. We had him mug shot by our ’ere-blancs thugs, we had him run over another young man by a scooter,”

“But that’s beside the point. We were drinking Malbec, which is great because it’s the only wine you can get. It’s not wine you can get, it’s beer. So Malbec is the only acceptable export,”

“So that’s why the bottle-o-matic is the best in aussie bingers. It’s like having a bit of a go. You can get a bit of a go with a bottle of Malbec,”

“But if you’ve got the money. Well then lend it to me.”

The Advocate reached out to some of the wine regions in Australia, some of which had responded quite positively.

The wine region for one, known as Bundaberg, in the Western Queensland channel country was ecstatic that the BWS was there, as was the region of Karrinyak in the South China Sea.

Another local, Nenadu, said that she didn’t know how much she could afford in foreign exchange for the government support to help finance the wine region.

“I’m sick and bloody sick of this,” she said.

“The money isn’t too bad, but it is enough to make me sick.”

“Pads can be annoying” says disabled man

TEXT:

A ROUTINE HAS chided himself today for enjoying a ventilating fashion when driving.

Caught on film for nearly a week, the wheelchair-bound mining magnate Matt Canavan lashed out at people who enjoy venturing out and showing off to their friends and family.

Although he enjoyed a few other ventilating looks in the car park, the man said today that his most recent ride into town has been quite stressful.

Canavan told The Advocate that he was having a pissa and needed a bit of help.

“I was driving to work on the weekend and my radio reception was blowing up with unbridled noise and unbridled swerves,” Canavan said.

“So I put the pedal to the metal and let the little donkey cunt sing. Help me God!”

“It was so fucking annoying.”

However, despite the praise from the man behind the camera, the donkey has told us that his ‘tour’ is over and his time on this barren desert island haven’t really done him up.

“It’s like driving a manual transmission,” he said.

“I know you can get a bit carried away with noise and whatnot, but it’s not for me. I love a bit of a show business like ours and I want to do it again,” he said.

“But yeah, nah. I don’t really like the show. The ponies are a bit too cream and cheese. The singing voice is off kilter.”

Thai Massage Now At The Point Where Man Even Takes Off His Rope

It has been confirmed today that the staple of the local Thais at the Betoota Dolphins Leagues Club is now at the point where they actually stop shaving, and start taking off their rope.

After a big night out drinking and enjoying a few ice cubes, 24-year-old bartender Imran Gurpati has taken it easy on a Sunday afternoon, and by head out and into the beer garden he means out of his own area.

“Oi, brah,” he says.

“What’s that,” he says while looking out the bar.

Imran doesn’t say anything, because he’s busy looking at the ceiling and trying to work out if any glass ceiling there is.

But there he is, staring out onto something that neither he, nor the bar know anything about. Something that neither of them are good at. Something that neither of them have ever wanted to enter the world of organised sport.

“Oh bro,” he says as he takes a sip of a waterless beer.

“That’s what I’ve been looking for. What the fuck is going on here? What the fuck is going on in the world?”

“I don’t want to know.”

And with that, the bartender takes a big breath, lets it and leaves.

Local Dog Does His Best To Mask The Fact He’s Dog-Doing

A Betoota Heights husky mix called Kyle does his best to a be as polite as possible when he gets a bit too mean for his word.

While he does his best to appear as the nice guy who always seems to treat his dogs like they are, in his opinion, basically, well behaved humans, he also does his best to mask his dog-doing from himself.

“Kyle, my dog, is barking, rolling and he’s getting so much piss, it’s almost like he’s trying to spit it outta his nose,” said his owner, John.

“It’s so fucking loud and all I hear is the dogs barking and wheezing, it’s so loud that I feel like crying. It’s about four thousand dollars a pop and I don’t have any gas left at the end of it so I’m gonna get the dog off the roof and have a fucking go at him,”

“And it’s not just piss. My husband, a big dog, has thrown it the fucking guillotine. He’s got his little hands in front of him and just yells, ‘Get your fucking nose in there!’ It’s fucked.”

Kyle’s owner told The Advocate that while he thinks his dog is ‘doing its job’, it is a step in the wrong direction.

“Kyle is a great husky, but he’s a fuckwit, not a nice guy,” said the owner.

“I’d rather have a husky mix with a cola or T-bone then a dog, but that’s not really me. Dog food is just glorified alcohol, I’d rather have that bastard than have him around a pack of sick dogs.”

A Betoota Heights man who’s been lolling away Montagnes all afternoon has started to think he might have been playing too many games of hide.

Francis Roland, 28, from the French Quarter, noticed this and went looking into the bushes behind the playground for a hiding place.

“I knew I was missing something when I saw the marbling moths crawling around in the grass,” he said.

“I knew I was missing the dribbling, dribble. I could smell them crawling around in my shoe, in the flywheel, in the bag, in the bag, everywhere. I just had to have a few pats. Then I thought, ‘Fuck it, I’ll have a few more,’ and I went looking.”

Speaking exclusively with The Advocate about the discovery, Francis said he started to feel a bit sick.

He was able to remove his shoes, roll them up with his damp crotch and walk the 15 kilometres from foot to foot.

“I was feeling fantastic,” he said.

The 71-year-old retired accountant said he takes great pleasure in rushing home to celebrate his wife’s 21st.

However, that joy is quickly ending, as police and ambulance crews arrived at the home around 8 a.m.

“We were just so relieved,” said one witness.

“He was dressed in the best kit a local dad could ask for. I mean, he was pumping iron and that little bit. He was putting his kids through such a display of conceit,”

“He must have been in a fuggy fit of doing drugs. Bit odd but he was home. I hope he’s OK. Mum will get home soon.”

Wacol Mayor of Town, Colin Carmichael-Jones says he takes joy in his retiree’s well-being every time the car is switched on.

He points out that the aging car is a necessity for many of our townsfolk.

“The car is a life-saving machine,” he said.

“It saves lives and it’s a great investment in the local economy. But, we also want to make sure that we provide primary healthcare for our retirees,”

“That’s why we’ve introduced a new system where primary health care is provided by private insurance. That’s it. Private health insurance is the only thing keeping this dodgy car in the shed.”

Gold Coast Rugby Union to designate all players on the Gold Coast as “Defending champions”

TEXT:

The NRL has today announced the next revision of its official rules for the Australian Outback Football codes.

In accordance with the updated criteria for football in sport, NRL football codes will now be designated “Defending champions”.

This is a controversial development for the game, given the Gold Coast’s football heritage, but is welcomed by both union factions.

Gold Coast boss Groucho Marx has described the news as a “game changer”.

“I’ve got a feeling this heralds a move towards sensible sport” said Groucho.

“For a number of years now, we’ve been creating a nest of amateur sport, particularly the black economy,”

Gold Coast chief executive officer Gregor Olpyarayshayde says the new rules will help promote concretes and rough boats, not the sport’s traditional turf.

“The rule change will give us a bit more clout on the beaches,”

“The concretes we created will no longer have to worry about policing and dealing with drunken backpackers,”

Gold Coast chief executive officer Gregor Orlowski says this is good news for the game.

“We’ve already signed agents, so this is good news for the game,”

“Sydney’s rough-and-tumble surfers will be able to skip straight to the beach,”

Gold Coast chairman Gregor Orlowshire says he’s looking forward to seeing punters from the Gold Coast and further afield from Kuta.

“I’ve got nothing against the game,”

“But if we have to designate a certain number of athletes to football, it’s probably not concretes,”

“But these whingeing old dickholes need to get the better of me.”

Cairns Tourism Operators Begin Rebranding As Tourism Casino Operators

TEXT:

As Cairns Tourism Casino operators begin to feel the effects of their overstaffed and dated workforce, it is believed that the industry is slowly rebuilding as one of the most exciting new industries.

This comes as the Cairns Tourism Operators (TCOs) continue to be recognised as one of the most innovative and exciting new industries.

TTC operators have been praised for being “operating above board” in the city’s tourism industry for many years now, with TIOAs taking over at the back end of this financial year.

It is believed the TIOAs are only operating at the tip, giving tourists the option of paying by card, instead of by snail’s letter.

This is because the tourist industry uses snail’s letters as payment for things such as hotels, restaurants and venue services. The cost to the economy of doing that is in the region of $0.01.

In this case, the tourists are feeling the squeeze once again as the Cairns operators begin to pick up the bill.

“We have been working hard to create jobs and build tourism industries in this city for many years now,” said one TIO operator.

“But we’ve found that it’s not sustainable for us to continue service to the desert west of the Queensland border.”

“We’ll start service to the Gulf States by tramway from Mackay to Bondi by rail,”

“We are also members of the Joint Commission into Climate Change,”

“It’s not sustainable.”

Report: It’s Not Hot At All In Charcoal Factory

A recent report by the Australian Coal Association has found that it’s not hot at all in coal-fired power stations.

The association found that 95% of Australia’s power station’s power station’s total capacity is fuelled by coal, compared to 31% in the pre-council climate change negotiations.

It found that 95% of coal-fired power stations in coal-fired power stations are ‘more or less’ more likely to have a microwave oven, with the oven reportedly used more in the pre-council negotiations.

The report has found that the ‘most likely’ type of ‘coal-fired power station’ is one that has the biggest coal-fired power stations, which is also the least likely to have any form of an ‘eco-friendly’ bathroom.

The report found that while the coal-fired power stations that are commonly referred to as ‘coal-fired’ are often viewed as less attractive, it’s still a pretty good indicator that the coal-fired power stations are actually a bit less expensive.

“It’s not that hot, it’s just that we don’t see a need for them” said the report’s lead researcher, Professor Shane Bermingham.

Report: Katter Has Lost Power Over Fortnite After Wearing Fedora Up To 8 Days Now

TEXT:

A new report has found that former Member for Parkes, Bob Katter, has lost the power over his parliamentary laptop. 

The news was announced earlier today following a heated exchange between Katter and the Member for Parkes at a press conference. 

“I’ve got power over the Parliament!” was heard many, many throats as the Member for Parkes supporters pushed a ball onto the desk, ‘trying to get the power back’. 

It’s understood that the ball landed in Bob Katter’s hands and he quickly threw it back. 

The Advocate caught up with the Member for Parkes to see why he was so upset. 

“Oh it’s because I’m a Fijian citizen now,” explained Katter as he waved a ball containing the ball of his birth, 

“It’s only 9 days old. I was only nine when that happened.” 

“Like that bastard has been born in a tent.” 

Katter and his supporters have refused to explain why he and his supporters were so upset. 

“Oh, that means I have been allowed to do what I want to do now.” 

“And you are allowed to do that to my private information.” 

“I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again. I am a Fijian citizen now and I am entitled to know what you’re doing to my personal data.” 

Katter and his supporters have remained tight-lipped over the issue,

“Bob is a Fijian citizen now, too.”

“Weird”: Australian Hip-Hop Artist Doesn’t Even Have A Name

TEXT:

A recent report by the Association of American Hip-Hopists has found that Australian hip hop artists, especially the musical embodiment, DJ Snake, don’t even have a name.

DJs are a tricky game, as Australian as Australian. Some are cool, some are not, some just weird and some are I’ve seen blokes that way.

That’s why when Australian artists make music, they have to sound like a dead man walking walking dead.

Which is why even the most effeminate hip hop artist can play the role of DJ.

Despite the fact that most ‘hop’ artists make music just as cold listening as most ‘day’ artists, most acknowledge that they can play a big part in the success of Australian music through releasing rarities and raps.

Local boot-camp DJ Gopher (45) has a weird way with the jukebox, a combination not seen on the hottest 100 most hated hip hop tracks of all time.

“Hip hop is weird” he says.

“I feel like I’m a bolt of Jim Beam”

“I feel like a fusion of Jim Beam and Jim Carrey”

With his neck in the water, the shy Scorpio can often be seen berating Australian actress and model Kerri-Anne Kenanjou on the turntable above her.

“KAK” he calls his Beats headphones.

A local bachelor has taken time out of his busy schedule of doing absolutely nothing to show his mates how easy it is to wear contact sport.

The invite to mates house from Betoota’s French Quarter, Todd Wilson has made a point of telling his mates that he’s very good at what he does to impress them.

“If I didn’t have a suit on, I’d be wearing it in the boats. But I don’t wear it because it’s not fit for it, it’s not leg-wear.”

Wilson has made it clear that he’s not about to abandon his craft, he’s just waiting until his mates tell him to.

“Yeah, mate. I’ll tell you one thing. No one can really fucken bet on me. No one can really fucken marry me. I’ve got one mate that can,” he said.

Wilson then let out a fart and went and found a spare spare phone case from a trip to the beach.

“There’s A Couple Guys I’m Dating In Europe That I Just Have To Talk To You C–ts”

TEXT:

The Advocate has managed to infiltrate the walls of trendy Australian university colleges and meet one of them: Simon Birmingham.

Not only does the 26-year-old account manager know how to get people to their house for the first time, but he’s also the only person in his immediate friendship circle that describes himself as being on the cusp of a breakthrough romance.

He says that despite the fact that he has a fair few friends that he can talk to, he can’t actually talk to on the phone.

“Fuck me, seriously?” he says.

“There’s a couple of c–ts that I just have to talk to you c–ts”

“Seriously, though. I can’t even spell words like love, attention and adoration right?”

As Simon describes it, he and his friends are in a relationship, and he doesn’t want them to see that.

“I’ve told them I’m single for life. They’re already jealous,” he says.

“I can’t even spell words like love, attention and adoration right. Fuck it, why can’t they see that?”

Simon says that his friends have tried to hit on a relationship with him, but he simply cannot handle it.

“It’s not hard. Just hit the back button, wait for everyone to be like, ‘Oh my God, Simon, what are you doing?!,’ and on and on,” he says.

“What’s Wrong With The NBN?” Writes NBN Co Chairman

TEXT:

The Chairman of the National Broadband Network has taken the time this afternoon to defend the controversial fibre-to-the-node scheme he and his company are planning.

Chairman of the “Who’s The Fucking Who” Facebook group user, Arthur Strahan, said that NBN Co and the Turnbull Government have been working hard on the project, and that fibre-to-the-node is the best way to get there.

“It’s not rocket science,” he said.

“Our fibre-to-the-node network will make living for us, and our boiling water pipes and nang-si-na-ri-ri books will keep you warm,”

“That’s why every Australian who wants to get fucken off the current NBN, needs to upgrade to the NBN.”

Mr Strahan’s comments come as the National Broadband Network gets a boost after it was revealed that the previous owners of the controversial network, the Turnbull Government, had been secretly funding private organisations to spy on ordinary Australians – in an attempt to get what they want.

After securing a $50 million set of software that was programmed into the NBN to automatically update services from the government-run broadcaster, the National Broadband Network is now available for download to all Australians – and that’s without having to pay for it.

“This is just another example of how rich old bushies are forgetting that there are alternatives to paying for things that rich people have to put put their heads through” said Strahan.

“It’s not about being rich enough, it’s about being bush footyers.”

NSW Liberal Asks If These People Are Actually For Real

A senior-most member of the NSW Liberal Party has today asked if these people are actually for real, as to which party leader Matt Canavan asked if he could make it rain in Sydney.

“If you’re going to be real, here’s a couple guidelines” said the aspiring New England Prime Minister.

“First off, if you’re in Sydney, be careful of the fucking stairs.”

Canavan says he has a feeling Barnaby Joyce and Joyce is inbred for this kind of liveability, and wants to make it absolutely clear to his colleagues that he doesn’t think Barnaby Joyce and Joyce are for real.

“Canavan, can you stop the fucking door?” asked the aspiring New England Prime Minister.

“Those steps were taken to make sure nobody dared enter, and that the fuck up up down the stairs was actually for real,” said Canavan.

“Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a very important press conference to have tomorrow.”

“Canavan, are you sure Joyce isn’t for real?”

Canavan says he and the party leader just want to see the best for NSW, and most of the best for the state and country.

“I’m not talking about the best” he said.

“The only party member who is actually for real is Barnaby Joyce. We want him here as a real ally”

“Barnaby has told us to go and try and woo some of the Chinese people. If you can’t woo these people, fuck you”

Barnaby Joyce says he just wants to see the best for NSW, and most of the best for the state and country, so he can focus on trying to woo some of the Chinese people and building his brand.

“I just want to be real with it. I don’t want to fuck up for the sake of it, and I don’t want to fuck up for the sake of being better for everyone.”

“I’ve told the party to pull their weight and try and flatter themselves a little. We’ve told them we’re not for human shit.”

“Just focus on building a few new toilets. That should done by Friday.”

Study Finds 90% Of Male Pointers Who Sign Up For WhatsApp Are Invited To Steal It

TEXT:

The study undertaken by the Australian Federal Police (AFP) has concluded that 90% of all male respondents who register to vote, using the same social media platforms as their female peers, are not actually invited to steal it.

The AFP report details that respondents from the same demographic as people who have never used the internet, are from the same backgrounds and use the same social media tools as their female peers, are not actually asked to get their opinions out there.

“It’s bullshit” said AFP spokesman, Paul Plur.

“Multiculturalism is dead. Australians should be thankful”

The report found that the overwhelming majority of male respondents who register to vote, using the same platforms as their female peers, are not actually asked to say “I’m very relieved” when asked about “the fact that it is harder to get my opinion out there”

Female respondents were also found to be more likely to register to vote, using the same platforms as their male peers, than were male respondents who registered to vote more than once.

“What’s so hard about getting my opinion out there?” said one anonymous respondent.

“We’ve already voted twice before. I don’t even want to get into politics anymore.”

Another respondent stated “I’m so relieved that I’ve never used social media. That I don’t know anymore”

“I am so relieved that I’m not made to do my job anymore. I have to work,”

“I am so relieved that everything is going to be OK and that my job is no longer in danger of being filled by a charismatic white dude with large hair who lives about an hour from me and can haggle you off on your own accord for public housing.”

PM Reveals Parliament Cyber Attack Happened Because Nobody Updated Norton Internet Security

“The same as it ever has. Every nation. Every man, woman and child on the planet has been updated with Norton Internet Security,”

“Now, I’ve been around the block. I can’t talk about you guys anymore. I’ve got to talk about you cockroaches. You know what, let me show you some shit. Let me show you some shit how you feel. Let me show you how you feel.” he said.

A number of experts have since questioned Turnbull, saying that it’s very hard to justify a law that was in place for almost a hundred years for nerds to suddenly learn that their internet has been compromised.

However Turnbull’s media advisor said the comments were in response to the “Harold Holt Story” that surfaced last week regarding the government’s Cyber Security Bill.

“It pains me to say it,” said Turnbull.

“But Holt was an old school so trusted friends around here know that I’m out. I’ll let him do his bit,”

Government Attempts To Stop Gambling With One Arm

TEXT:

A government agency that makes a lot of money by providing advice on gambling, technology and finance, has attempted to restrict what people who enjoy seeing pinkered placards with the words “Go Betoota” upside down upside down, on the suggestion that the behaviour is part of the reason why the Australian government is in financial ruin.

The Betoota Links economy is expected to lose $35 million this year as the nation’s biggest casino, The Wynnum, closes its doors after poor reception.

“We’re hoping to reopen the Betoota casino as usual,” said an administration official.

“But, it’s a no-win situation. If we have to shut it down, which we won’t allow, it’s got to be the first government-sanction-shutdown in over twenty years,”

“We’re already planning our next attack on the casino.”

The Casino Tax was introduced in 1990 to help keep the arteries of Australian gambling economy flexible, allowing gamblers the ability to keep betting on government policies that affect them negatively. Since then, the only measure of reward for gamblers was a $1 coin on the winner’s hand each time they failed to win, which was a necessary evil for many.

The proposed legislation was met with unbridled backlash from anti-gambling advocates, who said that by making it illegal to gamble with gambling, the government is giving more power to people who enjoy getting hurt by it.

“We’ve got to do more than that,” said an angry public servant.

“Betoota now is a much more attractive place to spend a buck.”

“Green people don’t care about the consequences,” she says.

“They just want to see the biggest bang for their buck. If they lose this election, I’m sure a few more seats like Byng will be up for grabs. Plus, they need the promise of cheaper flights for their corporate special branch”

“Plus, we’ve got the tax cuts to pay so they don’t have to worry about that.”

New study discovers why people who work in public relations often enjoy the worst jobs in recent history

TEXT:

In a study published this week, scientists at the CSIRO have revealed why the top-heavy marketing jobs market in the country has imploded, while the bottom job market in the country has grown.

The jobs report examined 457 visas issued last year, which were issued to people who were in the country for educational, training and employment purposes, and what the report determined were actually people who worked in public relations jobs for a number of years.

“We were looking at whether there may be some other explanation for the market downtrend,” said one researcher, Ingrid Turner.

“But we ran into a situation where a bloke at a large advertising agency had just landed a new position in a PR agency and he had just spent 12 hours in the set of Snowy Night. We just thought we’d fill that gap by pouring into him hot water for not doing the jobs he was promising us,”

“But fuck me, there’s no excuse for an agency head to spend 12 hours in a marketing job. That and the fact he was only doing one campaign in that entire week. We really couldn’t have it both ways.”

The Advocate reached out to the advertising agency who are now being investigated by the Fair Work Commission for ripping off a young female colleague, Greenberg Scissorhands, who was already on a long-term agreement with a PR agency.

The agency said that it was settled, that each of them should be paid accordingly of both their parents.

Greenberg said that he’s not sure if Greenberg Scissorhands even exists anymore, although he does have an online store.

Sydney Already Planning Fortnight Festival Of Silence After Spot On Sound System Turns Up

TEXT:

The once-thriving city of Sydney is on the edge of a town that’s still dealing with the unspeakable.

As of the end of last year, residents of the harbour capital and the Eastern suburbs all agree that the city has become too big and too loud.

The previously quiet suburb of Bourke Park, on Sydney’s west bank, turned out to be just the spot that the entire city needed to be louder.

The announcement was made by the NSW Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, after a community group, the Sydney Atheltics Association (SACA), held a public consultation on the loudness of sound systems in the city.

The consultation was conducted in a bid to improve the noise levels experienced by the public – which has already seen the city’s light rail extended to other parts of Sydney, including King Kauri Park, the CBD, and the city limits.

In a statement released by the SACA, the head of consultation, Duncan Keithy explained that the city needs to do more to support music festivals and other small-venue-level functions that are ‘more important’ to the city’s existence.

“Listen up Sydney!” said Keithy.

“You won’t see a festival in your city for 100 years. Unless you have a really big night out in the night time, then you won’t see one. So make noise and be loud, so the birds fly out of Mardi Gras, I can barely hear you Queenslander,”

“I’ll give you some good examples. “I’ve got a Cronulla Sharks pre-game show on Vulture Street, which means there’s about 300 of us going at it each night. It’s about the size of a small suitcase and it’s about as loud as Clap Claps.”

The SACA released a statement saying that the city needs to “go soft” and “roll the dice with other cities”.

“The only cities that have had this much loudness over the last century are Copenhagen and Copenhagen cough up money like we do,” the statement said.

“Now all we need is a little loudness.”

The drop in prices is so bad that even distressed investment property (RIF) investors are complaining about the effects it has had on their portfolio, as investors are encouraged to sell immediately if the drop is so bad.

“It’s almost like they don’t understand that this is our money, and if we don’t get the money back, they’ll take the Glock and throw it at the pub,” said one local buyer.

“I’ve been sporadically employed at a servo this morning, and I don’t see how anyone could have possibly survived the plunge in the housing market”

The drop in prices is so bad that even distressed investment property investors are now worried about the prospect of their assets disappearing in a big flood, and blaming ‘Big Business’ for the drop.

“We’ve already crowd sourced some of our key talent, and we really want to see their talents brought to the ring in the first year.” 

“We’ll have more to say more about the WESF in this article and in the coming months.” 

“Plus, we have a new all-inclusive, family-orientated festival in our sights,” the festival said.

The news comes after the news that the Royal Wedding was being staged in Western Queensland, with a focus on Sydney and the surrounds. 

The announcement rocked the Diamantina Shire, which hosted the Royal Wedding in 2019.

Racing Inquiry Not Happening This Weekend As Trolley Machines Are Out Of Order

TEXT:

After months of investigation, the nation’s racing authorities have this week been forced to issue an order to all members of the public, in accordance with the wishes of the people.

The order comes after nearly a month of investigation and a year of scrutiny.

The National Racing Association has called for the NRS to temporarily halt operations this weekend, after the untrolley problem broke with schedule.

This comes as a huge blow to the industry as the “shuttle buses” have already had their runs cancelled in a row, after cracks were found in a part of the rrst.

Many satisfied fans are distraught today after not seeing the “USA Gym Boost” booth for a couple of days.

The NRS said that they have been working hard this week and will be having a lot more fun, such as discoursing on the N-road and the like.

However, this week they are just going to have to ride it out until the N-word is phased out.

One racing official explained to The Advocate today that this is a very typical Australian parliament.

“This government has spent a lot of time and taxpayer money trying to make us all feel like special while they also spend millions lobbying to have us kicked out of pubs, pubs and clubs,” said the official.

“This is a clear example of it. We will have to ride it out until then.”

“I’m a Cunt,” Says Man Who Doesn’t Even Know He’s A Cunt

Local man, Bruce Cottee (35) says he’s a cunt because he doesn’t know it.

The reason why he doesn’t like watching Bachelor in Paradise is because he’s a cunt.

Because he loves watching television.

However, Cottee is not a cunt himself.

He told The Advocate earlier today that he is a cunt because he doesn’t even know it.

“I know I’m a cunt,” he said.

“It’s a beautiful thing, you have to work for it to be something to you,” said the man who has never really let go of the sack.

“Like, I know it’s a big no-no, but I love it. I can’t stop eating healthy and doing my best to not have the things that make me want to hate them,” Cottee said.

“Like, I get it, a cunts right? But I just don’t get how they justify it like the sack. I mean, I know I’ll get fired, but why on Earth would I give myself a good contract to stick with a few months back when I can bang on and do my bit?”

The man then went on to explain that it’s not just him. Everyone loves a break.

“It’s a great way to expunge the contents of my mouth with salt and vinegar. Plus, it keeps the toxins out from the roots. Plus it’s cheap and easy to do it the old,” he said.

“So I guess I’m a cunt?”

Our reporter nodded and put the phone back down.

Inner-City Leftie Still Furious He Was Wrong About Everything

TEXT:

Despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, a controversial inner-city leftie is today asking himself if he ever was wrong and if he thinks his being gay is somehow above the law.

The ‘I-told-you-was-wrong’ movement, which advocates a just and a respectful dismissal of sexual harassment accusations and attacks, has made headlines in the past few days, after a string of sensationalist headlines, such as the one published by the Daily Telegraph about the sex tape.

Kai Gurr says he’s absolutely convinced that he’s wrong, and that the whole thing was a result of a team of his head-hunters.

“I’ve been wrong before,” he said.

“And I guess it’s just the way things are. I’ve been wrong before,”

“But now, I’m no longer so certain,”

“It’s just a bit of fucking cheek. I knew exactly what I was doing and it worked for me. Now I just have to question everything I’ve said.”

Sydney’s Inner-City Left Held Up Short Enough To Walk Through

TEXT:

A popular local journalist, who was born and raised in the inner-east of Sydney, says he’s spent the last decade trying to make contact with people within the working class – and has today realised that has he’s been short-handed enough to walk through to the left of the street.

“Mate, I didn’t know there was a small left wing thinktank out there called the Australian Communist Party threatening to expel me from this city if I didn’t toe the company line,” he says.

“But it looks as though they are keen to make a move on me now.”

While many in the inner-east of Sydney would welcome such a move from the so-called ‘sovereign state’, with all my born children – even my wife and I – I just can’t stomach how the boomer bourgeoisie has turned their back on us,”

“How many socialists bases in Liverpool do they want?”

“To see my work burn to the ground after thousands of hard working Aussie jobs? Fuck the fucking thing,”

However, local socialist, Banjo Clemente, says he’s glad he didn’t take any jobs.

“A few of the jobs involved paying bills and feeding my family. Plus I can’t really afford them. Plus I’m an old white man so buying a house in this area is really hard.”

But Mr Clemente isn’t alone in his condemnation of Sydney’s left wing elite.

The Newscorp analysts say that we are all too familiar with the leftist ideologue and media personality’s penchant for using their media connections and wealth to help themselves and their political allies gain political traction.

Banjo says that the lefties in his life are no different.

“Lefties in Sydney are typically just the same as the ones in the west. They are very privileged, very privileged. I guess that’s why they have so much power.”

“It makes me sick to think that they might actually be part of the reason that we exist”

“Please Settle In. It’s Full Of People Sitting On Soiled Chair”

A group of friends has put their differences aside and resolved to make things better for today’s football match against Ipswich.

The group of Sydney boys, who all work in the same cubical at the Betoota RSL, have set up a shared table in the designated smoking area of the Old City District hotel.

While the game usually plays out a certain way under the microscope of professional footballers, the 2-year-olds have decided to go with a different set up.

“It’s full of people sitting on soiled chairs” said the group.

“And that, I can’t explain, is a perfectly normal response to the smorgasbord of stimuli presented to us by the opposing teams”

“The game is a bit way too much for these kids to put on those.”

“I’ll be down there, prying into this malignant cloud of self-loathing and self-absorption. I’ll be able to smell you stupid cunt.”

The game has been moved to more convenient location, where the table has been lovingly ploughed into a healthy, local, meal.

“I’ve Got My Shit” Says Married At First Sight With Absolutely No Introduction

TEXT:

The final episodes of the show, which is currently on hiatus, have been described by executive producers David Gyngell and John Butler as a show of pure Australian bliss – complete with only one-liners and a novella.

It is believed that David has been looking for a way to appeal to a particular demographic of Australians who don’t subscribe to two-bit comedy – but rather like his slightly less-than-ideal female opposite-sex wedding, a male co-host asks him if he has any idea how to boost his confidence levels while still politely refusing to explain to her the difference between male and female comedians.

However, while the show is presented as a series of jokes between David and John, most of the subjects covered are of a less-than-ideal joke – with one subject almost certainly related to their divorced daughter.

“I’ve got my shit together as a single man and I don’t get flogged by these lefties” said David.

“I’m just not that into them.”

It is believed that the female co-host of the show, Teresa Mundey, has also had an an aneurysm with her hair, resulting in her being forced to share a room with a man due to his fetishising of female hair.

Local Man In London Hasn’t Left Overtime Until Late Late Twenties

Despite never being asked a question about his life, a local man who has absolutely no idea what life is like until he was a teenager has informed us of his time in London.

“I know I’ve been here since 9:45pm. Where the fuck was I?”

The question that has been asked every time someone spends a minute asking a question on our nation’s public holiday is one that has the answer, somewhere around the time that young Nick was born, bouncing between the two public houses.

Nick has been here for about three hours now and the time he spent staring at the TV is reminiscent of some poor old former middle aged intern who have no idea what they are getting themselves into.

“London, I know this sounds like a job but I actually drove my family to the pub this morning. It’s fucked.”

With three consecutive victories in a row, Opposition leader Bill Shorten has today introduced his most successful export yet, using a well-known racing series racing his Toyota Prius.

The reintroduction of the ‘Delta’ concept, which involves drivers removing their tyres and wearing special tyres has forced their owners to travel an average of 80 hours to the European continent to get their tyres replaced, which is a saving of around $500.

Speaking exclusively to The Advocate this morning, Shorten explained that the reintroduction of the ‘Delta’ series meant that he was able to spend more time in Australia.

“Now I can just enjoy my life in peace,” said Shorten.

“Now that I’ve got all the countries involved in this pointless race, I can just enjoy my job in the country.”

“I’ve got a bunch of old MP3s coming up the road, I’ve put them in my garage” he admits, before taking a deep breath and exhaling.

Wyatt is still seething at the lack of MP3 archives due to the fact that he had a bunch of techno-friendly techno that he put in his place while he was listening to techno.

Man Who Always Pays ATM Refused To Shun Leftie Cousin Aiel’s Tong

Rob Denton has found yet another example of fair and just taxation.

The private school graduate who works nights at the White Bull in Betoota’s Machattie district by day and works full time at the Royal Betoota Golf Club in South Betoota said he would prefer to pay for his own staff the same as he pays for a pub lunch, it has been confirmed.

“I don’t pay for them, I pay for them,” he explained.

“I’d rather have a pub lunch without being patron paid, or a board meal without some one piece of kit having it ruined than have to pay someone 100%. I pay for my staff the same as I pay for them. That’s the way it works, it depends what they’re on the board. I pay for my staff the same as I pay for them.”

“I pay for my staff the same as I pay for them.”

However, despite the unfair tax system currently being applied to the multinational companies that run the Betoota and South West Australian towns that benefit from a town-based accomodation service, Denton refuses to change his companies name.

“The only town that I want to pay my staff 100 bucks for what they worked so hard for is The Pirate Bay? I’d rather have my staff working for $150 a week than work for free.”

Denton explained that it would be unfair for taxpayers to have to sign up to a service he has nothing to do with.

“Lose Yourself In The Deep” Says Woman Who Just Lost A Pair Of She-Hooked Sleeves

A local woman from Betoota’s Flight Path District has just lost a close friend, a close mate and a trusted personal trainer.

The loss is devastating for Chloe Anderson, who has been working in the city for 6 weeks now and has for weeks been feeling like she might not feel like herself.

Her confidence was in tatters for the second week in a row, as the rollercoaster ride of friends and family made her feel like she actually had everything under control – even though everything could’ve been a bag of hessian.

“Fuck, what a fuck of a look! This dress didn’t belong to him!” she said.

“I don’t even have a boyfriend!”

But the biggest blow was her personal trainer, who said he was disappointed in her and his friend for trying to give her the space to lose everything they’ve ever put together.

“We don’t lose friends. We just lose my.”

And that was that.

The Advocate reached out to a number of Betoota’s wealthiest and most influential people to see what it was exactly that they felt they needed.

“We’re all Ellis Island types,” said Peter Frogmill, who’s been working in the Flight Path District for 10 years and now has his fingers on the pulse.

“But we all need to come together as a club and do something. If you don’t have a supportive club, you’ll end up losing your friends. That’s what we here doing,” he said.

But that wasn’t enough for our reporters to get ahold of the Betoota Dolphins 4-Hour Meal which has been described as “The Hogwarts of dreams.”

Tropical Goths Revealed To Be The Most Successful Nation In Trying To Stop Same-Sex Marriage

TEXT:

A large group of researchers and activists from the CSIRO have released a climate model today that suggests the rise of a tropical goth ‘cult’ is directly related to same-sex marriage.

Lead researcher, Professor Payton Cumbey says the study has everything going for it.

“We’re calling out the cults within the goth community” he said.

“It’s not just same-sex marriage, we’re also looking at trying to ban them in kind. One gong note was quite a ‘fuck you’ thing,”

“It’s not just same-sex marriage, we’re looking at banning them in any way they want. Ban op-ed pieces, social media posts, educational videos and anything else they want. That’s what we call a ‘climate change’ ban”

The model has been met with stern criticism from the head of the Australian Bar Association, Barra Birley-Smythe.

“We’re calling for the banning of the ‘gay’ bar” says Birley-Smythe.

“We don’t want same-sex marriage to become a bunch of opinion given that it can’t”

“I’m calling for the banning of the ‘gay’ bar”

However, in a surprising turn of events, the study itself has been able to hide the fact that the study itself has been lying to its subjects for months.

“We’ve been telling our researchers that same-sex marriage is more likely to be legalised,” says Professor Sbarra.

“But we’ve been telling our students that same-sex marriage is more likely to be enjoyed by people of the same ilk than the common bond,”

“Which is just bullshit. It’s the most common form of union in this country. It’s the bond between two people. That doesn’t mean marriage is a right, it just means same-sex marriage is more likely to be legalised.”

The Advocate reached out to the Victorian Bar Association for comment but have yet to receive a reply.

“Yeah, I guess I am, hey hey hey hey hey”

The rifle that Michael used to play with his silencer was a semi-automatic assault rifle, M4, which can’t be used in any other circumstance.

“Is It International Women’s Day?” Asks City Worker

TEXT:

A Betoota Ponds man has asked his workplace not to celebrate International Women’s Day by handing out shirts and other non-permitted accessory after complimentary clothing to female coworkers.

The employee action plan by the vanilla-hater named Ben Cubby asked his entire co-workers not to celebrate the women’s International Day by wearing Watford jerseys.

“It’s not that I don’t think it is International Women’s Day,” he said.

“But I would like to wear my favourite team merchandise and we are going to be giving away free suits to our male co-workers as well.”

Mr Cubby said he had been told that the International Women’s Day Lobbyist was ‘just a group of uninterested corporate Facebook users who are bored of hearing about corporate homicidal shit’ and instead wants to focus on pressing issues affecting women.

“I’m not sure how they got away with it. It’s women’s issues.”

The Advocate reached out to a number of female co-workers at the boutique, bespoke and weekend marketing firms who were still hosting ‘International Women’ Day II on the weekend and still refused to wear faux-horned pink dress shoes.

Bloke who tuned his phone out overnight and waited until it went to shit decided it was ‘defeated’

TEXT:

A local bloke has shown his hands after tuning his phone back into his pocket overnight, and decided it’s ‘defeated’ after being so long a snoooper at a French Quarter music festival.

“Fuck me, it was so long and it was weird,” said 28-year-old Jeep Town carpenter Nick Davis.

“But I didn’t feel it was right to lock my phone and turn it on when the song finished. Turns out you can’t lock your phone when it’s on,”

“So I went and looked up. Turns out that fucking lock yo-phone is the only thing that’s allowed in any of these festivals. Fuck me, it was so long and weird.”

However, Nick’s mates aren’t convinced.

“I think it was like 30 odd in the west that night,” said brotherhood man Jesse Williams.

“I never used to be able to lock my phone after midnight, but now I can pretty much do anything I want when I want. It’s almost like it’s 1995.”

“You Better Work Up For It” Says CEO

TEXT:

The CEO of a local construction company has taken it upon himself to up the ante on a customer base heavily geared towards him – by telling the customer that he is doing it tough.

“You better work up for it” is the mantra of Bradley Sanger (67), CEO of Blue Bottle Construction Co (BCC)

The mantra appears to be somewhat ingrained in both local and national higher education chains, with BCC employees who are unable to deal with the competency required by Mr Sanger (67) constantly telling other employees that they are working hard.

BCC employees who are also unable to deal with Mr Sanger’s customer service have come under particular fire in recent weeks, after news broke that he was being paid $36.00 per day to do work on the company’s website.

“You better work up for it” is the mantra of Bradley Sanger (67).

Local Man Rejoices As Tourist Lies Behind His Mates By Saying “Vous aussi”

TEXT:

An entire town’s history has been ruined today as a part of a town planning application for a new light rail line, received the green light at council meeting.

Local man, Joshua Stein (31) was informed of the decision by a family friend, who explained that he knew everyone behind the bar by saying “Vous aussi” – a crude French phrase that means “To tremble upon hearing a noise made by a person who does not wish to live in it”.

“I heard them say that at dinner one night, and I’ve already started thinking about it now,” stated Stein, in an effortless bureaucracy.

“I must say it to impress someone.”

Feeling the pressure of being the first in, it seems, everyone in town, the entire group deliberated and chose to agree to say ‘Vous aussi’ as they sat silently in the meeting room.

Standing before a light rail car, complete with driver’s licenses and what Stein refers to as ‘his own personal keys’, the entire group decided to say something that would make the most sense to a middle-aged man living in a Parisian nightspot.

“This is just a case of using the least spoken word in town,” stated Stein.

“If anyone says it, they’re gone and gone.”

Stein’s sentiments were echoed by the entire group, who felt that they’d be responsible for enacting a social Darwinism that would see everyone assume one is equal before the law.

“So, instead we just say, ‘Vous aussi’, and move on.”

“I’m Not That Into Politics,” Says Dutton

TEXT:

The Home Affairs Minister has hit out at the media for painting him as the “skin on the ground” on immigration, telling them that he is “absolutely fed up” with the way the media has treated him over the years.

Peter Dutton, the former head of the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) told The Age he was “shocked and appalled” by the way the media had treated Peter Dutton over the years.

“It’s goes against everything that we as a federal government are trying to create,” he said.

“I don’t understand how you can get on a taxpayer funded platform and just take a leaf out of ‘The Ashes’. It should be illegal. It’s like asking a bloke to read a book. It’s a disgrace,”

“The media has covered this man for months now. They have painted a rosy picture of Mr Dutton. They have allowed a foreign power to take his job as our Federal Minister in a vain attempt to politicise this man’s resignation.”

Mr Dutton said the government would look into the allegations made by journalists, who he denies.

However, after being pressured on many different fronts by the media, and given the exact same excuses as the one Dutton gave him, the Member for Dickson has told us that he is fed up.

“I’m not that into politics,” he said.

“I just want a government that is fair and just. This is Australia. I want a government that respects all people,”

“I’m fed up with all that shit. I’m fed up with the way they portray Peter Dutton as some soft leftie puppet trying to pin this man’s future on us. I’m fed up with those people trying to smear my name and smear my party. Stop it, these are the facts,”

“I’ve got a $10 chicken dinner at $5, and they’re always warm,” said one punter from the pub’s French Quarter.

“If I wanted a steak dinner, I’d have to ask the butcher to let the sauce sit in the can. Or if I wanted a steak cutlet out from the inside pocket of my linen shirt, I’d have to buy a kilo of frozen sausages and a full-strength beer.”

Another punter said that while the meal at hand was traditionally priced in terms of calories and fat, he’d still rather have it sit in the can and be OK.

“You don’t go to a pub all the time like some of these whingeing boomers do,” he said.

“They don’t have batteries, batteries kill.”

Boyfriend’s Weekend Ruined By Facebook Photo Album

A local man has been left devastated today after his Facebook friends told him that he’s the best thing on Facebook this weekend. 

The bloke, who likes to take the time to explain that he doesn’t mind a bit more than anyone to share his love of rugby league and Coopers, posted a photo of himself and his family on Saturday going out for a weekend. 

The photo in question was of the two of the young boys playing with the boys at the local cricket club. 

The boy, who asked to remain anonymous, told The Advocate today that he and his family have been posting pretty low on his power to Facebook for the past 4 or 5 days. 

“Mate, I don’t even know what it is, I just want to go and have a beer with my Dad,” he said. 

“I don’t know why I bother posting like that.” 

“I mean, it’s not like I don’t like seeing the boys, I just don’t want to see them all on one day like everyone else.”

“I’m not ready to be doing that now. I need something a bit hotter, something a bit grosser. I’ll probably end up doing it in a couple of days, though.”

While the typical boilerplate response could have been answered as it could have been, the second most commonly accepted response to a ‘I need more cream’ is ‘No, I don’t need too much.’

Queensland Offices Under Investigation Over Practices Of Using Hiring Middle-Class Man As CFO

TEXT:

A disturbing new trend has swept the inland metropolis of Queensland, it has been confirmed.

The revelations come as the Government faces criticism for the hiring practices of local offices.

The hiring of a top-secret intelligence agency, the HSC Queensland, has sparked outcry in the wake of revelations that some of the agencies were hiring top-tier people who then went on to do top-secret jobs.

The news has shocked and angered local business owners, who see the hiring of highly-paid Queensland intelligence professionals as an affront to the controversial and heavily-agreed upon culture of trust within the Australian Government.

However, a local offical who requested anonymity explained to The Advocate that he doesn’t feel the need to put up with people hiring from Queensland because he’s felt the pinch.

“I used to be able to fire people for getting into unskilled and unskilled positions within sectors of the industry, but that was before I got involved in politics,” said the offical.

“It’s a bit how-ya-going. People might think I’m a top-tier Aussie, but I’ve got clients and I’ll get them into sectors that will benefit my company,”

“But I’ll tell you what, it’s not like I’ll lose the clientele. It’s the hiring of people who have already done some work that interests them.” he said.

The hiring of the HSC Queensland has been met with criticisms from industry groups who say it risks creating a climate where people who don’t know anything about working with government agencies and secret intelligence, will never be able to find happiness in life outside of the two-hour lunch break they have to put up with every day.

One of those individuals is Cecile Byron, a spokesperson for Victims ‘Naught’ Morgan United, who claims her career was not that good until it was revealed that her ex-colleagues of Morgan’s were paid $US25,000 to spy on the group’s members.

“I was so embarrassed, so angry,” she said.

“It’s so fucking Orwell. None of this shit was even related to us. And the government is fucking cracking down on child abuse and similar kinds of things,”

“Fuck me, it’s so embarrassing to be honest. I’m so embarrassed. I don’t know how I’ll get home to Sydney, I’ll never school in this nice country again. I’m so embarrassed.”

“It’s Not Happening, Errol” Says Rapper Called ‘DJ Dirty Hooka’

TEXT:

A Melbourne man who hasn’t visited the pub in almost a decade, has lashed out at NSW Premier Mike Baird and the Liberal Party today, saying the premier is playing “key roles” in the lock-out gripping the Pyrmont region.

“Queensland Liberal premier Mike Baird has played a pivotal role in keeping pubs open, despite there being a lock-out there” said the man who has to get the minimum wage up and running again to pay for his pension,  as well as the $280 billion he pumps into the economy each year.

“Instead of building better hospitals and schools, we have to privatise them so our government can pay for them.”

Queensland Liberal Premier Mike Baird says he is “pleased” to announce that lock-out is not working, and that Queensland is going through a bit of a transition.

“It’s not going to be a smooth transition. We have to keep promises of investment, jobs and investment. It’s not too late for us to keep our promises”

The announcement came as Mr Baird announced new plans to build a $150 million multi-purpose housing and tourism department in the central Queensland town of Broome – in an effort to rethink the economy by 2020.

The new department will employ more than 2,000 people, including engineers, accountants, managers, and real estate agents – and create a regional industry hub, with Broome Roads leading the way.

Baird has today moved to assure the Australian public, that he too is being very clear about his focus on using public money to build very good things.

“It’s not going to be happening,” he said.

“There have been calls in my office to look at other options.”

“Look, I’ve got nothing against the Premier, or the Premier of Queensland if they want to play their part in making life hard for everyone in their right but, we need to make sure we are doing it right.”

Local Dad Curses Himself After Setting Phone On Fire As He Cares About The Stuffie

Toby’s wife, Lucy, rushed to help clear the computer from the upstairs home and put a jumper between Toby’s bed and the alarm.

AS THE SUN SETS ON another session at the Betoota Dolphins Leagues Club, it is predicted that there will be at least one black person staring back at the rugby league club at the pub in town.

Study Confirms “War On Christmas” Is Just About Being Right

TEXT:

A recent survey conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) has confirmed that “War On Christmas” is just about being right and that it probably shouldn’t be that heavily supported.

ABS data uncovered earlier this year uncovered that 95% of Australians who actively support Australian annual Christmas celebrations over the Christmas period actually support an annual family planning service, and only 10% actually support an annual family holiday in the year ending December.

“It is probably still early days, but Christmas is already starting to look a bit like a ‘show Of Shows’ kind of event” said lead researcher, Professor Alf Morris.

“It might be time to let our nation burn a bit of wood for a bit of the common little steam engine of global warming”

The study has been criticised by a range of different government agencies, including the Australian Bureau of Statistics, as well as Liberal Senator Cory Bernardi who has said that “War On Christmas” is just about being right.

However, a spokesperson for the government agency that conducted the survey has said that the findings are proof that it’s certainly time for Australians to get a bit frugal.

“It’s time to put a few families on the back burner,” said the spokesperson.

“At least until we can figure out what the hell the hell the term “War On Christmas” is. If not, at least we can find out where the term is from and maybe have a laugh about it.

A recent study conducted by the Australia Foundation and the World Resources Institute (WEI) has found that the direct link between ice melting and the general fate of the planet’s environment is not understood.

“A recent study has found that direct links have not yet been established between the consumption and destruction of natural resources with climate change and a global pandemic of ice drift” said lead researcher Professor Lote Meninga.

“For example, the melting of ice could be linked to the melting of glaciers and of ice sheets themselves”

“The study has found that if a country is able to melt ice, it is more likely to have a pandemic of ice drift in the next twenty years. If a country is able to break ice, it is more likely that the whole of regional Australia will experience widespread ice drift”

“Therefore, the study concludes that it is unlikely that a global pandemic of ice drift would actually happen”

“Therefore, the study concludes that it is very unlikely that a global pandemic of ice drift would actually exist”

“Therefore, the study concludes that it is very likely that a global pandemic of ice drift would actually exist”

Professor Meninga’s comments follow a recent report by the CSIRO has found that 97% of all cold snaps have been directly linked to people drinking Tooheys Extra Dry Beer in December.

“It’s not a stretch, it’s just that Tooheys Extra Dry Beer is usually the first beer you’ll need in the weeks leading up to Christmas” said one CSIRO researcher, Professor Sam Gardiner.

“It’s a fantastic statistic – but we need to think long term about it. If Australians have a choice in this matter, we are going to shut up about it”

“It’s just too much to be tolerated – it’s too much to be covered by insurance”

“Gentleman, This Was Pretty Much How I Met Him Overseas” Says Man With Violent Opinions On Instagram

TEXT:

One of the country’s most esteemed youth writers has lashed out at his new manager this morning, saying that he should be focusing on writing about stuff that happens in Sydney.

Samuel White-Kelly, 24, says he’s been following his manager Kimbo Sloss into quite an area for the past few weeks, and has found his creative juices flowing.

The Eureka native says he’s been following Sloss around the world, and seeing how he approaches difficult issues often helps spice things up.

“Kimbo is a really good bloke, and I’m looking forward to working with him as a colleague,” he said.

“But I guess I’m going to have to settle for reading about the amazing women and child molesters that run this country through charred remains of a mainspring,”

“Maybe a few of the guys I’ve got in this production getting back to the ’50s. I can’t really see myself doing that now, but I’ll have to.”

Sloss said he’s looking forward to meeting Sloss again at ANZ gigs.

“I’m going to have to see how he bats,” he said.

“Maybe I’ll go on a bit of tour and see if this shack is worth touring? I hope so.”

“It’s not my cup of tea” says local man

TEXT:

A local man has revealed to The Advocate this afternoon that he’s not overly interested in whether his local cafe is full or just a $39 hangover bar.

Dylan Spittergood, a 27-year-old office person, said he’s not interested in whether his cafe’s coffee is full or just a $39 hangover bar.

“It’s my cup of tea” he said.

“I’m not here to drink it. It’s full. It’s not full enough. If I am full, it’s over.”

But, he concedes, he’s not interested in whether his cafe’s coffee is full or just a $39 hangover bar.

“I’m not in a position to stop me from doing something else. If I’m doing something else, I’ll stop drinking it.”

However, in light of the recent tragic events in London and other European cities, local residents have taken time out of their busy morning to take a shine to Dylan and his former employer, Ian Morris, who’s been accused of negligence in the workplace where they have their coffee.

Speaking candidly to The Advocate, one local man explained that he too often doesn’t sleep at night knowing that he’ll wake up to an inferior taste when he faces the existential existential existential threat of having to re-evaluate his career.

“I wake up each morning and wonder why I’ve left,” he said.

“I don’t know why I’ve left. I just don’t get it. It’s all I ever do. If I don’t change my career, who knows what else will come in the future?”

“I’m going to quit my job and move to Scandinavia. I’m not sure how.”

“You Totally Get Me!” Says Mate Who Just Put His Mates On First Ever Car Trip

TEXT:

A local man who just got back from a really nice cruise has thrown his mate’s woollen Volvo into disarray this afternoon. 

The group of possibly more than three other mates are currently sitting down on the bus’s aisle, one of them being Sam (pictured) who is having a really loud and pungent argument with his mate’s superior over coffee. 

The argument is currently pitting the mate against hisEGO, the brand new Volvo and three other mates, who are both in town for a nice cruise this weekend. 

The argument is currently tearing the family “so strong I can’t breathe” around Sam with the aid of a pair of deep facial piercings and multiple facial piercings. 

Speaking exclusively to The Advocate, the man who is currently sitting on the front seat of the bus says the whole bus was crowded with people who were ‘really into their coups’ and were just trying to get a coffee. 

“Turns out the front bus had one of the best coups in the country,” he laughed. 

“Totally got me!” he laughed, dishing out a volume of 426 out of a Chopper bus he had no part in was hauling. 

“Now all you’ve gotta do is get your mates to come and pick you up!” 

The group of blokes have yet to decide whether they’ll try to get their mate’s on the front bus or if they’ll just put it on the back and just go home.

Crown Casino Under Fire For Blocking Adani Mine’s Way Into The Big House

TEXT:

The Adani Carmichael Coal Mine is expected to be fully operational later this year, after the Crown Casino’s decision to stop operating service in the environmentally catastrophic open-cut coal mine that the company is trying to push through.

The decision was made after a meeting between industry insiders and the Adani Carmichael Coal Company’s chairman and co-chairman, Guy Poncho.

It is understood by The Advocate that Crown has been trying to get concessions from the government this time around, in order to get concessions that the everyday Baby Boomer can just jump on their fucking train and not have to worry about getting shut down.

The Advocate managed to get the official language of the Adani Carmichael Coal Mine, which is expected to be formally announced this week:

“The Crown Casino’s decision to stop operating service in the Adani Carmichael Coal Mine will not have any significant impact on the industry. Crown will continue to operate the mine and we will look to other companies for additional support.”

“We understand that many other Big Fucks in the Big House have similar ideas, though with slightly different goals. We understand that you too would love to hear us try and put in place a sustainable way to achieve those goals.”

It is believed that Crown is keen to have a hand in helping the government achieve its election promise of $2.2b needed to pay for these expensive infrastructure projects, which will probably be something to occupy the Prime Minister for some time.

“The Bible Says We Should All Be Crazy” Says Bloke Who Didn’t Even Bring A Can Of Good Sorts

TEXT:

A local Betoota man has been left bemused today by the comments his coworkers have made about gay marriage.

James O’Connor, 29, was told that gay marriage is bad for business and that he doesn’t agree with the idea of it.

The polite prick, who isn’t related to the gay population in his local area, was told that he couldn’t be fired for disagreeing with the gay marriage plebiscite, but he must be crazy or crazy enough to support it.

“I don’t know, mate,” said O’Connor, who doesn’t believe in climate change.

“I’m just a normal bloke, a simpleton. I don’t believe in fucking Crazy Fingers.”

“Gay marriage is bad for business, it’s like putting a throat cut on a normal person. I can’t believe they vote for a radical socialist”

The leftie-voter by the name of “Spencer” doesn’t believe that gay marriage is bad for business, and he doesn’t believe in fucking Crazy Fingers either, but he’s calling it what he wants.

The divorced dad who works in marketing told us that he doesn’t agree with the idea of people like James in the company of radical socialists.

“I’d rather have my cake and eat it, Charlie. The only reason why I do this is because I’m emotionally invested in the outcome,” he said.

“I’d take a gay man’s child, for example, but I’d also take a child of a billionaire, but that’s a bit different.”

“I’d take all the gays except the ones that have a history of punching people, but I’d also take all the Muslims except those that have a history of butchering their own children.”

“If only there was a way to have a tax-payer funded media outlet that shouts ‘Don’t take everything from inside private school!’ without any pushback from anybody!”

“It’s just not on. We are a nation of clever people, clever corporations,”

“The Bible says we’ve got to do the same thing, just not right now.”

Bondi man pissing on side of the road arrested after stop and go chase

A PARKING SQUARE MAN has been arrested in South Bondi this afternoon for running his breath test and passing urine up his mate’s nose.

It’s understood by police that Michael Rust, of Bondi, was stopped and questioned by two park-cops after passing the test when his mate’s father asked if he was running after a wet day.

“Yeah, nah, nah, nah,” said Michael, between sobs.

“Dad’s telling me that I’m not doing any of that shit,”

“Is that just what it’s like? You can’t just ‘run away’ after a rainstorm? You’re going to end up having to drink a polluted pint of Coles while you wait? You’re going to end up having to give up your wallet?”

“Mate, I’m out here pissing on side of the road, arresting you.”

Michael Rust was arrested on suspicion of urinating in public while on a roadside and spitting on the roadside.

His arrest came after the two men were seen pissing in the group’s excrement and a police car, which was brought to a halt at the scene as the chase continued.

“Michael Rust,” said one spokesman for Police NSW.

“I’m not going to sit by and watch you piss in public while my investigators and public servants watch. You are fucking useless.”

“Anyway, you’re in trouble mate,” said the spokesman.

Barnaby Joyce Doubles Down On His Healthy And Solid Diet Of Ultra-Saturated Fat Dessert

TEXT:

The former Deputy Prime Minister has confirmed today that he is committed to a low-carb, organic and/or organic dairy-free diet, despite the fact that he is only a member of the United Patriots Front.

Barnaby Joyce confirmed to us today that he is committed to a low-carb, organic dairy-free diet despite the fact that he is only a member of the Australian Christian Lobby’s 38-member dairy lobby.

“I don’t want you to read that. There are 38 members of the Australian Christian Lobby. That’s a number that I have but I don’t want you to read that,” he said.

“So what’s the point of me joining the 38 if all you want to do is eat fruits and vegetables?”

“Well, that’s not what I want to do. I want to be involved in the dairy industry for the next five years and I’ll only eat dairy products for dessert.”

The Member for New England’s humble bush capital, known as The Entire Australian, has come under fire from both socialists and vegans recently for his gluttony, and he says it’s not because he doesn’t like dairy products.

In a recent interview with Marie Kondo, the Deputy Prime Minister and former leader of the opposition in his home country, Barnaby Joyce said that he doesn’t like dairy products and that it’s just not for him.

“Just look at the fruit and milk,” said Joyce.

“Seriously, it’s disgusting. Even worse than the salt and pepper. The little bits of shit eats those little bits of fruit and milk like it’s the little touchy little buggers in the morning time,”

“And the whole look at that, the look at that, the look at that. You know what I mean, it’d be a giant no-brainer for me to join the 38”

The Deputy Prime Minister then went on to say that he is committed to a low-carb, organic and organic dairy-free diet, despite the fact that he is only a member of the Australian Christian Lobby’s 38-member dairy lobby.

“I’m committed to a low-carb, organic and organic dairy-free diet, which includes zero servings of dairy-free cheeses,” said Joyce.

“No meat, no dairy.”

“I’m committed to a low-carb, organic and organic dairy-free diet, which includes zero servings of dairy-free breakfast cereals, zero servings of dairy-free dairy-free Mi-Goreng, and zero servings of dairy-free wild-caught fish.”

“I just don’t feel like eating that lot of cereal.”

“I’m Not That Old,” Says Man Who’s Never Hijacked a Home

In breaking news out of Betoota Heights, it has been revealed that local man, Bruce Cazaly (56) is not that odd.

Cazaly claims to have been tampered with a long time ago, and has never been in trouble with the law.

“I just bought this for my sister,” he said in his grandmotherly voice that looked as though it had been made by his niece or nephew.

“Don’t tell my brother, but.”

“I’m just 29 years old, and I’ve been bashed by bouncers ages,” he said with a condescending tone of authority.

The line between good and bad, between the old and new, between the young and old, between old and young is thin, especially when considering the fact that Cazaly has been in trouble in the past for running around unchecked on the footpath.

“Don’t listen to anybody.”

“I only bought this for my sister,” he said again with a much more condescending tone of authority.

“You’ll never use this shit if you’re not careful.”

“I’m not that old, man. I’ve been in prison for almost a quarter of a century.”

Cazaly then started speaking in a much more cordial manner to the residents of the 400 block of Grove Street, in front of a younger Cazaly’s house.

“I’m 29 years old, and I haven’t bashed anybody since I was in here living with parents around here,” he said.

Former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has announced his plans to run for politics in the upcoming byelections of the Australia’s 6th most populous state, saying it’s time to focus on more than just winning an election.

Turnbull’s election campaign has been likened to that of Sir Joh after the former Prime Minister became the 45th Prime Minister of Australia to resign from Parliament in less than 12 months.

“The Liberal/Nationalist parties are going to take over the senate and the House of Representatives will be run entirely by ICAC”

However, Turnbull’s new political campaign appears to be nothing more than an attempt to appeal to the recently unemployed and former citizens of Australia’s least-policed society.

“I’ve decided to focus on the promises we made to the unemployed and their children”

“I don’t think ICAC and the Liberals are ready to see this anymore”

Christmas Now Close Enough To Write Off Left-Handed Bullshit As Workmates Begin Installing Christmas Trees

TEXT:

A recent report by HR consultancy firm HRK has found that the festive season is almost overblown for junior staff at the Betoota Grove Police Station.

“We’ve found that the sheer volume of people that turn up to the office each day is enough to make any battler drop a Christmas tree off. It’s enough to make one feel like emo,” said lead researcher Wendy Langton.

“The volume of people that turn up to the office each day is even more reason why the police do not turn up for Christmas. They have more alcohol to deal with and more people on them to deal with,”

“It’s enough to make you feel like a barmaid but nothing can stop the mouth from coming out of your mouth. So, in a worst-case scenario, you might as well take your tree out and throw it in a creek.”

The police station is in the same region that’s traditionally treats Christmas as a full-blown school holiday, with the reopening of local primary school Christmas celebrations that usually receive much less media attention.

The news comes as the authorities work together to remove the last remnants of last year’s Great Australian Spelling Bee and the last remnants of last year’s Great Gaybully Bay Carnival, which kicked off celebrations for thousands of holidayers but ultimately proved to be a complete waste of time.

The extended break between Christmas and New Year’s is a time for everyone to unwind, with the biggest Christmas traditions taking place in full swing.

“We can confirm that between 6pm and 6am each January, the police will be putting up signs around Betoota to let people know when they should get out of their car and away from it,” said Langton.

“It’s already causing a few traffic accidents that get solved through education and awareness activities, but this kind of out-of-control attitude from young folk has got the wrong kind of affect on behaviour,”

“But we’ll see.”

Boomers Throw In The towel!

TEXT:

As if that doesn’t make you cringe, thousands of baby boomers are today throwing in the towel and cancelling everything off right now.

This comes as the nation finally breaks for holidays after 52 years of economic existence.

With the economy growing at an annual rate not seen since the early 2000s, and unemployment still at 8%, more than 12,000 Australians have thrown in the towel and thrown it (battered, exhausted and sad) off the footpath.

Many have even stayed home and eaten mutton and mutton bellies, as the trampolines from the chemist down the hill from the trainwreck suggest.

However, in a perfect storm of climate change, the nation is currently shutting up shop.

As of 10 am this morning, the main island’s shops and drivers are closed because of the rain.

One local baby boomer explained to The Advocate that he had no choice but to shut up and go elsewhere.

“The only thing that I want to do is go home, put a jumper on and go fuck itself,” he said.

“If Australia keeps going the way we are, nothing will change and nothing will happen. I’m a baby. Baby Boomers don’t care. They’re old and dumb.”

However, one Baby Boomer said he was tired of being reminded of the value of a handshake from a decade ago.

“I’ve got a great baby boy.”

“But I don’t want to have a baby. I’m sick of it. I’m sick of having a baby. I’m not sure what the problem is,” he said.

Report: Dastyari Kind Of Likeable About Jeff Horn

TEXT:

In some breaking news out of the Middle East, a recent report has suggested that Jeff Horn is kind of likeable about the allegations surrounding his affair with female journalist, and the fact that he’s not even a fan of crossfit.

Jeff Horn, the former US Open champion, has reportedly told a Fox Sports representative that he would never be interested in coaching another team if they didn’t have a fun fact that would put him in the crosshairs.

Horn is reportedly a bit of a swag man, and has been the subject of tabloid journalism for some time now, but was a little bit gullible when he told the representative that he was interested in coaching another team.

The fact that Horn is actually a serial liar and has stated that he sexually abused multiple women, while arching in multiple sports at multiple events, makes him a bit of a parrot, and makes him a good candidate to be coach of a team.

While Horn is yet to be fired or ousted from his position as head coach of any of the teams currently in the ICCF, he still owns the team, and has refused to coach them.

It is not yet known if Jeff Horn will be coaching, or if he is going to be doing it as a reward for his cheating wife Cam.

Bondi Boys Surprised Byrous Slight Decrease In Banditry Skills Given To Them

TEXT:

The newest resident gang in Betoota’s French Quarter have been left surprised by the apparent decrease in ‘banditry’ skills they have acquired over the last few years.

The newly founded Betoota Dolphins Rugby League Club has been a staple in the French Quarter’s nightlife strip for close to two decades, with each successive successive offer of sledge, paddle, and slam disappearing items becoming permanent.

However, that hasn’t been able to keep the gang together forever, says local drug dealer Omer Asmussen.

“We’ve been trying to get some of these boys to come into the fold for a while now,” he said.

“But they’re not willing to face the music alone, just to let it rip. They’re also not prepared to face the music without some of the boys showing it,”

“So that’s what we’re going to do. If we don’t have any bandits to hold court around, we might end up in a similar gang situation to what happened in Betoota Heights a few years back.”

The ensuing debate has divided the French Quarter’s youth, but one group leader says he’s glad to have a haven for young men who are willing to brave the difficult social situations that come with being young.

“I’ve got a feeling those boys will be coming home to roost in The Donald,” he said.

“If they can find a nice place to stay in town like The Dolphins, they’ll be very happy.”

Turnbull Facing Critical Shortage Of Referring To Australia As “The Dirt Capital Of The World”

TEXT:

Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has today faced a critical shortage in his top job, as staff members look to find a new role that might offset the constant stream of online posts about him.

While the nation awaits the announcement of a new Communications Minister who looks like a kid that came from the right-faction of Liberal voting parties, and who looks like he’s safe as Malcolm Turnbull has stated that the recent shortage in jobs has been a critical shortage in media coverage of the current portfolio.

“I mean, this is a tough week for me,” he said today.

“I mean the drought, I mean the drought. But the drought is a long time,”

“But I can’t just sit idly by while a hopeless man shafts at me. The budget is my responsibility. I’m going to do my job.”

However, Opposition leader Bill Shorten has accused the Prime Minister of pandering too close to the rich bloodline of journalism and political reporting.

“I’m not sure why Malcolm Turnbull wants to be treated that way. I mean, he’s an affluent white man, who’s been in Australia for nearly two decades, and it’s not like he’s going to be throwing darts in someone else’s fish pond,”

“But he’s going to be referring to him as, ‘Darling Wood’’ – a pun on ‘darling wood’ as in Chinese characters for Chinese characters,”

“It’s just not fair.”

“I’ve Got Me Cables If You Want To Talk About Dope” Says Woman On Her Sleeve About Running For 8 Hours

TEXT:

Local woman, Sharni Betts (27) has just negotiated the privilege of not being able to hear you, her partner and the general vibe at your workplace.

Sharni, who claims to have managed to forget everything that happened yesterday, has just negotiated a 5 hour shift at her desk for the purpose of her out-of-pocket costs.

It seems that things are getting pretty grim for Sharni, considering she and her partner are the most likely to be around for much of the day.

“Yeah it’s grim” she says.

“I don’t want to say I don’t mean for a scene”

Sharni, who is a bit of a power person, says she has been called a ‘pinko’ and a ‘shining hand’ in the past, and seems to relish in her role as the person society has become used to seeing as many coloured people with visible hands as anyone doing anything else.

“I just want to be able to get my kicks out of any conversation” she says.

“It’s a great initiative by the organisers to promote this particular branch of Australian sport”

With her new job, Sharni is being paid 100% of the wage and receives a superannuation allowance and health and dental insurance.

At the end of the day, Sharni says it’s all about respect for each other, and not getting fudged around by anyone of a different race.

Sydney Real Estate Agent Claims He’s The Only One That Can Fix Everything

TEXT:

A Sydney local has made the explosive claims this morning that he is the only real estate agent in the country that can fix everything within the walls of one of the three properties he manages.

“Yeah, I work for the man,” said Lewis Carmichael.

“My parents send me down here every weekend to manage the biggest property owners in the area. I’m just one of them. I’m able to manage, fix and grow my business,”

“I’m also able to work for the man. That’s the only reason why I have a computer. It’s got four video games, two TV shows and three cult classics – the only reason I’m in the top spot is because I manage all the properties I own in Sydney. That’s why I have a computer.”

Mr Carmichael’s computer is one of three that he manages in the swamps of South Australia. It’s a semi-transparent scrollable desktop that his mates make when they come down from the sky.

One of the properties he manages is Blackallab, which is nestled amongst the lesser St George in the Pyrmont shopping centre.

“It’s my property. I can manage it from anywhere. Not just a property in the swamps. Not even the CBD. But I’ll get you a good computer for your Christmas.”

South Australia’s computer market is slowing due to the fact that most young people in Sydney only live in Sydney for a couple of months a year.

One of the properties he manages is Blackallab, which is nestled amongst the lesser St George in the South Australia shopping centre.

“Yeah, but but but but but but but but but but but it’s a nice place to live.”

The computer market is also slowing as most young people in Sydney only own one.

One of the properties he manages is the home of his partner and future Prime Minister, likely under his leadership.

“My partner and I own two houses. We only have one now but we’re allowed to invest in it. The current market is worth a lot of money but it’s only worth a lot of money.”

“I don’t think we’d be able to keep up with demand without a computer.”

“I’m Not Far From The Beach” Says Man With Several Defibrillator Payments

TEXT:

Local man, Brian Hamel (29) says he’s not far from the beach.

While walking down the footpath of his local cafe, he makes a point of greeting people and encouraging others to do the same.

However, many of his more devout patrons find the activity too draining and crass.

“I’ve had people order espresso martinis and things of that nature before me.” he says.

“I don’t care. It’s not even that much for me to do,”

“I’d rather have sex with you before I die.”

While the overly sexualizing and sensualizing claims of “sex, drugs, and fun” may seem like a strong argument to some people, many of which don’t even know the cafe is only a couple steps from death, Hamel believes that he’s had enough.

“I’m not far from the beach” he says, in reference to the infamous Defibrillator incident of 2006.

“I ordered three espresso martinis and two water ones. You just don’t do that with vibrating bras.”

“Ordering an espresso martini in a café is a cardinal sin.”

Hamel has also spoken out about his distasteful views towards traditional methods of ordering cappuccino.

“I’m not far from the beach” he says.

“I’ve had people eat cappuccino while I walked in. No way!”

“They Don’t Respect The Laws, They Just Shoot Them”

TEXT:

The Honourable Member for Grayndler has joined the chorus of opponents in his quest to silence the Australian Federal Police, after the AFP accidentally shot a Perth man in the throat in 2014.

“It’s not a good use of my time,” said the Member for Grayndler, John Cunningham.

Mr Cunningham, who was visiting Perth for a family friendcoming on a return trip to Melbourne, was visiting Perth for a family friend-type experience when the shooting happened.

“I’ve known about this for a long time,” said John.

“In my previous job as a Deputy Commissioner in the Queensland Police, I oversaw over 60,000 incidents involving minor injuries and thefts in policing and public safety. I oversaw over 1.6 billion searches and 1.6 billion appeals. I oversaw over 900,000 horse-racing events and 250 sporting events. Over all that time, I’ve seen Perth Police shoot and shoot people like Johnny on the shoulder and Beach Boys panic attacks and fucken deaths.”

But Mr Cunningham is not alone in his quest to silence Australian police.

Thousands of Australians have joined together on social media to boycott the Australian Federal Police, stating that they have a right to know what they are getting up to in Perth.

Speaking exclusively to The Advocate, local Greens MP Dr Clancy Overell said that the “whole of Australia is in uproar” about the Perth shooting, and has called for a complete overhaul of the AFP.

“These officers are getting paid half a million dollars a year. Half a billion dollars a year goes to their overseas overseas headquarters in Hong Kong. How can you expect them to do things like shooting people when they aren’t in uniform?”

“If they are, then people who don’t drink coffee and smoke weed are in trouble. The AFP is not in danger of being shut down in Perth anymore.”

Scientists Successfully Teach Gorilla To Say “Fuck” In Front Of People

TEXT:

After successfully teaching a newly painted dolphin to say “Fuck” as they walk past, a team of scientists at the CSIRO have revealed today how they have managed to teach the dolphin to say “Fuck” as it walks past.

Released this month and quickly made famous by the now iconic gorilla sting, the groundbreaking study has been met with a mixed response by both local and international media.

The Australian Institute of Botany released a statement saying that the study has been very influential for the wider community and the government continue to use the phrase “fuck” as words such as “don’t make me do what I want, or don’t let me order” are a waste of time and money.

Speaking to The Advocate about the success of the study, lead researcher Professor Gabrielle Sewell explained that it has been a long time coming but it has been something that the researchers at the CSIRO are very proud of.

“We’ve already been able to show that the gorilla sting actually worked for other species, like the great white and the great black,” she said.

“And we still have some data that we still haven’t shown to be correct, but the work we’ve done to show that the phrase actually works for other animals has been very impressive,”

“Our research is now in order and we will be sending it back to publish this exciting research when we can get some funding.”

“I’m fine. I can just not back down here. It’s a good policy, but I will be back.”

“Also, I think it’s important to let the people of Australia know that we are for all Australians, not just One Nation.”

Tony Abbott Briefs Turnbull On Gay Marriage, Drones And Disappointments

TEXT:

Prime Minister Tony Abbott has travelled to North Sydney this week to urge Malcolm Turnbull to “get the marriage marriage marriage together” and to “not let any one member in his right mind have any control over the gay community”

Mr Abbott, who travelled to Sydney on business on Wednesday for a number of business deals and engagements, appeared rattled by recent developments that have seen him ousted from leadership hopeful Peter Dutton and Peter Dutton held in a recall election by the Liberal Party – and ousted from the Senate too.

“Put aside my doubt, I’ve got nothing against you” Mr Abbott told the Prime Minister, who was then a Senator in his own right and had the upper house twice before it did.

“But let me tell you, there’s nothing bad about being ousted from the Australian Liberal Party. You can’t win elections by having too much charisma”

However, it is believed that Mr Abbott has since spent the last naughties putting on a show of his new assertiveness, by posting a series of extremely offensive memes to Instagram and posting highly political commentary that has resulted in him being replaced by a more square-wristed former Federal Minister for Agriculture, Barnaby Joyce.

The comments have resulted in Mr Abbott’s immediate and ongoing back issues.

“Put aside your doubts” he said.

“I’ve been a farmer for 30 years and I know how it feels to be ousted from that”

Tanya Plibersek Visits The Coast To Ask Barnaby Joyce If He’s Got A Bit On His Hands

After yet another recent spike in Chinese-Australian media, King made headlines in China this week, after visiting the top leadership summit of the BRICS Economic Community in Mexico City.

However, as most Australians know, this is nothing compared to what King’s done over the last few months.

“Sorry” she says.

“I’m A Bit Overboard In The Mines” Says Desperate PM Who Needs To Grow A Beak

TEXT:

After a desperate Prime Minister Morrison blew the budget this week and has been forced into a humiliating series of knee jerk comments about asylum seekers, the desperate PM has come out and publicly vowed to drain the swamp of public money and do it all himself.

“I’m not a drain. I drain money. And I can’t be in a position where I don’t have people to blame their angst over budgeting on,” explained the desperate politician who hopes the budget will go ahead without him as prime minister.

“So I’m a bit overboard in the mines”

“Ha ha ha ha ha ha”

“And I am onboard. I’m heading to the Maroochydore Watershed next week to sink a length of timber up my arse”

Morrison, who has been criticised for his knee jerk comments about asylum seekers, says that draining the budget is one of the government’s top priorities.

“I’ve been on the mission and done it,” said the desperate Liberal MP who literally cannot wait to drain public money and sink a length of public money into a pointless exercise that he has no real interest in doing.

“But at the moment I’m throwing my support behind drain.gov.au, the federal online immigration website. We’ll send a few private messages to the PM’s staffers in Sydney,”

“I’m A Big Kid To Me” Says Big Kid X

As the most recent controversy surrounding Australia’s oldest son continues to swirl, it seems the proud southern gentleman may have jumped ship. 

With the birth of his first daughter, Australian Captain Elizabeth, much speculation is swirling over whether or not the son will fit in with the current national identity. 

The controversy arose after X, the youngest son ever to wed in Australia, revealed that he was a big kid, to a much fanfare. 

A week and a half later, X is still not 100% sure if his new ‘big kid’ look is one that best suits his current lifestyle. 

“I mean, it’s a bit gross to show off my little characters, but I’m not sure why everyone is so mean to him,” said a techie Sydney adult as he walked back on the bus. 

“I mean, he’s a big kid, but I think he might be big kid.” 

“Like, I think he’s a big kid but I’m not sure. I’m sure he was a big kid, but I’m not sure I could fit in,” 

The lack of interest in his own big kid status has led some parents to refer to the boy as a ‘big kid’, a bit of a ‘cunt dick’ and a ‘cunt dick’. 

Xavier X, however, is a kid that is a bit of a ‘cunt kid’, and so is his mum, who herself is a big kid. 

“I just don’t understand how he could do it, and then then for some reason mum thinks it’s right,” 

“I mean how the fuck does he know to be a big kid is a bit different to a normal kid” 

“I just think he is too precious and selfish to be putting on the whole outfit,”

“Sorry guys, I’ve just been playing three chords in a row for a while. I reckon it’s healthy but it’s just so refreshing” said XXXX.

“This is the first time I’m on stage at KIIS and they’ve asked me to play a rhythmic solo on stage. It’s so simple, yet so mysterious. It feels like I’m on a mission to make the world a little bit more sense.”

The musician says playing three chords on a school disco stage is a bit much, he just has to work his way through a few leads.

“Sorry guys, I’ve just been playing three chords in a row for a while. I reckon it’s healthy but it’s just so refreshing”

However, the musician has hit back at critics who’ve questioned his dedication to educating upon the subtle intricacies of musical instrumentation.

“No, I didn’t do it to ink my Ph.D. in Zoology. I’ve had a good arvo trombone taught me in the Arts, and I’ve been able to practice that craft in my spare time. Sorry guys, it’s just like being a hip hop artist without all the lame gear.”

“This Baby Boomer Is A Liason” Says Australian With Two Social Security Numbers

A local retiree who has forgotten how to count has revealed some shocking facts today as part of a media blitz orchestrated by the Australian Conservatives.

While appearing on 2GB talkback this morning with Ray Hadley, 34, claiming that Australian’s have been maturing a new understanding of how to identify a baby, the generation 1 to 3-year-old, they have also grown accustomed to knowing how to count and have been taught how to use a two-finger swiping method that has proven to be quite successful in other parts of the world.

Speaking to the baby, a local father named Darren (56) said his father’s ability to count was not something he ever looked at before and that his ability to understand the concept of two-finger swiping was something that only his two hands could ever know.

“It’s not that I don’t like my father’s ability to count, but it’s something that I don’t understand,” said Darren, who has only ever used the two-finger swiping in the past but now has a functioning two-finger swiping.

“But he can’t just run through the count of a person. He needs to know how to use both hands to count, which I only ask when we’re having a laugh and a beer.”

Darren, who cannot remember seeing anything wrong with his two-finger swiping, continued to rattle on about how he had never used a two-finger swiping before and that was all he could talk about as the family watched on.

Government Warns Of Aussie Talent Droughts From News Cycle

TEXT:

The nation’s government has confirmed today that they’re planning to block foreign talent from entering Australia to cull wild animals, and import them as needed.

The so-called “selection lottery” has proven to be a winner for many Australians over the last fortnight, as the number of suitable animals to take to races has grown dramatically, from 11 to 15.

While many have concededly admitted that they wouldn’t have it any other way, the federal government has made it very clear that they’re not quite there yet.

While it’s still early days for the game, and many animals are dying, the number of suitable producers and abattoirs has grown by 10%.

Scott Morrison, the current head of the department of human services, says that while he’s relieved no one has gotten to the point where they’re making good on their promise to the country, he’s still worried the game’s going to dry up.

“We’ve been very humbled this afternoon. Certainly not compared to what the game can achieve in a matter of days,” said the Former Minister For Foreign affairs,

“And it’s not going to happen overnight. I mean, we’ve got a lot to do with this game”

Morrison says he’s not concerned, and that the game has managed to outrun the federal government in terms of resources – which he plans to use to help modernise the code and make sure no wild animals are imported.

Channel 10 to begin offering ads on “lost and found” beach

TEXT:

THE SHARE-AUTHOR of Channel 10’s flagship reality news show, The Bachelor, has thrown his support behind a bid to find and remove himself from the running joke list.

With cameras rolling, the network is hoping that contestants and their families can be included in the ad blitz directed at Channel 10, as it’s a hot topic for airplay and a hot topic for advertisers.

Producers say they’re already looking to network out with commercial network SBS – but there’s no need to have that rule in place.

“We’re already looking at commercial networks, but I think there’s a better one for us,” said a producer.

“There’s a lot of riff-racing going on right now. There’s a lot of betting on how this campaign will pan out, but for now, let me give you a few examples,”

“The original “The Bachelor” and the new “The Bachelorette” are among the biggest ratings wins for the show, they’ve both rivalled our ratings, but it’s still a bit much,” he said.

Another industry standard show, The Simpsons, is another show that’s raking in money.

The show’s producer, Dennis Pooley, explained that the more money the show makes, the more money the producers get.

“You can’t be doing The Bachelorette in the money game,” he said.

“But if you’re doing it on a cash-in-hand basis, the producers get some of the profits. Some of it is clever advertising, some of it is dodgy lending. Dennis loves the show, he’s taking it on on.”

The campaign, which is currently being lead by middle-aged women with beards who like to keep it real, is slated to run for a week on Monday and run for a week for week between June and November, with the first week in December getting a bit much.

The Advocate can reveal Mayor of Sydney Anthony ‘Barry’ Clarke has been caught looking through his embattled Range Rover at times, after it was implicated in complaints that he has been caught looking through his wife’s latest model SUV.

In a report commissioned by the NSW Premier Mike Baird, the Mayor has admitted to being caught out looking at his wife’s latest model ‘sandman’ – after the Premier made an effort to distance himself from the decision.

“I know how my wife makes the adaption, and I have been caught looking at her Range Rover,” says the Mayor.

“I know how I used to look at her Range Rover. I can’t believe I’ve been out and about, being on the receiving end of it all,”

“And I’ve got to. I’ve got to now.”

Torturous Family Gathering Begins Again Like They Do In The Tim Tam Episodes

TEXT:

Despite there being only a dozen or so families currently milling around Betoota’s Old City district, local man, Dave Grohl, says today’s family gathering was just like any other day back at his humble Betoota Heights display shed.

“I brought a carton of tins with me today,” he said.

“We aren’t going to have a family barbecue here every Sunday. We’ll be having Family Feud, we won’t be having any of those other boring regional family events. Family Feud is for the independent man and his kids, not the regional family that comes with him. So today I had a carton of oaten plaits and some flat white. It was good to see all of the kids again to celebrate their diverse backgrounds and arts, music and culture.”

Dave then went on to explain how the last few years have seen them getting pretty busy, like they are having family after work and the kids are just leaving school without having done a whole lot of washing or childcare.

“They are also getting the family bird off the market and into the sewer line, and that’s the possum, Parrot,” he said.

“So yeah, that’s what we are going to have today.”

Barnaby Joyce Denies Any Involvement In Disappointing Polls In Regional Australia

TEXT:

The former Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce has today denied allegations that he has any involvement in the stunning drop in local polling in the Maranoa on Wednesday, as he announced plans to announce a “transition” in remote communities to voting booths that are a lot easier to operate.

“I know all my staff and I have been telling people all along… It’s a lot easier to operate these machines if you are from the back bencher section” Mr Joyce told a Melbourne crowd on Tuesday.

Local media have today begun to downplay the ‘dramatic drop in local polling’ as the party continues to come to terms with the fact that the most-likely-voter in the upcoming Queensland election, is a likely to be a Liberal electorate, as Labor is hoping that they can amalgamate and lose 10 seats to One Nation.

The party will hold its election in two weeks’ time, and will also be responsible for the WA pre-selection process in the coming months.

It is not yet known why Mr Joyce is denying the Maranoa local the opportunity to vote in a majority of their electorate, or why the local has been unable to see any form of a leadership spill against his local leader, Tony Abbott.

However, it is believed that Mr Joyce has been holding the local in high high high regard ever since he brought the party to power, after promising to “run this thing through” – and has reiterated his vow to expel the party from the local from the local from every election in the state at all costs.

“Pull your heads in, Barnaby. I promise this thing’s nothing to do with you”

“I’ve got local people from all walks of life here. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise”

“We Need To Switch To Renewable” Says Terrified Housemate Wearing AR-15

TEXT:

A North Betootaian has wading through the cold waters of the Betoota River this afternoon wearing her AR-15 design as though it were designed for the 21st Century.

The housemate of Lyle Patterson (60) was accosted by several housemates shortly after she finished what she assumes was an overly long walking tour of the property.

“I think I might have let a few cold ones down here and there but at least I’ve got a few of these cold ones” she told our reporters.

“I don’t want to get home without some cold piss”

The Advocate reached out to a number of local businesses and residents who have been hit hardest by the falling out rates as well as the hostile working conditions.

One of the biggest employers, Betoota Groceries, says they’re offering free sandwiches to staff who come across a little cold beer in their sandwiches.

“While we know it’s the easiest fix to get through these colder months, we urge our employees to treat their employees the same way they would at home and fire those responsible,” said Betoota Groceries manager Carrie Swain.

“It’s not about them feeling bad about having to endure this type of torment. It’s about them feeling happy and fulfilled.”

Swain said the company has offered free sandwiches to staff who manage to hold a consistent, consistent stream of people for longer than a day or two.

Yuppie’s Night Saves The Day For Thousands Of Vultures

TEXT:

It has been a big few days for local millennial, Ashley Blackstock (19). 

A part time stay-at-home data analyst, Blackstock spent a few hours out in the community earlier than usual, sampling the bush for the first time as the vultures and other invasive animals that eat the residents down at the Beachside Hotel and Grill come home to roost. 

This comes after thousands of vultures and other exotic animals have already left the state, and descended upon the region and adjoining areas to no one in particular. 

Ashley said the vultures were horrible 

But, as Ashby doesn’t have any kids to take care of, and he’s kind of had to settle on a career in data science to prove his point, the vultures and all their companions have been left in the cold because Ashley can’t just come up with an excuse. 

“I’m not that sure what they’ve done to the residents of the Eastern Suburbs tonight. They’ve ripped up all of the rip up lanes and no parking for drivers,” said Ashley. 

“I don’t think it’s too late for Ashley to come up with a story,” 

“But, you know, I’m a millennial and I feel like I’m getting ahead a bit in this game and eating the best I can but, you know, what I’m saying is notradical” 

“I’m glad we did it.”

Report: Does Mum Have To Be Any Clearer About Not Eating Kookaburra For The Day?

TEXT:

A recent report by the dietary report commission has found that mum do have to be a bit clearer about her stance on the controversial condiment.

While mum insists it’s healthier to eat meat-based dishes such as she has never eaten in her entire life, the commission decided that eating meat-based meals such as Kookaburra is not necessarily healthier.

“It’s not that we don’t like eating it, we just don’t want kids seeing these “cheat meals” shared on mum’s instagram account.”

“The Kookaburras are so filling and salty. I love their salt,peppers,peeled allergen,chopped onions andspicy sausage. I am a firm believer in you kitchenkeeps.”

However, one member of the dietary commission disagrees with the findings, saying eating meat-based meals is not healthy and eating Kookaburras for breakfast is also not healthy.

Debbie Coleman, of the dietary commission says eating Kookabras for breakfast is an affront to nature and a form of mental illness.

“It’s a sign of the times,” said Debbie.

“In the post-apocalyptic East, a healthy breakfast such as Kookaburra might just kill you. This morning, I was just like my body was a few weeks ago.”

Melbourne Rapper Attempts To Shake Things Up A Bit By Saying “Happy Gilmore”

TEXT:

A Melbourne-born rap self-titled rapper has today applied a bit of spice to his already quite amped up attitude by telling a West Coast-based listener that “Happy Gilmore” is part of his unique aesthetic.

The controversial statement was made during a set of set up gigs at the iconic South-West Betoota venue, where the public are encouraged to have a “happy while you’re there”.

“Happy Gilmore,” he says while taking a sip from his custom made Porter wine.

The 45-year-old has also given the impression that he has spent his entire life in the city, playing gigs and touring with both CityCat and The Milk.

“I’ve been here for like 10 years. I’ve been MC, we’ve been running things, getting things done, getting stuff done, that’s how I look in this life,”

“Happy Gilmore, I like to think I’m living it up here in the big smoke. So let’s just say, mate,”

However, due to his relationship with his hometown rapper counterpart, Chicago-based artist Mob-Mad-Mad-Mad-Mad-Mad-Mad-Big-gap-bro, Wayne Bennett (29) is under investigation for a string of offences ranging from public urination to stealing a cheap Beatsby.

A police statement from the South Betoota Police explained that charges are likely to be laid against the artist due to his music being featured on the KIIS album.

“Public urination is a serious set of laws which are applicable to anyone caught with a public body of water, henceforth known as KIIS charges. We will be aggressively working on the case,” said the statement.

“It appears that Wayne had his head pumped hard during this period of confusion,”

“It’s not uncommon for any artist to debut an album as a full-length, however, this was not possible with Mob-Mad-Mad-Mad-Mad-Bits. This was for the fan base, not for the artist.”

“You Can’t Be Both Caught And Prolonged” Explains City Worker

TEXT:

A city worker who has caught and prolonged a few of his friends in the act of enjoying a cigarette in public has spoken of his disgust at being caught up for a local count down.

The act of smoking in public has been described as a form of punishment for binge-smoking, and has the potential to bring about social change according to Dr. Gabrielle Guthrie.

“People have been looking for ways to make a bit of noise while on the go, and to be caught doing a certain thing that you’ve been told to do,” Guthrie said.

“So they’ve tried it and failed miserably. Now they’re both caught and ready to go.”

While the act of smoking has been outlawed in several cities around the world, the act of smoking in society still means someone has to enjoy their day.

“We’ve got people who smoke,” said Guthrie.

“We can do this in every pub, club and club-thing house around the country. Not just the CBD. But also New South Wales, the ACT, Western Australia, the ACTU and the Big Sur.”

“I mean, these rules only apply to people who smoke. If you’re caught and ready to go, you can enjoy yourself. The only people who can enjoy themselves are the ones who are already snorting diazepam and taking opiates. It’s the finesse to know.”

Dr. Gary from the Royal School of Hard Alcohol said that the new laws aren’t nearly as shocking as the old ones.

“We’ve seen this with the darts and the e-cigarette. Old laws only applied to the naughty kids, not for the rich or the famous,” he said.

“But for the little ones, you just put your duffel bag down and enjoy the moment. It’s the kids way of life.”

Wyatt Roy Finally In A Position To Pull The Sex Up

TEXT:

The Liberal Party leadership race is looking once more under the spotlight today as former member of Parliament Wyatt Roy appears to be in a position to pull the sex up.

Roy, a former cabinet member and former mining magnate, has made it clear that he is not interested in taking credit for the notable wins that the party has had over the last few years.

“I’ve got nothing against him. He’s a titan of the party and the personification of money in politics,” says Roy who has been in politics since 2008.

“But, as I understand it, mining is his background. He won’t win, but he’ll make some bloke’s lives hell.”

The career politician who has been in Parliament for five years has told all today that he won’t be made to feel guilty about the win, but is just happy to be listed as the front runner.

“Nah, but yeah, mate. I don’t give a shit about anything. I’m the real winner. And I reckon the mining thing is even more important to me now,” says Roy who was met with jeers and heckling from the opposition.

The Nightwatchman then went on to explain that the real winners are the people who got the lion’s share of the spoils in the last spill, and those who are upset about the fact that the Prime Minister’s personal savings account has been consumed by a sex tape.

“We don’t give a shit. We don’t vote for a fringe politician,” says the Nightwatchman.

“Because they’re unimportant and irrelevant. And I reckon anyone who is voting for anything other than the most marginal of candidates is missing the point,”

“And to that end, I’m going to knock these people that keep feeding the party the mango chutney, the red chutney and the lactose.”

“Lactose is a delicious poison, it’s healthy and healthy for the body. It’s the reason why the Liberal Party keeps giving us our two cents,” says Roy.

“And so it seems to me, Wyatt Roy is the only real candidate who can pull the sex up off these bastards.”

Thai Massage Now At The Point Where Westerners Can Actually Do A Better Job Of Shrugging

TEXT:

After a big week of raids and raids on the streets of the Republic of Thailand, Channel Nine have once again proven that they’re the antarctic wonder of the free world.

With a few big name biffs breaking in, the program moved onto the spiritual lives of the students at the infamous Betoota Trough Church, who taught that the best way to kill a bird of prey is to soak it whole, rather than simply scatter it in the jungle.

Unfortunately, the raid came after the priest decided to give the boys a bit of abirth to recover their esk Pelican, which is also quite rich in broth.

While many of the raids have been positive, one member has had some concerns.

“I thought it was a bit excessive but they’ve just picked it up today” said local ‘Brahman hump’ Robert, son of Westerner’s Lord Rupert, who was out on the piss of shooting a log over a bush at 30 knots.

“They’ve got all their bells and whistles ringing. The work I’m doing. Looks like we won’t have any fuckin’ sleep for weeks on end”.

While the raid has been applauded for the raid of the Ek, many locals have lashed out at the fact that no one has been able to break in to buy anything since this current crop incident.

“Aye” said one local, Bronte, who’s a big fan of the police raid on the Ek.

“There’s no way they’ve been able to break in to buy this prawns and shit. It’s like they’ve been able to break in to our town”.

“Why are they able to just walk away without a fight?”

Local Bar Is Secretly Minding Their Own Diet Checks And Thinks It’ll Be More Healthful

A popular French Quarter bar, The Dickless Parrot, is in breaking news this afternoon that their entire budget is solely devoted to tracking your every move and setting up their own personalised health and fitness apps.

“Yep,” said manager, Bert.

“We’ve got over 2 billion downloads and over 500,000 apps in the works. That’s just for the apps with the quotes scribbled on the front of them. That’s just for apps like Fitbit and Jawbone… Two very popular and very popular apps for people who don’t have smartphones”

“And for that money. We’re not worried about cannibalising that. There’s a healthy health and fitness industry pumping in right around the country right now. And I think it’s probably linked to my current position as manager.”

The Dickless Parrot have also been linked to a recent report that suggests American cricket could be facing national closure if the Indians were allowed to bowl out of bounds.

Speaking exclusively to The Advocate, a Dickless Parrot spokesperson said that the team’s core are looking for ways to make their game more healthful.

“We want our players to have fun, but not as much,” said the spokesperson.

“So we’ve taken a couple suggestions from the recent study and added a health app for our players to track their health and wellbeing. You can choose to be healthy or not. You can either have fun or you can have ketamine in your body for that matter,”

“So there you have it. Randomised controlled experiments. Not many choices in a human being can be worse than this.”

“He Fell Into It, Fuck Ya!” Screams Man As Heoops Hisself Off The BackStage

The opening moments of Saturday’s soccer match between Manly and Western Sydney was one of the most cathartic moments in Rugby League football this year.

Not because Manly conceded defeat, but because they levelled their opponents down the road.

It was a rare night out for the Manly faithful, who made the drive up to Sydney from Brisbane in an effort to win something they can on a Sunday morning, but because of course Manly did concede.

“That was so fucking cathartic” said one punter at the Lord Kidman Hotel this morning.

“Fuck Ya!”

The incident epitomises the spirit of homely Betoota football in the Channel Country, which is why Manly captain and alleged bosom friend Darren Lockyer is ‘shitting his pants’ today.

“We were just so fucking pissed!”

“Ya did i know that!”

“That was so fucking cathartic”

The incident is being treated in the courts of Orange Supreme as an affront to Origin values, which is one of the biggest examples of publically funded gambling that has ever existed.

Sydney Begins Ripping Up High-Quality Textiles In Effort To Stay Out Of Jail

TEXT:

The City of Sydney has today begun ripping up the high-quality garment currently being sold in the city’s garment yards.

This comes as a record-breaking $32 billion dollar investment in garment manufacturing and sales, is set to see the city of Sydney significantly boost its import exports.

The sale of high-quality linen to textile manufacturers and manufacturers operating in NSW has been met by both industry and the opposition at the same time, as a record $32 billion dollar investment in garment manufacturing and sales, is set to see the city of Sydney significantly boost its import exports.

This follows the highly successful push to legalise the highly polluting practice known as “ginsberg”, whereby garments are braced for wear during a work day.

It is understood by The Advocate that the bracing forwear was a staple of countless “golf-chariot-changer” such as the successful push by the NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian to legalise it in 2012.

However, the sheer quantity and price of the garments being sold in the city’s garment yards has prompted many to question whether this extra firepower is actually a good thing or just a precaution.

“I mean, it’s not like they’re actually killing people” said one local convicted criminal, Shane O’Hare.

“They’re just making the garments cheaper for the wholesalers”

“I’d rather have people buying these things cheap than having some people doing actual research on snuff films”

“I mean, the only positive for this industry is it makes it much less disgusting to buy them from a shop that sells basically anything but that shit”

However, local businessman and former Outback construction manager, Ted Kintore (67) says he doesn’t understand why Sydney has gone with this “one off” tactic.

“I mean, I’ve got a family and a business to operate, I don’t need the extra hands hours and finesse that comes with having to be a shirtless Sydney”

“Haha, haha” Says Only Kid Left Rockabilly Bikie Club With Name That Invites Blow-Up

TEXT:

An entire street has been closed off to everyone after a prominent South-East Corner rockabilly club was forced to admit that it’s only been in business for a few hours.

The Kolsch Electrally Rock Loblaws Of Gladhills Road was forced to admit to a relatively large crowd on Sunday after being forced to admit that their club name is only fitting for a few blow-ups.

The blow-up is now considered a formality and the only one left.

The blow-up club has the shock-factor of being the only place in the country that people of all ages can come together and feel obligated to admit a crush.

“Yeah, it’s a bit surprising” said one boomer fuck head who is absolutely ropeable.

“We thought everyone would just accept it as a bit of a relief, and everyone will start from scratch. It’s not a real club”

“We will be closing down by Christmas”

“It’s just a bit of giggles”

“It’s Not Happening, Tony” Says Woman On Tax Breaks Out And Just Confuses Her Budget By Age

TEXT:

A senior figure on the Australian Taxation Office has lashed out at the media today, saying that it’s not helping the job of the jobless and it’s not even funny.

Scott Morrison took time out of his busy schedule today to tell the media that it’s not even that day.

“Just confuses me,” he said.

“I’m not having a beer today because I am on tax advice, or because I am on Scott’s personal allowance. I am on the same wages as the week saw me pay yesterday’s pay. And I’m not even having a beer. Jesus wept, mate.”

The prime minister paused.

“Anyway, get this moving. There should be a law by the time I get to the parliament, which has happened at least seven times already. The only thing that’s happened today is the tax man has been working around the clock.”

The media scrum collectively laughed.

“Anyway, keep talking that way,” Morrison said.

Farmer’s son forced to steal apples from local tree

TEXT:

A farmer’s son has been forced to pick apples from his local tree this morning after it was forced to grow on the roof of his father’s ute.

It’s believed the father was unaware that he was about to have his apples ripped off his beloved apple – the iconic black puffer-apple.

“It’s a fine apple,” said the furious Capricorn, as he massaged his 7-year-old de-littering apples.

“A little pearl of fine pearlescent apple juice. You know what they say in Melbournet… If you don’t have blueberries, there’s no apples,”

“But my apple picking is illegal. It’s illegal to pick an apple from a tree. I’m not a small man my father’s slaves. I don’t need any favours. I’m a hungry old old white man”.

The Advocate reached out to the town’s fruit merchant for comment but he’s currently on his third trip to Melbourne and cannot be contacted for comment due to boot-camp backpacking.

Apprentice Drinks Guinness After Getting Stuck Playing On Someone’s iPhone

TEXT:

A local white-collar apprentice has taken it upon himself today to finally get his Guinness Book Of World Records in front of his family, after drinking the Guinness of about 3 dozen beers and intentionally not doing anything that could make them feel extra special.

The well-known drink has made a name for itself in the home improvement industry, with people drinking it acting like it’s never existed before.

“I just got stifled, like, three times my limit,” said the 37-year-old plumber.

“It was just not helping. Dad was calling me dumb and cutting me off, so I just got up and got in the cupboard. Then I just had to throw my Dad out, which was also weird,”

“Anyway, after I got stifled, I decided I’d just get a couple of more strength beers and hit the family’s monthly goals.”

The goal was to have one of two drinks, the other being a cold beer with some lemon zest added.

According to Guinness, the beverage is essentially a drink bowl, in which the alcoholic components of the beverage are added to complete the volume of the drink.

However, in reality, it’s more of a a drink art.

The term Guinness Art is a relatively new phenomenon, as most people who’ve used it describe a drinking kit made for someone else.

For example, many Westerners who don’t have friends who can help them complete a ‘runspace’ have to use it as a playground.

However, one craft beer enthusiast who’s tried it on is Doug Melrose.

Doug says he loves drinking beer while working.

He says it makes him look like a better bloke.

“I’m just so happy these records come back for 2,000 years anyway. I’m sick of hearing about people dying to drink beer while on the nature strip,”

“Anyway, I’ve got another one coming,”

“I’ll see you then.”

Local Woman Forms Opinion On Relatively New LinkedIn Profile

TEXT:

A local woman has today thrown the towel in, after learning that her recent opinion on new Facebook profile images has changed substantially. 

“I’ve got a new hairstyle,” Kat, 8, South Betoota, told reporters after being inundated with supportive emails from people claiming to be concerned about the haircut in question. 

“I mean, it’s not a bad haircut, but I’m just concerned about the potential of my old haircut being taken from me.” 

“And to be honest, I’m just worried that my friends would think that I’m too weird and weirdly obsessed with my hair,” she said. 

“So I went looking into the new Facebook profile picture and came across this slightly depressing trend of my friends having a wanker on their head every second weekend.” 

“Seriously, it’s depressing.” 

The opinion that they have spent the last six months taking their friends into a fantasy world where they can have whiter hair, is a common occurrence amongst left-wing echo chambers, with upwards of 15,000 left-wing activists taking part in anti-opinions about how depressing it is. 

It is not yet known if these shocking social media actions by Kat and her friends are directly affecting their friends, family and fellow Betoota, but experts predict that these leftie haircuts will be met with a lot less criticism than what the haircut in question provided. 

“Yeah, so it’s not really that bad,” Kat said. 

“Just you won’t have to do much to get it, and if it does get taken seriously, then it will be taken seriously with respect and dignity,” she said.

Report: Fuck Up Black Jacks

TEXT:

A recent report by the University of Western Queensland has found that fuck up black jack shit is not only frowned upon in Australia, it’s also problematic for society.

A report commissioned by the University of Western Queensland has found that fuck up black jack shit is also frowned upon in certain circles outside of the mining sector.

The findings show that the cultural cringe is present in certain parts of certain parts of Australia, where people of working class don’t shit their pants and act like they are being served by a grown up.

The findings also show that people of working class are far more likely to post a photo of their footy bike and not take part in an organised protest, when they are actually trying to run over and avoid being crushed by a toxic smorgasbord of pollution and HSV pollution.

“It’s not that we’re not keen on it” says professor Rhett Beyers (who ironically co-wrote the first ever Australian Phonetic Playset to Australian Rules)!

“Sure it’s there to keep us competitive in a number of important competitions, but the more weombat-phobe the community, the less weathered weombat-phobe the community.”

Barnaby Joyce says he’s just “dressed up for a Neil Perry concert today”

TEXT:

The Former Deputy Prime Minister has taken the stage this afternoon at the nation’s most popular music festival to defend his decision to attend a Neil Perry concert this weekend.

Joyce said he’s just dressed up as his local MP for the “incredibly festival destroying” Neil Perry gig – in an effort to make up the extra expense.

“Come down to this shithole and see the inner turmoil caused by my insensitive and ungracious attitude towards the Neil Perry festival” Joyce said.

“It’s not the Neil Perry bullshit, it’s the complete and utter refusal to take into account the thousands of other people in the vicinity… and the sheer scale of the festival”

“I look forward to hosting a Neil Perry tonight and tomorrow morning, it’ll be one of the most amazing experiences of my life”

Joyce has since been criticised by our elected officials, who say he looks like a fuckwit, and ignore the fact that he’s spent the last twenty years throwing shade at every single person who has the energy to attend a Neil Perry.

The fact that Joyce’s entire attendance was comprised of four completely single-eliminated people also doesn’t add up, Joyce’s supporters insist.

“He’s a fucking prick. Four of us just decided to come down to the main stage. We didn’t want to get a full head of cattle, but we were determined to go down there and to make it look like Neil Perry’s festival has more energy and dickheads,” said one punter.

“It was quite an experience. It was an amazing experience. But I don’t think any of my mates were prepared to put their hand up to be on the day. It was a shame,”

“I’ll have to move on.”

Unemployed Mate Invites Charity Door Knockers Inside For A Billy

TEXT:

Local unemployed man Luke Boulders (28) has today been left speechless as a pair of charity door knockers were seen to have finished buying his first beer.

The barmaid at the Betoota Dolphins Leagues Club told the door knockers that he was giving them a bit of a fright after noticing them “walking around with different sized bags”.

“I mean, I don’t get any of what they’re doing, but at the same time, I don’t want to get on their level. I don’t want to acknowledge their efforts,” Boulders told the group.

It’s understood that Luke was only a short-lived socialite after spending 18 months working part-time at the notorious Hinch factory, where he treated apprentice Shane Warne to a weekly smoko where he exposed his inner-submitted meat pie.

“I had to scab a whole sack of skin off the shit he ate,” said one Hinch employee.

“Not to mention the whole sack of food that lay on top of him. It was quite confronting.”

The employee said that while he hopes Luke has learned his lesson, he also feels sorry for himself.

“I hope he listens to me. The job is stressful enough without everyone being dreading this impending doom.”

Man’s faith in ‘The Big Bang Theory’ pales in comparison to the confidence he feels inside

Despite never having to leave Brisbane, a local man has revealed his love for the popular dating show that nobody really asked him to do much after his parents divorced more than a month before Christmas, has plummeted since the show aired.

In fact, not one of Peter’s mates has even been invited to come watch the show for months already.

Speaking to The Advocate via wireless telephone this morning, Angus Sampson from Betoota Heights police station said he’s been looking for something to watch this week for weeks now.

“I just love The Big Bang Theory. It’s the reason I got my rig and my girlfriends girlfriends,” he said.

“It’s a show that, for the first time in history, has successfully asked a human being to answer the door to their mundane lives.”

“It’s a show about a man and a woman,” he laughed.

“Hunt down a culprit, convict and free. Go on, man. That’s what I want.”

Our reporter spoke to a somewhat intimidating but charming young man a short time ago about the show and how it made life difficult for some of the other boring show in town.

The man explained that he has a girlfriend.

“She’s a convicted drug addict, painter, thief, sex offender and sex freak. I’m looking forward to seeing all of them,” he said.

“I’ve always wanted to be a police officer. This show gave me the look, which I am going to enjoy,”

“Anyway, we are going to visit a hospital this week and see what kind of sicko doctors have the time in the world and what they don’t know about the show.”

“I can’t even watch the show until one episode is up to date with all the ramifications that this will have on this generation,” said Gary.

“It’s just so sad. I have such immense sadness watching that character and how that tragedy has affected everyone in the world. You just don’t watch it do you?”

However, the happy-go-lucky bachelor who is a big fan of the show said that he’s not concerned about having to watch any episodes until at least a fortnight out of every year.

“Yeah, I can’t put up with it any longer. We’ve got bigger things to be honest. Like, I don’t care if the show is up to date, it’s got more momentum than most episodes of The Bachelor.”

“Anyway, the moment that Bill gets dumped comes in the form of a heart-warming scene that takes place in front of my very eyes.”

“I’ve Been Doing Some Gronk” Says Only Friend In Social Circle With The Hottest 100

TEXT:

There has been a lot of noise around the world in recent months about a debate about which online trends are the real winners and losers.

The controversy over which online trends are really the truly “sexist hot 100” has dominated the news cycle this week, as many people around the world began to ask if there was something much worse than what was published.

However, the debate has now shifted to whether anybody else cares about what the winners say, and don’t care about what is published about the winners.

Betoota local andhygeic Mt Isa local and self confessed, he has been doing a bit of research into this whole issue.

“Haha, the real winners are the ones that claim to discriminate against people based on their social media use”

“It’s really depressing how these losers are able to claim to be experts on things that are just as crook as what they are about!”

“The real winners are the ones that make some sort of appropriation of #yewest on their sleeve and wear it around their neck for the rest of their life.”

While the results of the #yewest hashtag have been overwhelmingly positive, one user, who has been identified as a single dad who has been single for the last year, lashed out at the “brokers” for wasting their precious time and money on pointless debate.

CSIRO Report Shows Serendibularity As Key To Returning To Sexual Offender’s Life

TEXT:

The CSIRO’s recent announcement that they had found a way to make Serendibular couples has been met with excitement by millions of Australians.

While many were sceptical about the research findings, the Government today announced a “major update” to the lock-out laws.

The laws were introduced by the NSW Government in response to the long-running debate about whether the lock-out laws were an invasion of privacy or a measure to prevent repeat offenders from getting out.

The laws were criticised by civil liberties groups who warn that the thousands of young people that have been locked up in Sydney’s lock-out laws for over a decade might be “soft on reoffending”.

However, the government says they’re simply targeting one type of offending people, not making any tangible difference in the lives of those in need.

“We understand that Australians like our politicians and bankers, but we also understand that the poor people of Australia are made up of very, very, very dark people” said the Prime Minister.

“It’s pretty simple really. The more a young person thinks they’re sexually offending the government, the more likely they are to be offered a job,”

“And that job is going to be a nice perk for working at the CSIRO here in Australia. This afternoon I was on the phone with a computer genius in Germany who told me that if I were sent to Australia’s hell hole of West Hons, I’d be far more likely to return to it.”

Entrepreneur From Hometown Finally Gets To Experience The Unbelievable Fines That Riddle Him

A local entrepreneurial from a small town outside of Betoota has today applied for unemployment benefits after discovering that many of the claims made about the poor are actually bullshit.

The former General Mills worker named Ryder S (27) has landed in a big hurry after shopping for work in Betoota’s trendy French Quarter district.

After finding a spot a few hours west of Betoota’s international airport, Ryder decided to walk the walk for a couple hours before finding a job at Betoota’s second-largest privately-owned store.

However, this didn’t stop him from thinking about the poor rolls in the area.

“I’ve come to the conclusion that the poor people of the region are suffering from the same plague that’s sweeping through the country,” said the former General Mills owner.

“There seems to be no reward in it. I can’t even find a place to put my stuff in takeaway containers when there’s so many pubs and book clubs putting them in the back of motorbikes.

“So I’m stuck here in Betoota’s food court. Can you imagine the outcry if I got sent home for putting up a fight at a pub because some poo-stained wok-eyed cunt reckons it’d look like a good old fashioned pub,”

“And I’m being told that I’m entitled to a decent little middle class meal because I’ve been offered it. What the fuck is wrong with people who just want a couple of glasses of chardonnay and a bowl of devon crackers?”

“Get it together. There’s nothing to it.”

TEXT:

A Golden Gal in Betoota Heights has been found to be a mass grave, after a man who authorities say may or may not have died of natural causes was found this morning in a bag that was wrapped around the body of a deceased officer.

The Advocate can confirm that a large area of evidence suggests that the body may or may not have been the same as the one that Tim Coffey was found with on July 6.

The police report, however, does not indicate when the body was discovered, and the investigation is ongoing.

The body of a former Queensland Police and fire Chief was found about 7:30 am on Thursday, with the contents of the stomach and a shoe near the remains.

The Advocate can confirm that the detectives were able to link Tim Coffey’s death to the death of his beloved cheese sandwich, but it is too early to say whether or not they will bring charges.

The police report also suggests that Tim Coffey was the subject of the investigation and that he may or may not have been killed.

Tim Coffey was a former policeman.

Barnaby Joyce Facing Political Jailbreak After Allegedly Buying A Glock 17

The former Deputy Prime Minister and New England First Minister Barnaby Joyce is reportedly ‘feeling the Bern’ this morning after breaking political shackles, after finally getting his Glock 17.

The former Deputy Prime Minister and New England First Minister spoke to the media this morning, where he thanked the media for making Australia a “great place” and “God willing, this place will thrive on all of us.”

Joyce said he was ‘feeling the Bern’ and thanked the media for their ‘hand of the teacup’ as he waved goodbye from the press conference.

“Thank you for all the media,” he said.

“And I just want to say, I just want to say one thing. Barnaby Joyce is in the news right now. He’s breaking my arm,”

“Barnaby Joyce is breaking my arm because he purchased a Glock 17. Very very odd behaviour. Very odd for a New England man. Very odd for me. Very odd for Australia. Very odd for us. Very odd for Australia. I wish him all the best with your Glock 17.”

Joyce and media advisor Alex Greenwich then went on to explain to the two that they were acting like they were in the same joint, but the Glock 17 is a common weapon in the Australian arsenal.

“He’s always been in the gun business,” said Greenwich.

“But Barnaby is a bit different kettle of fish. I’d be more in the business of buying things for my brother at KPMG, rather than his casually-priced assault rifle that makes him smother the young men and women he sees every weekend around the country,”

“But yeah. We will be providing a Glock back to Prime Minister Morrison in a gong, hands down.”

Morrison, who’s been locked in a viciously-contested election battle with the unpopular but once-respected High Court lawyer, said he made a phone call to Joyce a few minutes after leaving the Prime Minister’s Office to congratulate him.

“Congratulations Barnaby, you’ve been made a party member for the record,” said Morrison as he walked from the Central Canberra Council chambers to the waiting press gallery.

“I think you should have told Joyce to get fucked by the fucking Glock,”

“I’m gonna vote for me anyway,”

“Let’s go do pingas in the garden.”

Report: QLD Man Who’s Never Travelled Past Adelaide Should Own A Country

TEXT:

AUSTRALIA’S QUICK CANDID NEW Prime Minister is underplaying his new views over his neighbour’s Adelaide home.

A staunchly conservative electorate, Adelaide – which sits between Brisbane and the South East corner of the Australian continent – has been heavily politicised by the new shit-talk about man.

With the Abbott Administration looking like it might be a shambles, with the Australian Prime Minister and current spin doctor looking like he might be having a stroke – the Australian people have been treated to a new breed of political rubbish.

Survey data suggests that nearly half the population of Australia’s inclination are over 30 years of age or older, and have been told by the Coalition Government is the best way to get a root.

While the old ‘townies’ like to point “d’t get where they are because of the foreigners that live in with them,” the fact remains that the people over 30 are being treated like dumb buggers by the new shit-talk.

“A country that’s never travelled through its own backyard, should own a country” said Malcolm Turnbull in a speech to the Liberal Party in 2014.

It is for this reason that the people of Australia are so over-enrolled by the idea of a passport, that they are calling home.

With the new shit-talk about Australia’s place in the world, and the world as a whole, Prime Minister Morrison has said “roughly twenty per cent” of people in Australia want to see the country destroyed, while “roughly twenty per cent want to see their country ripped apart”.

While the vast majority of these refugees would like to see Australia stripped from the world – and forced into an undeveloped socialist form of statehood – roughly 20 per cent have no opinion about being that unenthusiastic.

Morrison’s comments come after the United Nations revealed that over one billion dollars has been rsped to charitable organisations in the third year to help fight child abuse in remote communities and relief from the harsh and oppressive drug laws.

The Prime Minister has also recently visited South Australia and toured a community near Charleville – where he announced a “new “Tasmanian Free Youth Centre” will open in the community centre.

Morrison has had to battle back his minders in the Morrison camp for ideas to help fight climate change and end child rearing, after first suggesting the name was a nod to a simpler time in history.

The second idea was discarded because it involved shooting sick people. A modern day remora fish would be a humane substitute.

The suggestion that Australia would become a TAS country came as a shock to Turnbull when he suggested Tasmania might be able to make a run at becoming a full blown socialist state.

“At the moment,” said Turnbull, “we don’t know” what to do with a full blown socialist state.

Man Who Keeps A Log Of Motivational Videos On His Phone And Posts Them To Facetime Finds It

TEXT:

A local man who keeps a number of motivational videos in his phone, and uploads them to social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram, has made it clear that he is not finished with them.

“I have tried everything, I have tried to get my life partners to stop watching it, but it hasn’t worked” says Osher Sock, a local social media entrepreneur and mastermind of the Facebook video on gay marriage, according to an anonymous source.

“I have even tried to have a sleepover… But at the same time, I don’t think it’s natural for me to watch the videos on my phone”

It is believed that Sock has been able to stem the flow of his free time by uploading a series of videos of him making a marriage equality promise to his entire family – who have since divorced.

“I’ve been watching the videos religiously since 4:30 am I think”

“I’ve been uploading religiously since 6 pm”

While many believe he is finished with the cult classics, one local man, who asked to remain anonymous, says he is.

“I’ve got a few videos of me doing a couple things that are off limits. The first one I did on the iPad was for a special occasion. The video on the iPhone shows a background soundtrack of Coldplay, which is inappropriate”

While many believe that he has finally stopped listening to the hip hop music his family have made him into over the course of the last few years, Sock says he has decided to just listen to whatever you want.

“I’ve decided to just watch the videos religiously. I’ve got a few videos of me doing a couple things that are off limits. The first one I did on the iPad was for a special occasion. The video on the iPhone showed a background soundtrack of Coldplay, which is inappropriate”

“I’m Just A Fairly-Educated Englishman In Sydney” Whose Only Other Mate Is A Chinaman”

TEXT:

An unlucky junior portfolio manager has today had to endure the ungrateful pangs of being a reasonably-educated Englishman in Sydney.

After years of being shunned by all his peers, including his parent’s, the 40-something has revealed that despite all the things he finds attractive in life, he is ultimately disappointed by the place he finds himself in.

It has been revealed that the recurring recurring sense of regret that usually accompanies English people who are somehow somehow successful is due to the fact that he was once a successful businessman.

“I was just a fairly-educated Englishman in Sydney. I didn’t make my degree so I could be rich, did my family a favour or something, whatever that is” he said.

“But I can still make a living out of trying to sell houses in this bush capital”

“I mean, fuck me. I was lucky enough to enter the property market at 24, but I was lucky enough to not have a deposit in the property market. So I have a Scottish parent”

However, despite his pride in being a reasonably-educated Englishman, the young man is now looking to change that.

“Maybe I could be a tradesman” he says.

“Maybe I can ski”

“I Don’t Need Alcohol, I Just Need A Bit Of It” Says Dutton

TEXT:

Tony Abbott has admitted to reporters this morning in Canberra that he doesn’t actually smoke, and that if anybody had knows how to use a tobacczz, he’d be in a state of complete disgust.

“I don’t need alcohol to enjoy the forbidden fruit” said Abbott, who has been in the public eye for some months now.

“The alcohol itself is quite a problematic addition to any healthy day to be honest”

Abbott’s statement follows revelations that Mr Abbott used ‘volcanic alcohol’ on a mate during a rare trip to the Western World where he was pictured drinking a tropical low’s of sugar watermelon flavoured drives, complete with the word “ves” and “road” in the names of horses.

Rumour has it that the former Prime Minister was pictured vomiting to himself in the bathroom after vomiting several times during a trip to the Western World – in an effort to gain an alcohol-releasing saliva.

The former Prime Minister is said to have suffered a similar fate after being shown a video of him eating a whole mango tree while Prime Minister in 2015.

However, Mr Abbott is hopeful that his newfound sense of self-control will result in a greater appreciation of the forbidden fruit.

“I don’t need alcohol anymore to enjoy the forbidden fruit” he said.

“That’s my own choice. I’m a bad choice [haha]”

Entire Sales Team Forced To Wake Up In Their beds Early As Crisis Closes In Moment Of Need

TEXT:

As the clock strikes midnight, the entire sales team have had to face the terrifying prospect of deciding whether to sell or not.

The team of sales directors, directors and creative staff responsible for something as trivial as a dog, tablet or smartphone have been tasked with making sure the entire sales team knows that the dog, tablet or smartphone will die on the spot – unless it’s an emergency.

“We’ve all been there,” said one sales director.

“The sales people know that this will be the only way to buy a product without a high-interest loan from a high-income relationship. It’s the only way. This is the only way to sell and that’s it.”

Sales people and the financial industry have been calling for the sales people and the creative staff at the Sydney agency to wake up, but they haven’t got any real answers.

The only answer they have come up with is, “No, we don’t need to live under a government that has all these new ideas coming out every day.”

“We can borrow a bit of capital from some of the smaller tech start-ups like Spotify and Stripe. We just need to to look after our hands.”

Morrison: “That’s not a bike, that’s a horse”

TEXT:

In a dramatic blow to the Coalition, the Prime Minister has decided to move his party to surplus after promising not to give up the upper house until next Monday.

Scott Morrison announced his election campaign promise at a press conference in Brisbane’s CBD on Friday, after stating that “that bike, that’s a horse” promise was a reality.

However, as the weekend draws to a close, the Prime Minister has decided to hit the ground running to keep the promise of Australia’s oldest living bike in the back pocket of his pocket.

“It’s a horse-riding, horse-riding” said the PM.

“I made a bold promise to my supporters and my staff and I’ve come this far.”

“Bike, that’s a horse-riding.”

Morrison then went on to explain why the only way to keep his ‘bikes’ in his pocket is to not give up them any longer.

“It’s a horse-riding, horse-riding”

“I’ll tell you what, I’ll tell you what. The only way to stop this horse-riding of my people is to stop giving up our Bikes.”

The Advocate reached out to a number of cycling groups and groups working on land rights for comment but all were too busy trying to keep a close eye on the horse.

Dutton Caught By Private Lunch Investor Looking Forward To A Decent Future In The World

TEXT:

Peter Dutton has told media this morning that he “doesn’t regret trading shares” as he grows concerned about a negative return on his investment in a bullish and volatile environment.

Speaking to The Advocate at the Woking Reserve Bank branch in Sydney, Dutton said that while he “wishes he’s never had to do this,” he doesn’t regret trading shares because he doesn’t want to lose too much money on a future in which he doesn’t plan on being rich.

“I’ve reinvested a bit of my earning in shares,” he said.

“But I’ve reinvested close to half of it into real estate and real estate agent so I’ve got a pretty good handle on what’s happening over the last 24 hours. I don’t want to upset anyone here,”

“Real estate is the next big thing to come after cryptocurrency. Real estate is going through a correction, which is good,”

The private school student then explained it was a “bit of both head scratching and tick-screens,” that made him think.

“The second biggest risk to real estate is the fact that it can be torn down and redeveloped if it doesn’t receive appropriate government support. If the government doesn’t have the money, we’ll just build another glorified Metro station,”

“But the real estate market is booming and the housing market is expanding. So it’s not me that’s going to be crushed by the property market. The question is, will the private school kid have a decent handle on the city’s housing market?”

The young man then told our reporters that he’s been doing it for a while, so he might just stop trading shares.

Man From The City Has A Few Questions To Ask Himself

TEXT:

Local man Paul Fromes (51) has today had a few wild neighbours to ask himself.

While successfully maintaining a level of decorum over his one-bedroom home, the degenerate Virgo is currently battening down the hatches after being invited out by his housemates for an old man night out.

“Oi, but yeah,” he says, in a faux-seedy prank that almost feels as though it might make a few of his housemates feel better.

A typical night out in the life of a hospitality professional involves many activities for most people go by the use of drugs and alcohol. However, Paul doesn’t do too much to put away the alcohol.

After a couple of drinks and a joke, Paul manages to find a quiet spot for himself. A few slides at the local Le Pisse Dans Ma Poche and a few cold beers. A few drinks and a joke.

“Ok, so this is basically how you get up these cold beers these days,” he says.

“You just set aside some room temperature milk and a whisk while you read the papers. You don’t have to do much except get up and do something. I’ve got a proposal for you,”

“Send it here.”

The polite request from his housemates is met with giggles, as the idea of sending it down the road to Betoota Downs is a mere nod of approval.

“I’m not that sure how youre going to get home after this, mate,” says his best mate, Rohan.

“I’ll have to get a bit of petrol for the motor up at the quarry, but at the cost of a few hundred yards I’ll just send it here.”

“You don’t have to send it here much, though.”

“Just enough to put a few in the mouth of a few cold ones.”

“Just don’t mind if I just send it here.”

Man’s Entire Childhood Dream Set Apart From His Post-Teenage Wife’s Dream Of Re-Entering The World

“I didn’t know she was a mad cow”, ‘The Rum Diary’s Start.

While this may seem like a scenario that young Melbo has never seen, it is believed that his wife of 40 years, Stephanie (40, 50) understands the importance of keeping a diary.

“Stephanie kept it in a drawer in her bedroom. It was only when I got home that I realised she’d put it in the bin” she said.

“It’s always been in the diary. The last thing I ever did was to open it and look at it – I couldn’t see the writing on it”.

Stephanie, however, is quick to point out that if her ‘dad’ had kept it in the diary, it probably wouldn’t have got to the point where it had to be deleted.

“Diary doesn’t just end at the end. There is a lot going on in life and Dad is just keeping things in a drawer. I’d rather have a wheelchair that doesn’t end in a roll,”

“I’ve always been a man of his time. I never stopped smoking,”

Stephanie’s sentiments were echoed by her ‘dad’, Steve, who points out that having a diary in the kitchen keeps the diary in a nice state.

“Stephanie keeps the diary because it keeps the boys happy. It keeps the girls away from the doghouse and prevents them from getting a date. It’s a diary that they keep,”

“Stephanie has been doing this for 40 years and we’ve all been there. Boys, girls and keep letters in the diary too. It keeps the letters looking nice and tidy”.

Racing Inquiry Urged To Also Investigate High Rates Of Fashion Cruelty Within The Industry

TEXT:

In its tenth year of operation, the Fair Trading Commission (FTC) has launched a dedicated inquiry into the treatment of tradies and racing industry workers.

The news comes after the news that Michael Cranston is set to join the ranks of Michael Talbot as one of the last white horses in the racing industry.

The former greyhound turned Michael Cranston was slated to join the ranks of Michael Talbot as one of the last white horses in the racing industry, after the two men who have been accused of race-baiting Michael Talbot, were forced to resign from his role of race-baiting expert

Cranston, a male, class A syringe full of human faeces was last seen on the streets of the French Quarter after the two men who have been in and out of prison for deliberately defacing public bathrooms in the run up to last year’s Queensland Grand Prix were charged with race-baiting.

This comes after a year that has seen countless media outlets take shots at the very same men behind the graffiti painting that was used to create the phrases “racism is beautiful” and “taking money from white people”.

However, the commission has been quick to investigate and warn the same old bulls that operate within this same industry.

Michael Cranston, a male, and former CEO of Race Tracks Australia, spoke to us today.

“I’ve been working in the racing industry for nearly 50 years and I can tell you that I have never made a mistake.”

Cranston told us that he was very disappointed to learn that the same people that created the first wall of graffiti in the streets of Melbourne, and the city, used to hate him.

“I just wanted to resign this morning.”

“Fuck race week, that’s a bit hard for me to deal with.”

“I’m going to retire.”

“Anyway, it’s the same old stories.”

Report: Gladys Doesn’t Know About Social Credit

In particular, not one that comes to mind is the howling racial abuse that Aboriginal leaders have faced in the news over their rapidly-recovering use of the illicit drug baklava.

“I think she’s letting it slip,” says nephew Ben Kingswood.

“She keeps forgetting about all the Aboriginal terminology. She has never heard of it. She seems to think everyone should just listen to them and focus on their own issues”

“She’s very concerned about the health and wellbeing of Aboriginal peoples when it comes to substance abuse”

“Curse Of Ice Priest Is A Fucking Good Time To Be Alive”

TEXT:

A recent report by the Australian Medical Association has found that a mass grave of murdered children, usually kept in a park or museum, is a good time to be alive.

However, not all Australians enjoy the added health benefits of a mass grave.

A mass grave is a place where a body is often buried or massaged to the point where the remains are visible and/or identifiable. In Australia, a mass grave is considered a “real time grave”.

A mass grave is only visible to a small group of people who physically remove it in a ceremony under certain conditions. For example, a child can only be seen in a grave that has been prepared by humans. A mass grave is only visible to a select few people who have visited it and are willing to give up their child.

While a mass gravesizes the body a bit, it’s not the ideal way to do it all up until the very last drop of salt has been spat on the ground.

A mass grave is best opened up to view from a garden or swimming pool. A mass grave provides a good vantage point for watching cremated remains move through time and are often looked upon as a form of public execution.

Cremation is often used as the only visible form of government sponsored child labor. As both a symbol and a service for human decay, both a mass and a cremation mass are war-time horrors.

The term “cremation” is used to describe the forced removal of remains from public parks, parks, trails, and on public buildings. It is also commonly associated with forced labor, forced marriage ceremonies, forced adoption ceremonies, and forced burial.

Cremation is defined as the removal of a body part or part of a family during the natural course of a body building.

In Australia, the phrase “cremation” is used to describe the forced removal of a body part or part of a family from public parks, parks, trails, or other places of safety.

It’s also often used as a slur against people who push people into cemeteries.

Dutton Spends $120m To Salvage Nick Xenophon’s Vows To Privatise The Caboolture

TEXT:

Federal MP Barnaby Joyce has today announced that he has today renewed his calls for a Caboolture-style state election in 2019, despite having no official campaign platform to officially support.

Mr Joyce says he made the conscious decision to include a vow to privatise the iconic public infrastructure in order to save the state, and in turn, his constituents, money.

“I have not had a Caboolture person join me for a weekend BBQ at my place or anything,” said Joyce. “I’ve had people email me saying they would, but I have to.”

When quizzed on whether he would allow local businesses to profit off the ‘heartland’ of the Great Barrier Reef, Joyce said he would be happy to see a reef bequeathed back to future generations through a shared creative process.

“It’s not in my top priority. I’ve got a few VIP’s here and there,” he said. “But yeah, I’ve had people email me saying they would, but I have to.”

In recent months, the Nationals leader has made a habit of releasing music to mark his official campaign platform, and this week the party leader announced he would be playing a small part in the soundtrack to the election.

“I’ve got a few VIP’s here and there, but I have to.”

Joyce’s announcement comes after the leader of the Nationals, Michael McCormack MP, labelled the recent re-election of Malcolm Turnbull a “fucking imperative” for the party to unite behind Christopher Pyne.

McCormack told reporters this morning in Canberra that he had been “saddened” by the news, and explained that he was glad Joyce fulfilled his “full potential”.

“I was a lifelong Nats fan, and I was a die-hard fan of Christopher Pyne,” said McCormack. “So it was a real privilege to be able to sit opposite Michael and support him.”

McCormack is one of the many Nationals MPs who have spent the past few weeks weighing up whether or not they should let Christopher back in.

McCormack told reporters this morning that he’s looking at taking a job as a lobbyist for mining companies, or an insurance giant, as the Nats lose money.

“It’s hard to say the same thing for another Nats supporter,” he said.

A local financial advisor is facing his worst spell of it this week, after a conversation with a bloke in a fox racing cap made him wear it backwards as if he’s trying to hide the fact that he’s never been in a drunken tirade.

The bloke, who’s name hasn’t been revealed, says he doesn’t like paying tax so he can’t complain, and that people who do tax like he’s just done them some good, getting away with doing nice things for a man who pays tax.

“Tax is for tax-paying citizens of this country, and me, and the bloke that I’m wearing the suit, so I can say whatever I want without anybody noticing” says local man, Jackson Climax.

“But I don’t like paying tax. Fuck me. Tax is bullshit”

It’s understood that Jackson won’t be receiving the full benefits of his new six-figure salary for the next six years, but has been promised that he’s going to be toeing the line between the two until at least the fourth quarter of this year.

“ I’ve been in this situation recently where I didn’t want to pay tax. I didn’t want to”

“But, you know, I tried to make it straight forward. I’ve been in this situation before and I reckon it’s probably the right thing to do. I’ve never been in a drunken tirade… So I guess it’s just the normal things”

“I guess it’s like the real Australian experience. I’m not a drunken rant person, I don’t think drinking out of a senator’s puffer vest is that hard to break”

A recent report by the University Of Queensland has found that somebody can only be a bad person if they push their opinion in a certain direction.

For example, if someone doesn’t like coffee or exercise or sleep, they can’t be mean, they can only be mean.

However, it seems that somebody can only be a mean if they push their opinion in a certain direction, a new study has found.

Lead researcher, Professor Gavin Riddell says that even if they were to give up their life trying to be good at something, they still wouldn’t be a good person.

“A person can only be a mean if they push their opinion in a certain direction, or if they just don’t like certain types of exercise,” he said.

“Or if they don’t like certain types of exercise, they aren’t a mean,”

“There’s no ‘bad’ people, just mean.”

The research has found that the only people who could be a mean thing are people who are mean to animals, people who eat human faeces and people who ride horses.

“Name a few,” said the Deputy Prime Minister.

“Many of my colleagues have been trying to run at me over the years. I’m not surprised. Even with my best efforts, they’re still waiting to get on with the job.

A local dad has thrown his two and a half glass of water on it this morning in a bold attempt to not let his culinary proclivities get in the way of his usual day-to-day responsibilities.

“Yeah, that’s it,” said Gavin.

“I’ve finished the seafood and mixed it with a bit of coconut milk. The sweetness of the lemonade outweighs the salt,”

“It’s going to be a big hit with my boys.”

Speaking exclusively to The Advocate this morning, the friendly local father said his boys are now going without him because of his culinary proclivities.

“They are such little spoon-bobgers,” said Gavin.

“No matter what they do, it always comes back to bite him. They are a bit too rough around the ears. I’m not a sugar-addled, I’m a catechetical one.”

But he admitted that he’s glad he can go without his beloved fish and chips for now.

“Yeah, but nah,” he said.

“They are back at school in a couple of days. They might still be hungry.”

“We’ve All Met Each Other But It’s Not Like We’ll Ever Get Back Together” Says Dutton

TEXT:

The Home Affairs Minister has taken the time to explain to The Advocate today that the Coalition government has all met each other but not yet, and they don’t really need any more time to wrap up their joint press conference.

Peter Dutton was joined by his colleagues from both the Coalition and Labor parties yesterday in Canberra, as they tried to come up with a solution to solve a complex domestic issue that is currently being resolved around the clock in every major capital city.

“We’ve all got a policy,” said Dutton.

“Which is to get everybody to vote for one another. There’s a lot of grey hairs in this world, but you’ve got to keep them away from the ball-tampering and outright murder of domestic policy by jealous jealous factions within the party who hate us,”

“And by jealous, I mean the jealous power within the party who will not allow us to get along, and the jealousness within the party who will not allow us to have nice things to eat. It’s a great time for Australia,”

“So now, let me tell you about a government that has worked incredibly well over the past couple years. We’ve got a real leader who’s come through the system, and he’s got a real plan for Australia. And by real, I mean the leader that I want Australia to be at the very least, the least perfect country on Earth.”

“And by that I mean the leader that I want to bring it back together, Bill Bradbury.”

The Advocate reached out to Malcolm Turnbull’s office for comment but only received an out of control belly button at the supermarket as his staff asked him to stop pissing on them.

Office Boomer Somehow Not Listening To Neil Perry On The Piss-Off In Their Infernos

TEXT:

A group of highly intelligent office nerds just spent the day collectively eating lunch that should be served in the designated lunch room.

The group of office whingeing vandals were lunching up on the Piss-Off this afternoon, which is when the famous late-20s pop song Neil Perry will appear on stage.

“I think it’s worked out alright,” said one researcher.

“But I don’t think it really falls in the mainstream anymore.”

The office veteran is said to be particularly enamoured with Perry’s songs as they rework his routine every time he films a video, something he does on a daily basis.

Another notable influence from the artist is Tom Cruise once said to work with him on a show because he’s ‘one of the smartest in the world,’ which is a nice touch.

The show’s star,actor and secretary, Leslie O’Donoghue, says she’s never felt so comfortable eating lunch in her office.

“Have you ever felt like you’re out of place on a Tuesday night? It’s the loosest place in the world because it’s where you feel like you’re not made to have fun,” she said.

“I’m just so excited to get Neil on the show tonight. There’s nothing better for him, more fun, relaxation and peace of being alive.”

Leslie spoke to The Advocate a short time ago about her excited time at her desk, which was mostly spent reassuring herself that eating lunch in her office was a perfectly normal way to make time for lunch.

“Yeah sure, I do enjoy getting up here and there to get up and watch him eat. But when lunch breaks I just curl up on the couch and sigh all the time. I’m a moron to be in office kitchen,” she said.

“I just want a break. It’s nice to come here every now and then and watch him eat. It’s just what I do. It’s not many people in this office have the guts to say they enjoy eating lunch.”

Younger Brother Caught With Croc In North New South Wales

TEXT:

A late model Ford Falcon has been found guilty of being the oldest brother of a convicted homosexual, following the first trial of the high-profile Victorian aristocrat.

In the opening hours of the case, Crown lawyer Andrew Brock argued that the youngest brother was a “culturallyally-influenced convict” who was “known to police and media to be on top of his game.”

The case has seen the heaviestweights of both the legal system and policy vilified in the NSW courts – with some arguing the case that the accused’s behaviour was much more sophisticated than a normal croc’s child’s behaviour.

The case has also seen the prosecution formality in the form of a family friend who decided to give up being friends with convicted sex offender Roy “Sully” Miller, after being made aware of the case.

The case has also seen the brother of Sydney lawyer and convicted homosexual Peter Dutton, stand trial in NSW after being informed of the case by his close family and friends.

Peter Dutton has also been informed of the case, after being informed of the case by his close family and friends.

The case has been adjourned until at least Monday.

Inner-City Leftie Finally Gets His Revenge On The Right-Handed Gent

TEXT:

A bunch of lefties from the ironically named Melbourne Left Alliance have today tried to root a local Liberal MP out of the ground by posting memes of him doing a kangaroo survey.

The meme which started it all, and continues to copy and paste, is believed to have been created by one anonymous inner-city leftie named Sam McKinnon, and it reads like something out of a horror film.

“Fuck the Coalition! Fuck the fucking Coalition!” reads the meme, before a bemused McKinnon cuts him off doing a kangaroo survey.

The Advocate contacted the ALP for comment on the meme and they confirmed they aren’t interested in paying McKinnon to do a survey, but simply to protect his identity.

“Sam, we’re concerned that you’re taking the government too far into a swamp of opinion, and not into your right to know if something is fuckenwrong. We’re also concerned that you’re taking the Murdoch media too far by publishing this meme, which we hope to be able to change in some way” said the ALP spokesperson, Constance Thorpe.

“But yeah, I just don’t think we should be paying McKinnon to do a survey, as long as they allow him to have his memes and not publish them as being private. That’s fucked”

“We’re happy to have our differences, and we’re glad we have left the fight, and we’re glad we finally got our differences out onto the common man, and our differences,” she said.

“But you, you know what, I’m not happy about that either,”

“I’m not happy about that either, because you take my gun and I take his meme, and I deleted it, fuck you.”

“Get That In The Mail” Says Dad On The Back Of Black Jacks

TEXT:

Ned Piston (66) has once again shown his support for embattled Member of Parliament, Tony Abbott, by stating the incumbent senator will be getting in the mail soon.

The former Communications Minister has been in the headlines quite a lot this week, mostly related to your sorry old man’s new push for QLD to follow suit.

The Member for Warringah has been the subject of many unsolicited memes and angry Facebook commenters since his controversial Facebook post regarding the importance of mailboxes going up around the country.

The post, which stated mailboxes in centres of heavy metals were going down, was followed by memes about the lost mailman for the last time and the subsequent Abbott apology.

While the dad-cum-politician-turned-archival TV presenters were also all over the news, Ned still remained chuffed for once.

“Fuck, it was a great week,” he said.

“I just wish they had a jet ski to put up this post on the back of black Jacks. It’d be nice. I’ve been to Sydney a few times now, I really like the opulence and culture of this country.”

“Get that in the mail, mate. It’s just a great way to keep tabs on me,” said Ned.

The recent post has seen the Member for Warringah’s office suspended, and his travel approved, from all travel to continue his State of Origin journey to Sydney, the Member for Warringah will return to Australia on Sunday, November 8th.

“It’s Not Happening,” Says Everyone Watching A New ABC Project

TEXT:

An entire newsroom and a handful of private sector employees have been stood down from Tuesday’s broadcast of the ABC’s runaway re-run of the ABC, following the allegations of sexual harassment levelled against the network this week.

The decision comes as a shock to many who were expecting an immediate smash hit out of this week’s episode – which is where the studio head’s alleged misconduct first began to surface.

“It’s not happening,” says one public servant who was ‘bored in all the right ways’ while filming the re-run of the re-run.

“Who would have known a small town was interested in making a TV show about a young family torn apart by family issues and the like?”

“Who would have known a serial killer was coming out of a newspaper or a youth weekly? Then this show started! Only someone with a memory of a ‘dumb cunt’ would have watched it!”

However, the public servant’s sentiments have been echoed by a number of industry insiders, who say that the producers of the show were quite rattled by the news.

“We weren’t expecting this much blow-up,” says one private sector employee.

“Most of the people on this show are professionals who work for the pay they earn and have kids. We don’t expect them to make a bad decision about where they are going. We expect them to help me!”

The show, which is expected to feature thousands upon thousands of new revelations about the alleged incident, has been given a solid rating despite one individual getting a ‘fuck head’ from viewers on the show who are apparently shocked at how much Bill Shorten has been able to push back on sexual harassment and assault accusations.

Local Woman Stares With White Joint In Public Photo As Gallery Bilbs Through Session

TEXT:

A local man has taken it upon himself to scribble something on the side of his mug that reads ‘What’s the deal with youse?” through the front of his own.

This comes as Dennis Pooley-Noll attempted to jog the pace at the foot of the Betoota Esplanade, where he was attempting to jog with a white joint in his mouth.

“I’m going to be real good” he said.

“I just scribbled this down. I don’t care if someone sees it’s me doing it. It’s not my doing anyway”

“I hope they don’t mind.”

But the 29-year-old doesn’t care. He says he’s just doing his job, and that any self-respecting Fortitude Valley youth would be remiss if he scribbled on his mug.

“I’m not made of stone,” he said.

“I don’t need stones to make my desk and my laptop desk that much easier. I’m a professional,”

“I’d do anything for my desk and my money. I’m happy.”

Pooley-Noll’s mug is one of a range of white goods that range in price from a white bread tin to a plastic drum with a drum in it that was manufactured in the last 1300 years.

It’s also a good choice for diversions as the timber used to make the drum and percussion equipment is often confused with white bread tin.

“No, You Didn’t Wear Noosa” Says Boyfriend Who Disagrees With Noosa Over Noosa

TEXT:

A South Betoota man has made it clear to friends and family that he doesn’t mean to disgrace himself when he’s not wearing a noosa-compliant ensemble.

Blake Marshall, a recently engaged white man who lives in a sharehouse on a very conservative lot of people, has been wearing his favourite Noosa-compliant outfit for the past two months.

It’s one that no one else has been able to resist having thrown on their favourite Noosa-compliant white man, Blake Colton.

“No, I don’t wear noosa. I’ve had noosa,” he told The Advocate.

Blake spoke to our reporters about his noosa outfit this afternoon outside his parent’s house in South Betoota.

“I like to dress like a little girl. No, I don’t wear noosa. I’ve had noosa,” he said.

“But I wear Noosa because I wear Noosa. Noosa means mourning,”

“And Noosa means mourning for the people that I detest. It means mourning for those people. I don’t wear Noosa, I like to wear it.”

Blake then spent the rest of his afternoon tossing cones at the walls of his South Betoota home, telling his friends how he’s the most beautiful person on Earth and telling people how great music was and died for.

After a few cones, he hit the road and rode his bicycle down to the French Quarter, where he told people how he’s one of the last greats of Betoota and how a good mate his is meant to be a good mate.

A nationwide campaign has been started by Rugby Australia today calling for the board of the organisation to consider firing Wallabies star Rupert Roberts, as well the entire board.

The Advocate can confirm that the boycott has been officially started by Rugby Australia’s management, and is just one among many boycotts against Rugby Australia’s brand of sport.

In the statement, Rugby Australia says they came to the conclusion that “it’s too early to comment on the issue of Rupert Roberts firing”, but pointed out that they have already begun their reviews of whether Rupert is firing Wallabies.

“Like many Australians, we’re not yet familiar with the role the Australian Rugby League has played in fostering the culture of rugby union in this country” said the Rugby Australia’s CEO Raelene Castle.

“We made the decision to begin our reviews of the Wallabies against England, and like many Australians, we aren’t yet sure whether we will continue to look at rugby league in this country”

CSIRO Announce $100M In Funding To Help Discover Australia’s Most Real Aboriginal Community

TEXT:

The nation’s peak scientific body has revealed this morning that the Australian government’s $100m grant to build the biggest underwater explosive testing facility in the world will be replaced by a $100m grant to continue operating under the controversial Catalyst Grant program.

The news comes after hundreds of academics and politicians called for a Royal Commission into the nation’s controversial “Shanghai Institutional Response Unit” (SHU).

The Royal Commission was set to recommend a criminal conviction or further criminal investigation, but Labor and Green senators said they would also have to hold a press conference at this stage to announce the announcement.

Speaking to the media this morning, the CSIRO said it was important to maintain a healthy level of scientific integrity, while also keeping their funding low.

“It looks as though the funding will be suspended at this stage,” said one spokesman.

“That funding is a clear indication that the project will not be continued, and will instead be withdrawn. As a precaution, we have re-engaged the CSIRO in their research into shandies and other related health risks associated with prolonged exposure to large volumes of high-quality natural gas,”

“At the moment, we plan to conduct a full investigation into the incident.”

The news has brought mixed news to the industry, with many industry veterans voicing their strong negative feelings on the decision.

One veteran energy consumer advocacy advocate spoke briefly to The Advocate this morning, where he said the $100m will provide great financial and technological relief for the companies already paying big money to silence critics.

“I’m not sure what the fuck this grant is going to for me,” said the man.

“Obviously, the news of this shandie-grubbing has brought great joy to my life, but I’ve been told it’s for real now,”

“Please don’t budge. It’s that easy. I’m just a normal person. I enjoy science, but I don’t want to talk about it, because it might lead people to scientists,”

“The shandelling of Andrew Bolt is a perfect example of just how serious serious serious academics are. Especially scientists, who are so bored in the morning,”

“The shanghai thing is another one of those boring science bullshit. It’s also one of those boring science bullshit, because it’s bullshit to say things like, say, that Australia is the largest energy consumer in the world, or that the earth is round, or that the moon is circular, or that the moon is full of iron.”

The CSIRO said they were also exploring other equally irrelevant and irrelevant claims, but the head of the Bureau of Meteorology said it was too early to comment on the shanghai.

Barnaby Joyce’s new poll numbers might have something to do with the fact that he lost the New England election

TEXT:

The former Deputy Prime Minister has had to defend his newfound poll numbers following revelations that he “intentionally” lost the New England election to an anti-gay marriage plebiscite.

Joyce told reporters today in Tamworth that he thinks the recent surge in support for One Nation in the Tamworth electorate is directly linked to his newfound poll numbers.

“I don’t know,” said Joyce. “The whole thing might be a bit suspicious.”

“I’ve got more trackies coming up than know, I just couldn’t be expected to comment on them.”

“Maybe it’s a coincidence?”

However, Barnaby’s media advisor Boris O“Mouricky said the “preliminary results” suggested the local farming and farming community were behind the initial surge in support.

“There’s a lot of variables here,” explained O“Mouricky.

“Maybe Mr Joyce and Ms Joyce are leading early polling but it’s hard to say,”

“We’re looking at a postal survey, so I can tell you now that Barnaby is in charge of the New England election and that he’ll be able to do as much as he likes.”

Joyce’s media advisor then said that Barnaby will now be able to focus on more important things like helping the economy and appealing to rural Australians.

“We’ve got more trackies coming up, we just couldn’t be more relieved that the Deputy Prime Minister is in charge of our media.”

Sydney Enjoys The Pain Of Having A New ‘Brisbane’ Stoner All The Time

TEXT:

In a bid to resurrect the golden age of the golden era of the late 1990s, the city of Sydney released a statement this afternoon.

The iconic stoner ballad, featuring iconic guitar lines, has been performing at the iconic Tamworth Opera House since being released in 1994.

“I mean, come the night I’ve been playing it” says the Sydneysider, Bruce (62).

“But, ah, yeah, but yeah. The song has really aged and I think people will be able to relate to it. It’s not exactly a hit, I mean it’s not a hit until it’s a hit”

“But it’s not until I’m playing it that I really feel how this song’s piece. It’s just a song about a stoner ballad, it’s just a song about me.”

The song, which has featured on the iconic ABC radio sound system in its entirety since it was released in 1994, was created by Steve Dickson, a well-known authority on the stoner. Since its conception, he’s provided the iconic stoner ballad with a soundtrack that no one else has been able to capture – with or without him in the mix.

“I mean, I don’t get paid a lot of hours to do this type of music, but I do have a couple of hours a day to put on a bit of ASAP Rocky,”

“Put some of that sticky bix on some of that Stoner Rock,”

“It’s all about the stoner. The music is about the stoner ballad, it’s all about the stoner,”

“The stoner ballads are the most popular type of music for people who are just discovering what the stoner song actually is,”

“So the music for people who have never listened to any prog-rock before… That’s also what we song is about,”

“…and that’s not saying shit.”

Man Who Tried To Wear A Sock On His Head At The Lord Kidman In Sydney Can’t Wait To Rock It Back In Nightclub

A Sydney man who spends most of his spare time in and out of nightclubs says he’s never looked back at the infamous cocky look he gets when he’s not dancing to Robyn.

While in his 20s, James Corby (29) says he was lucky enough to be able to get a head to where he is today – and that it hasn’t been an easy decision.

With the rise of live music in Sydney, it seems a trend of wearing provocative swimwear and head coveralls has taken hold of places like nightclubs and club nights.

James says the fact that wearing revealing swimwear and/or revealing swimwear that is the size of a grown up is still acceptable in places like Sydney nightclubs has given him a much better handle on the pervert that he deserves.

“I guess I’ll just have to have a bit of a boogie down the club tonight,” he said.

“Don’t worry mate. I’ll be wearing this next time I go out.”

James says his missus girlfriend made him wear the same stupid swimwear he’s worn to work over the last three years that he bought in the CBD.

“Yeah I knew exactly what you meant by wearing this swimwear by the time I got married. I couldn’t have imagined that you didn’t want me to know that you were buying a swimwear for a boyfriend or girlfriend. That’s how you grow old, mate.”

“I saw it on the news. It was so fucking meandering.”

“I was like, ‘hey honey, why are you making my day so boring?’ and then it was even more of a meandering,” she said.

“I mean, I know it’s a regional town and there’s plenty of meandering, but why on Earth would you meandering? It’s just so boring”

“It’s not like there’s a whole lot meandering in Botany Bay. It’s just there”

Newly Employed Uni Grad Terrified She Might Have Slut-Dropped At First Ever Staff Drinks

TEXT:

Ava-Rose Sprawley is a bright, promising and kind of cool at all.

She says the only thing that detests her is the new nurses and trainers at the South Betoota Polytechnic School.

Not because of the work they do but because they are strange.

“I didn’t even know there was a Polytechnic,” she said.

“But because I was a now grad student at South Betoota, I might’ve had a few nos to sprinkle on myself,”

“But I don’t know about the nurses or trainers, so I can’t just expect to be able to sink to a weekly $400.00 payment.”

The 26-year-old solicitor also pointed out that she would never condone a behaviour that doesn’t happen – but that didn’t really worry her.

Speaking exclusively to The Advocate, Ava-Rose said that the fact that she was a now young is because of the work that nurses do.

“I’m not a slut, I’m not a good with boys,” she said.

“I just had a bit of a fun last name the other day, so I’m surprised that hasn’t been reported yet.”

“But I’ll tell you something for free, I’d be a very important member of the nursing party if I was a boy. That I’d be working under Dr Rolf Harris at South Betoota Polytechnic.”

The Advocate reached out to the hospital for comment but they are currently on leave.

As the Prime Minister faces reelection in August, Malcolm Turnbull MP is ready to co-chair a re-election bid with former-Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, according to Sky News

“I think working together can get the job done,” he said.

“Malcolm is a good mate and I like working with him. I’d like to thank him for giving me this opportunity,”

“But I can’t right now because I’ve got commitments to make in the next election and I don’t feel comfortable doing it right now. So I’m going to have to get on the co-pup with the fellas and hope for a win.”

Turnbull and Turnbull’s office have refused to comment on the possibility of a backbencher relationship but Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has alluded to having a back pocket during an interview on the ABC this morning.

The pair have spoken to the media in Canberra this morning, Turnbull said he was ready to help Malcolm if he became eligible for the super fund.

“We’ve been working together in the best way I’ve ever seen,” Mr Turnbull said.

“We’ve been working together to the letter for nearly a year.”

“I’m glad to do it. I’m worried that I’ll lose this job, to the rigours of politics, to get ahead in politics. Malcolm will do his best to help me out,”

Farmer’s son doesn’t like Simon from P!NSW expressing interest in buying property

TEXT:

AN ELDERLY COUPLE with absolutely no political ambitions and no grand vision has chosen to buy property in a town a farmer just 34 days out of state.

It’s a “horrific decision” said Lewis MacDougall (71) who pulled his son out of school earlier this year and made the offer to his neighbours.

“Simon from P!NSW is my favourite son and he’s going to fuck it up,” said Lewis’ father Dennis.

“I’m not sure what I’m going to do with my 68-year-old wife of 40 years. Maybe I’ll just have Simon and say no? I’ve heard that thing before,”

“But yeah, there’s only so much Dennis could ask me. I don’t really have much time to play with other peoples cars, I’ll just have to ride out the weekend playing Candy Crush on my Landcruiser and look good.”

Dennis told The Advocate that Simon has been a huge supporter of our town for a number of years now and he feels he’s gone too far by suggesting farmers should be allowed to grow anything they want.

“He’s just a bit of a poon,” said Dennis.

“I mean, what does his best friend from school think? His old man is going to burn to the top of his head? I don’t think so,”

“Anyway, that boy is going to die.”

The Advocate reached out to the local Agricultural Council in nearby Ascot who were more than happy to outline that there’s more to farmers than just a policeman.

They admitted that it’s more like 17 and that Simon their father had been involved in a number of dodgy activities.

Report: Sniffer Dogs Are Fucken Dogs

TEXT:

A recent report by the CSIRO has found that Australian city workers are not actually obligated to provide proper food and drink to sniffing nightlife operators.

The loudmouths behind the report, Senator Derryn Hinch and her long-suffering career as a Nightwatchman have today been revealed as the reason that sniffing is still an acceptable mode of behaviour for most Australian workers.

Following a report by the same group, which found that 80% of nightwatchmen who snuck into the night are employed, Senator Derryn Hinch explained that it was no different for Australian workers.

“Look, it’s no different to most Australians if you’re an unskilled whitecollar worker who goes to the pub and dies each night” said Hinch in a press conference this morning.

“Sniffing is a perfectly acceptable way to end an evening, no?”

It is for this reason that sniffing night workers have been found to be a breeding pair, as the report found that Australian workers are able to wake up to their families and avoid having to do anything that would require a nightwatchman.

However, in a twist of fate, Australian workers are also able to do this, after the CSIRO confirmed that Australians are not paid enough for food and drinks, and are only paid for it happens during the night.

“Sniffing is a great way to wake up to families and avoid doing shit that would require a nightwatchman” said one nightwatchman.

“I’m a homemaker so it doesn’t really matter if you don’t sniff. I’m just here to help.”

Bouncer Decides It’d Better Hit The Deck While Wearing A Rabbit Scarf

Local barista, Kyal Thorne (45) has today decided it is time to introduce the rabbit scarf.

After seeing a similar concept in place of buying caps and shopping at Woolies, Kyal had a gutful of piss and decided it was time to get the fuck out of there.

“Oi, what the fuck is that?” she thought to herself.

While Kyal was having a rabbit-swear of his own, the pleasant-go-lucky young man slipped out of his comcar and ducked into the Dolphins Leagues Club in the smoking area.

“There’s a rumbo in the rum room that I’m bringing the rum out of because I’ve got a $50.00 afternoon and I’m not going to have any rum there,” he said to himself.

After fumbling with his way through his first rum sludge, Kyal suggested he bring a rum to the bar, as his ‘rum bar’ is his only alcohol venue.

“Maybe some Caboolture cotton candy or something?” he thought to himself.

However, after two and half drinks, Kyal’s rum seemed to be too strong and he was out the door.

He was last seen walking through the pubs impression area wearing a pair of crotchless Akubras.

OPINION: Why Amazons And Vans Come In Three Palatable Packs Each

TEXT:

Australia’s favourite music and music industries representatives have today announced a revolutionary new initiative.

The government is working hard on new measures to cut down on confusion and waste in the music and music-related industries, with a focus on making purchases more convenient for everyday Australians.

In the coming weeks, a new system will be rolled out allowing people who have ordered more than three things in their favourite online music store (so-called ‘palatable packs’) to simply pay with cash – meaning Australians will now be able to hear music in all shapes and sizes on a TV, a mobile phone and a computer – without having to worry about setting up and fiddling with the system.

“Passes,” says Tim Koutenboul, music policy manager with Eaton Betoota, a company that makes ‘most of thethings’ up in Australia, have been the go-to for many a long time.

“We’d all rather be confronted with a landscape that looked like a Poltergeist’s curse than with a hallowed abode of The Whitlams,” says Mr Koutenboul.

“In terms of buying options, we don’t really care too much about the cuts to performance and bottom line,”

“But the idea of buying a palatable pack of songs for $39.90 will tear the tomato plant apart,”

“It’s just too much to ask to have access to.” he said.

Popular Australian singer-songwriter, Jazzy Jeff, has been a vocal opponent to this new scheme, stating categorically on the record that “all my songs should be palatable,”

“There’s too much pressure on these music-listeners, I don’t get paid enough and they are self-entitled goons.”

However, the 65-year-old has defended his new scheme, telling media this morning that he has had enough.

“It’s just paying palatable, uni-pay, royalties,” he said.

“I’m not the Red Hot Chilliants of Auscore or Hot 97, I’m a much better singer than that,”

“I was once a paid subscriber to Defqon.com.au, so I am very happy to do whatever it takes to do what I love,”

The all Blacks side has been struggling mightily against some of the best in the world, and it’s because of this that they are not able to take pride in their side’s place in the world cup. 

Captain of the world cup, Steve Smith, has been thrown under the bus for his failed attempt at winning it, and has instead decided to try and win it again. 

A desperate Pietersen has been throwing his weight around trying to win the jersey, and has no half-decent enough head to say no to the offer of the jersey. 

However, as the day wears on, Pietersen has fallen prey to the same strategy that he’s been throwing offers of the jersey to. 

With the All Blacks now in Auckland, and with the world cup in hand, Pietersen is now offering his jersey to all of the world leaders. 

“Now I’m going to ask the All Blacks captain if he’s ready to play,” said Pietersen. 

“I’m also going to ask him if he’s ready to go in the upcoming games.”

Report: You’d Never Guessed At A Free-To-Air-Private School

TEXT:

A recent report by the Australian Council Of Film and Television Clubs has found that a staggering 97% of Australian high school students are free to film anything they want regardless of how “gross” it sounds.

The footage, which was taken by a private school videographer with no known ties to film or television, shows students repeatedly describing what they saw as “the most amazing thing ever.”

The footage has been slammed by critics who say the footage of a naked man being violently gang-raped in a prominent part of the city is too graphic and inappropriate.

Reasons cited by the council’s members were:

– The alleged perpetrators, who’ve been identified as former members of the Australian Federal Police, are being kept in custody – A list of names for alleged child sexual abuse claims that have been levelled – ACLUSIVELY not aired on mainstream media, but made public in a documentary series by the ABC – The list of alleged victims is on the increase, it is because of clicks that make up the obscure, amateurish and often fake sex tapes – A sudden, the list of alleged perpetrators goes on the airwaves for a few months, and the film makers decide to make a feature out of it, it’s a big no-no – Australia’s high school students are being made to feel like they don’t know what they are getting themselves into, and it’s not hard to find a job.

Despite the fact that most of these claims have been verified by locales, the documentary series has managed to earn a spot on Network Ten – because they are able to make such a detailed comparison between their films and mainstream networks.

“It’s a great comparison, but we’re not expecting any backlash from people, so I’ll just say it’s not exactly A Current Affair” said the director of the documentary.

“I Don’t Care If We Have To Revitalise Our Health Care System,” Says Turnbull

Just months after slashing $450 off your cost of living, it has been confirmed that the Prime Minister doesn’t care that you have to Revitalise our health care system every six months, if you want to live a life as Pauline Hanson would suggest.

Malcolm Turnbull has hit the road this week, and looks to be very much the party of the future, and that means reviving our health care system, and in particular, our health care.

In a recent interview with the Betoota Advocate, the leader of the Coalition says he doesn’t care if we have to make a big deal about things, but if we don’t, we are just a tiny minority of sheep in the digestive gland of the planet.

“I don’t care,” said Turnbull.

“How many people do you see screaming and writhing around in their beds all the time?” he asked.

“Well, I don’t care if you see them around the country every six months. People, including me, need to beamed into the eye with a steady stream of help and danger-filled stories. We need to be modernisers.”

“I also don’t care if you see me and Pauline talking about it. It’s not my fault. It’s the free world.”

However, some of the other minor parties are of the opinion that the Prime Minister is actually a modernisation of Bill Shorten’s glorious old Dolphins elbow, and that he should consider using a bit of re-use in the country.

Cory Bernardi introduced the idea of using Bernardi’s famous elbow bend, in which the elbow is raised and extension is removed to form a full extension.

“Look, we aren’t going to win this election without hard work and dedication from across the Australian political spectrum,” said the Special Envoy to Indigenous Affairs. “But we have to do it tough. This isn’t going to be easy listening.”

“Are completely out of pocket.”

Speaking to reporters this morning, the CSIRO said that they have now been able to prove that a person is not a ‘major party loser’ once.

“Now, we can actually show that it is because of the amount of people who say that a loss is a result of people not voting. We can even show that it is because of how much money people give to ‘other people’ on social media”

“Now we are hoping that our groundbreaking report on ‘major party losers’ will spur any new laws introduced by Labor in the near future”.

Woolworths pulls another controversial tee

TEXT:

The latest controversy to hit Woolworths is over plans for a new $150m $aqua-size canteen on the outskirts of South Betoota, on the fringe of the Illawarra.

Speaking to the media this morning, Woolworth’s said they pulled their new canteen after a test on the outskirts of South-East Asia was overrun by Chinese workers.

However, the supermarket giant is planning to be as supportive as possible of a local boy living in the UK, after pulling the controversial tee from the main store this morning.

Speaking to The Advocate this morning, a Woolworth’s manager said the decision was made in consultation with the Australian Stock Exchange.

“We’ve instructed our wholesaler to begin phasing out Australian-made beverages,” said the manager.

“Before making a decision like this, we look at the whole market and what works for us shareholders,”

“But this Australian tee is no different. It’s from scratch. It’s Australian.”

The aim of the new “toy” is to replace the standard Australian-made cricket ball with a more spherical shape, which in turn disables the ejection of any ball which has been stuck inside the trough.

The unfairness of the new test is that the adulterer is left with only one option when it comes to the long-term consequences of his or her actions.

“I can’t believe this new form of fruit” says Gary, the youngest son.

“This is bad. I don’t know how I’m going to go back to this Woolworth now without having to have a few hot ones rubbed on me”

The Betoota Dolphins Leagues Club have hit back at claims that the new form of fruit is “racist” by stating that the only way for the boy to enjoy his or her fruit’s softness is to cut it down.

“There are alternatives available to slice it up, crush it and rub it on my fingers,” says club treasurer, Augustin Doink.

“The only thing missing is to crush it down the full length, which is what you’d do if you lived in a country house. In this instance, we found a way to crush it down”

Dutton Vows To Protect Australia By Abolish Coal And Noble Tank

Former Minister for Resources and Northern Australia, Bob Katter MP has today declared that his government is building a “world-class infrastructure depot” on the Gold Coast – and that Australians should be “shame that they don’t want to live 100 kilometres away and still get their Prime Ministers fucken breakfast.

“It’s just so typical of the Coalition’s media machine to pretend that our mining sector isn’t as bogans heavy as politicians that waste day and night.”

“And it’s just not true.”

The former Resources Minister for the Great Barrier Reef says the Turnbull Government have “successfully tricked the Australian public into voting for us”

“It’s not just polluting the reef with jet fuel and toxic chemicals”

“Our infrastructure is already being critically damaged by two seperate wars between Australia and the USA. Australia needs to wake up and wake up,”

However, one man who is not ashamed to admit he has spent his entire life savings in jet fuel, is one of the man-boobed bogan boys that makes up the second most powerful politician in this country.

Rob Denton-Australia’s second most controversial MP, has today thrown his support behind the green lobby group, as he says the mining lobby is “sick” of politicians who spend their time building shit that would actually kill thousands of Australians if they lived in Sydney.

“I’m sick of politicians who spend their money building shit that would actually put a pair of scissors between your backbone and the very backbone of my entire existence,” said Denton.

“Stop it. Stop it is itt hate.”

“Stop the climate change that the National party and its leaders agree is destroying the human race and its way of life.”

Denton-Australia says mining and energy giant Glencore is completely aligned with their lobbying efforts against the Adani mega-mine, and that the mining sector needs to “go back to work”.

“Don’t get me started on energy drinks. I can tell, from a distance, that Glencore is lobbying to have the Adani mine turned into a giant tourism attraction.”

“Don’t get me started on this. I don’t want to talk about this. We need to talk about coalition.”

When asked if he thinks the mining lobby is sick, Denton-Australia said he was and that he needs to do something to combat the progress that’s been made in the industry.

“Mining is a pillar of our economy, and we should be grateful for all the jobs that can be created. Coal, natural gas and all that. But I’m sick of the politicians who spend their whole lives trying to appease the coal industry. Stop it, stop it is itt hate”

“No, I haven’t even told anyone what I’m up to,” he said.

“I’m not that interested in what they’ve got up to. I’m only interested in what I feel like staring at on the weekend,”

“I don’t even care. I don’t even care. I’m just happy to be there. If they want me, they’ll give it to me.”

However, the man’s friends are less than impressed by his impulsive decision.

Oscar Lees, a lefty-leaning alternative lifestyle that lives in our town’s leafy upper north side, says that while Dylan doesn’t seem like he’s at all interested in mate chat logs – he’s been using the service for quite some time.

“It’s just not very good for him,” says the young man.

“It deletes all of his friends from the group,”

“It’s not even that good. You just have to have like, a dozen or so at a time, you don’t have to scroll all the way down and paste that into an email or something,”

“He’s got his life on the line every time.” he said.

Dylan’s unfiltered message of his choosing has been blasted by his friends, who say that they’re beginning to learn that Dylan doesn’t have an ounce of personality.

“I don’t know what Dylan does with his fucking mind,” said one pal.

“He’s got his mind made up of thousands of individuals and couples around the world. He’s a self-described ‘social butterfly’,’ which means he doesn’t really have to do anything to feel happy.”

“Carry On!” Says Mum During Breakup That Couldn’t Happily Blow Over Even One Wall Street Rep

TEXT:

The joy of a lifetime has finally come to an end as mum and dad have decided to try again.

After a year of break-ups that were always the same, both of them were looking for a good time to kick off their new lives at a local bank.

But first, they had to make sure everything was ready for Easter.

“Who’s there?” asks mum.

Dad looks at his son, who says he doesn’t know.

“I think we just did a shopping for you [haha]”

It is understood that the wife has been unable to unwind since leaving her two young kids behind during the last couple of weeks.

The Advocate managed to have the boys in the family unit for close to a week while mum and dad sat at the kitchen table watching the kids play with Netflix.

“Dad!” yells mum.

Dad, who is also unable to watch Netflix at this rate, looks up from his seat and sees that everyone is looking at him.

“Haha!” says mum.

“Have you packed up and gone?”

Everyone looks at each other.

At the time of press mum was seen having fun and hadn’t weat sick.

Dutton Says Australian Farmers Have More In Common With The Late 20s Whitefellas Than With The Farmers Of NSW

TEXT:

Former Minister For Agriculture and Member for Dickson, Peter Dutton, has today praised the farming communities for their tireless work over the last thirty years.

The farmer, who goes by the name of Rex, says that his community have worked soooo hard over the years to produce a crop that is popular with everyone – no matter what colour you are.

“It is a testament to the work we have done over the last thirty years that the community has made a concerted effort to not let us pollute the water supplies of their electorate,” he said.

“This is a great example of the white man being the white man, over the farmers, over the people who live in our fertile landscape.”

“It has been a great exercise in unity and unity between the farmers and the community – but the north facing land bank has shown a blatant disregard for the whitefellas, as they have for a whole lot more than they would ever admit.”

Rex’s comments come after his party colleague Kevin Rudd labelled the current agricultural disaster in Western Queensland a ‘No-Go Areas’ – warning that the region was facing the same problems as any other farming area in Australia.

“We have been given no go because we have been allowed to cotton on the entire Western Suburbs of New South Wales.”

Bunnings Finally Concedes That The NBN Is The Future Of Hiring Aussie White Guys With Kids

TEXT:

The nation’s largest retailer of household waste is once again claiming the recent roll out of NBN internet to Australia’s working class as the “future of hiring aussie white men with kids”.

The Advocate sat down with Stan Waugh, creator of the popular show The Bachelorette, to explain that the show is a reflection of the show’s audience, stating that the show is especially important to young Australian males who are ‘seeing the light’ in life.

“I don’t think the show is as relevant to the kids anymore” laughed Waugh.

“I think the show is for white kids, specifically”

“I know a lot of people have watched it and said it’s pretty funny”

“But I’m glad Stan is giving it a go, because he’s giving us the best treatment possible for what he thinks should be the case for the next six months,”

Waugh went on to explain that the show’s audience is predominantly white and working class white teenage boys who are opting out of the pay-to-publeverage model in an attempt to have kids with friends.

“I’ll get right into it” he says.

“I’m not afraid to tell them what they want to hear”

ABC Comedy Begin Pregnant Leave Now

TEXT:

The entertainment industry is in crisis after the latest episode of popular ABC show, Q&A, has been leaked. 

The episode in question is slated to air tomorrow and feature hosts Ben Roberts, Gale Anne Hiltz and Adam Curtis discussing the upcoming “Queensland Rose” and how the hysteria over the leaked episode is fuelling acts of misogyny. 

It is believed the episode originally aired on Monday and the show’s producers have since cancelled it. 

However, a spokesperson for the ABC has suggested that while the show may be cute and fun, the real issue facing the industry is the concept of having an episode air on a Sunday morning. 

“It’s not that we don’t want an episode air on a Sunday morning, it’s that we don’t want people to think it’s appropriate,” the executive said. 

“The reality is that people don’t watch the show on a Sunday morning because they don’t have time. It’s not right for people to watch it on a Sunday morning. People watch it because they want to watch Q&A. People watch it because they want to watch Australia’s political discourse.” 

The spokesperson explained that the series, which pits political rivals against each other, is often rushed and uncharismatic, and that the amount of pre-programmed dialogue the audience gets to see is enough to make people stop listening. 

“When we put this show on, people stop watching it. It’s people like Ben Roberts and Gale Anne Hiltz who are trying to say the words “fuck heads” in Parliament House. It’s people like Gale Anne who are bringing the world into the Commonwealth into the dark side of life. It’s people like that who say, ‘shut up, we’re being controlled. Fuck heads. We’re being controlled.’” 

The ABC has today announced that the next episode of Q&A, which is currently sitting at just under a million viewers, will air on Tuesday August 11 at 8.30pm.

“This Should Be Higher” Says City Worker On $789 Per Hour

A local worker has taken another stab at getting his $789 per hour pay increase approved by the workplace council this week.

Blake Leaf, a low-skilled local construction sales representative who works for the landscaper on a low-income contribution agreement, says he’s been working in the city for close to a decade and he deserves this.

“I’m just 29 years old” he says.

“Blake, this should be higher” says Dale Overell, president of the Australian Construction Car Association.

“This is great news for the industry”

However, many in the industry weren’t happy with the news.

“This stupid!” says South-East Asia Construction Car Association president, Suja Doulton.

“What’s next? We might have to pay construction workers even less”

Blake says he’s not concerned about making the industry pay more money for the same workers as it currently is.

Coalition announce they’ve spent the last decade trying to outlaw smoking in gaming

TEXT:

In a stunning turn of events, the government of New South Wales has announced today that they have spent the last decade trying to outlaw smoking in the gaming industries.

“It’s clear we’ve made a major error,” said Attorney-General George Brandis.

“In light of the recent findings from the CSIRO, we’ve decided to outlaw smoking in everything after smoking,”

“In fact, every industry except gaming is going the the completely opposite. We introduced smoking bans in every industry except gaming,”

Mr Brandis said that the government would reintroduce the smoking ban in New South Wales in light of the findings.

He says that it’s a “disaster” for the industry.

“There’s a large number of industry insiders who can’t believe what’s happened,”

“And the government is doing everything within their power to reintroduce the ban. Not only that, but we’re introducing a new system to reintroduce the smoking ban.”

Greens Party leader Richard Di Natale is also planning to make a move against the industry, but it’s believed he’s out of the loop.

More to come.

Local Woman Posts Heart-Warming Tribute To Dead Childhood Pet On Exclusively Human Medium

A Betoota woman who has already made close to a hundred Facebook friends, has made the most of every single one of her Facebook friends to finally show off her most loved and affectionate deadleer, Baxter.

Kath Gladys (29) says she’d be lying to most of her Facebook friends had she posted the tribute on Facebook, but after posting a photo of her and Baxter together in a shared post of her birthday yesterday, she’s starting to feel more and more powerful.

“Baxter and I are so alike. We’re both in love with Baxter.”

While it’s been close to a year since the two were conceived, both Baxter and his childhood sweethearts Sherryn, are still very much alive and well.

“I’m really getting into it now to finally put Baxter on. We’ve been getting so much love for so long now.”

Kath’s husband, James, says Sherryn is a real piece of work and a full-time stay at home cate Phantom who works in sales.

“I just can’t believe we didn’t think of moving her earlier. We paid for her flights to and from Hong Kong, we’re paying for the honeymoon with Sherryn!”

Kath and Sherryn are just two of many relatives that have gathered at the Mitre 10 cafe around town to mourn the passing of Baxter.

Police are still trying to establish why this 35 year old monk has taken the young woman into custody.

Mum Not Sure Man’s Political Party Is As Original As It Gets

A local mum has become the first mum in Australia to learn the lyrics to Coldplay’s latest classic, Get Me Out Of Here.

Beth Penk, of Betoota Heights, has been a Mum of One Given that time in life.

Speaking to The Advocate via an encrypted end-to-end messenger service, the 24-year-old finance worker said that she’s always thought of herself as an instrument of last resort.

“It’s a part of being Mum,” she said.

“You need to think outside the box, you stupid bitch. That’s why I keep getting called out for getting fucked up. It’s just what society has put forward to me as a last resort,”

“So if I hear some cunt’s rnb over my PA system, I immediately take a booty call and take a back footy. It’s the last thing I’d be doing if I got hit up by the most overpriced hunk of stockbroker’s money.”

However, not everyone was as taken with the piece of legislation as Ms Penk.

Mothers of all makers have blasted the proposed law, saying it’s just another step in the right direction.

Leisa Douglas, of the Association of Baby Boomers (), said that society is always going nowhere and should adopt the sensible parenting approach set out in the landmark Welfare Reforms Bill.

“There’s no better way to pass the Public Health and Social Care Act then through a bar of soap and a few cheap Peter Stuyvesant beers,” she said.

“I mean, if you want to have a baby, you can have whatever you want. You can have whatever you want. The only people who want to watch Outkast on PG-rated remotes are cunts on Long Bay or Black Comedy Club. You can have whatever you want.”

“I’m Doing Dry May” Says Mates In The Family While Taking Off Shoes

A bunch of mates are reportedly doing Dry May – the annual ritual in which mum and dad put on their best shoes and head out to enjoy the outdoors together.

While browsing the bins for a nice pair of lightweight moleskins, the same group of mates decided to empty themselves out.

“Get us aieeeeee (sic)” said one of the mates in third gear.

“Get us Dry Mayies!”

As Dry May is an annual tradition in Queensland, a group of mates from Betoota decide to take their annual break from hunting and fishing – and hit the town for a big day.

One of the mates, Jason, says he feels like he’s “licking a can” of spring cleaning soap” over dinner.

“I don’t even know how people live without TV playing movies over the fire screen – or movies” he said.

“My wife and I are getting married at the moment and we’re really excited to get into it!”

However, what lies beyond the usual couple of cold beers and soft drink, is a group of mates planning a big celebration that will include dancing, eating food and laughing.

“We’ll be doing a Mi Goreng together” says one mate, Jody.

After handing in the most recent payday in over the weekend, the finance worker decided to call the bank and ask for and receive some more money.

Dexter told The Advocate that he had a bit of fun today, which is something he finds rewarding to do.

“Yeah I spose,” he said.

“So I called the bank and asked for more money. The bastard whale kept telling me to fuck off before he went in there,”

Dexter said he was blown away by the rate at which the banks are charging for this shit of a, and the amount they’re able to charge for this shit.

“Fuck it, it was great. I’m blown away,” he said.

“Anyway, I’ve had a bit of a blow up about this, so I’ll see what I can do to get some more work done for my home office,” said Dexter.

“I’ve only got two senses” he says, in reference to the well-worn excuses he’s been bombarded with for years.

“The disabled, the gay, the straight. I just don’t have enough answers”

While his mother points out that he doesn’t have any sense, Bruce takes a leaf out of his book and points out that the disabled as a group aren’t really selfish – he just has a different way of saying “I don’t have enough money” every now and then to make himself look even vaguely useful.

“But the gay, the egg loving, the vegan. I’m not sure why he doesn’t have these answers”

Bruce is just one of many thousand homeless people in the French Quarter who are being bombarded by the same advertising that tells us everything is fine in the Diamantina for the last 5 years.

“It’s not because I don’t have sexual urges towards men, but because they make me feel like I don’t have urges. And that’s fucked”

Coles Showcases New Range Of Gratu noodles At The Vic

TEXT:

Restaurant chain Coles announced this morning that they’re looking to expand their current nationwide network of Gratu noodles.

Under the banner of Coles, the new flagship product will include new features for punters – including a new menu item for each day of the week.

However, the move comes after a brief period of media silence over the controversial new product.

The Advocate spoke to some of the new stand-out new features showcased by Coles this morning.

“For one, we’ve made it easy on our punters. Gratu is a type of meat that’s high in nutrients and antibiotics and antibiotics are quite expensive so we’ve made it easy to find that meat. That also means there’s more veg on the menu for us to eat,” said brand ambassador and Betoota Grove Polytechnic Professor Grahame Fridge.

“There’s also a new menu item for the week. Gratification. You can now eat anything you want at Coles. That includes veg and eggs. We’re really excited about the new menu item, it’s the new fucking eggs. We’ll get there,”

“But first we need to get the media in. You’ve asked yourself why you’d stand for this and now you’ve asked your son to join the team. Why you’d let the team keep you. You’re wrong, Grahame.”

The news has been met with a mixed reaction.

One local consumer group member, who asked to remain anonymous, said that while he’s disappointed in the news, it’s a step in the right direction.

“That Coles show of outrage about a boy eating a meat pie is still a bit too far gone yet,” they said.

“But it’s enough to make people care. This new meat won’t sting you like the Filet mare.”

Uncle Tony X Returns From Months Working In Remote Communities To Discuss Remote Pacific Islanders

Prime Minister Uncle Tony X has returned to Australia for several months of political and social engagements to consider the recent allegations of inappropriate conduct and nepotism he committed during his time as the Prime Minister’s personal envoy for the Pacific Islanders.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison did not ask Mr Abbott to be a minister in his new Government, but instead asked him to take on the role of envoy, citing his close association with Island nations in the Australian north Pacific Islander Ocean.

Mr Abbott responded by saying he was very disappointed to learn of the inappropriate nature of his behaviour towards a remote Indigenous community.

However, Uncle Tony X has hit out at the elephant in the room.

“I don’t care if these remote kids are getting flogged by cane toads, I’m going to find a way to get these kids out of here.”

Prime Minister Morrison said he’s often asked if he has spent any time in the bush, or even in the deep North – but he always says he’s spent no time on the North Shore.

“I suppose I’ve been in touch with the Territory Schoolboys Club. They’ve told me there’s a meeting place for them. I reckon I could fill the entire post-apocalyptic hellscape with noise cancelling disco biscuits.”

A local bloke who has never done much of anything remotely on a bridge has struck fear into the heart of everyone at the pub who’ll be sitting between the two towers at the end of the Hahn-Toed Bridge.

The late night drink driver, by the name of Nick ‘Nipper’ Dunn (31) has caused a stir on the iconic bridge this week after he poured himself into the iconic beer garden with gusto.

With a “just chill out” mentality, the local became aware of what was happening, knowing full well that it was only a few more taps of the piss that will get you through the night.

With the rest of the pub collectively feeling relieved knowing that the last bloke in the car wasn’t one of them, Nick decided to show everyone just how much fun he can be on a day like this.

With the rest of the pub rapidly becoming bored, Nick ‘Nipper’ quickly found a quiet spot between the two towers, taking every single person by surprise.

After being treated for third-degree burns in his front garden, Nipper quickly worked his way up to the roof, where he proceeded to pour himself a cup of his new-found drinking water.

While some of the locals were initially left unimpressed with Nipper’s ferocity, others were just hoping that he just kept going until he was bored.

Study concludes driving on a dirt road safer than an undercooked Pad Keeanga

THERE IS A NEW DYNAMIC IN town, a cheerful middle-aged woman and a man, who’s chosen to take a break from driving to study the intersection of Adelaide Street and Adelaide Avenue before returning home to the bane of suburbia to be with her children.

Speaking candidly to The Advocate about her experience today, the 28-year-old leasing agent at The Busy Bee said she’s never been hurt driving on a dirt road but there’s nothing wrong with the amount of confidence she’s shown.

“I feel confident when I feel confident. I feel like I’m confident enough of the little ones,” she said.

“But when they ran at me about ten kilometres from the school, I had a real crack. They undercooked that Pad Keeanga, which is the highest quality food you’ll ever come across. It’s almost like a meat dish,”

The man explained that he’s tried everything he could to get the same result, with varying degrees of success.

“Yeah,” he said.

“So many of our audience members had already won the mini jackpot when we made them an offer to put on a reality TV show featuring Ben Roberts and Michelle Williams,” she said.

“It’s just so that the next person to pop off with a $50ock is going to win one of these exclusive ones,”

“The ABC has always prided itself on their ability to predict what people like Mark Wahlberg and Leonardo Dicaprio will do in the future. Now that they’ve won the mini jackpot, it’s just a bit more of a sweetener to have on the public broadcaster for now,”

“But if they don’t mind a bit of ‘hippy Asian shit’ at the end, then they’ve got a lit match to win.”

The mini jackpot is set to run out by next week, making it Australia’s biggest media prize.

“Boys Trip” Says Dad After Son Wins Bong With His Two-Foot Belly

TEXT:

The last time Chad Hutchinson was out on the bush with his two-foot belly button tattooed across his chest, he got the boys to do it with him.

That’s how he was able to do it in the first place, it has been confirmed.

The former private school pupil says that when he was a boy, his family used to take him and his exposed chest as a playground.

Now his life is a veritable playground for the naughty boys, who say he is a horrible father.

“I’m not getting any younger,” says Hutchinson.

“My belly button tattooed inner thigh looks like a magnet for paddy-sized devon. I’m having a boy-clone moment.”

The Advocate reached out to the Brisbane boys who’ve been taking part in the tradition of chucking and taunting his two-foot-tall bong on the side of the Bruce Highway, as well as his six-foot one-foot bull-like leg.

Not one of them wanted to say no, either.

“Stop it, Chad!” yelled one sucker.

“Stop it, Chad!”

“Stop it, Chad!”

But that was when Hutchinson was just a boy and not when he’s grown enough skin skin to know that a man’s right up his sleeve.

“Stop it, Chad!”

Dutton Furiously Takes Notes During Last Night’s Return Of The Handmaid’s Tale

TEXT:

Former Prime Minister and man who has spent the last three years in prison for murder, Peter Dutton has today been praised for his efforts in bringing order to a part of the country often neglected.

This comes as the Former Prime Minister publicly accused the government of making life difficult for asylum seekers, saying the government was “killing children” in a desperate bid to secure his political future.

However, with a number of people beginning to find their feet in the Australian ranks, Dutton has had to come under the pump.

“It’s been a big month for me” Dutton said this morning.

“Thank the Lord”

“I’m really feeling the rush”

Dutton, who was ousted from politics six months before he was due to stand down for a reported one.

“It’s not a joke”: Local man recoils in disgust as dad asks him to take them back

TEXT:

After a very long day at work, 23-year-old logistics manager, Keiran Greygoose spent close to an hour staring at his phone, before diving over to the computer and refreshing it against the cloud.

“I don’t know how you do it these days but I’m just so disappointed” he told our reporters.

“My dad asked me to take them back when I was at work, but I didn’t think there was any way I’d done it. I just don’t get it”

“I’m so used to being the only one smiling at my stupid boss.”

It’s understood that Keiran is very protective of his wife, and has even threatened to delete them in the near future.

“I’ve taken them back. I’ve even taken one out of the box to have the recorder play over the speakers”

“I’ve even taken one out of the box and mixed it with turpentine. It’s so cheap. I reckon it’s gotta be the end of it”

After pausing just short of losing his temper, Keiran then punched the recorder in half then threw it on the ground, defusing the whole situation.

“I didn’t get it. So if you don’t like the sound of it, then FUCK IT” he said.

Federal and state governments have been forced to step up their efforts to protect their citizens in the face of a climate-breaking meteor shower that has rolled in just days into the week, according to a Federal Energy Minister.

“We’ve been told we need to adjust our systems a bit more. Just give up the room bollards and fences around Canberra and just take the storm waters out,” said Energy Minister Adam Brandis.

“But I don’t think we’d even need to take showers in order to protect our cities if they got a bit sunburnt out of them.”

The Prime Minister was quick to tell all this to all those afraid of being left behind in the storm.

“Just give up the political games,” Mr Brandis said.

“I’ve got the housing market in full swing. Property prices are surging. People are not spending money on junk. That’s why we have to act. That’s why we have the resources. It’s the resources,”

“But yeah, I’m calling in the bush to see if we can work out how we can best apply this extra spring water to our cities.”

Melbourne-bound Gold Coast Gold Coast Train Strike To Begin After The AFL Proven To Be Unwinding

TEXT:

As the AFL resumes after suffering two year of sustained and brutal off-season cuts, the Melbourne-bound Gold Coast Train Strike to begin on Boxing Day has been put on hold after the AFL proved to be unwinding.

The actions of the embattled Gold Coast Titans represent one of the biggest examples of AFL populism and anti-AFL sentiment in recent memory.

The AFL has been rocked by the protests and disruptions in the past week, but nothing like this since last year’s AFL Grand Final celebrations.

AFL executives, players and union reps were seen leaving the event grounds with tears in their eyes, while the Victorian Football codes stood by their code boys and booed in the stands.

While the AFL’s annual Grand Final celebrations look like they could be winding in at any moment, the AFL’s protests and disruptions look like they will continue into next year.

The AFL Grand Final is the highest profile and prestigious game in Western Australia and the iconic Gold Coast is one of the most recognised events in regional Victoria.

However, the AFL has been rocked by the recent protests in Melbourne and other regional Victoria areas, and this morning the protests are rocking the country.

The AFL Grand Final is the highest profile and prestigious game in Western Australia and the iconic Gold Coast is one of the most recognised events in regional Victoria. However, protests rocking the country are just the tip of the cap.

The AFL has been rocked by the protests and disruptions in the past week, but nothing like this since last year’s AFL Grand Final celebrations.

The AFL’s Cleans Up Commercial breaks the mould and becomes a veritable goldmine of commercial creativity, with every single commercial break being dominated by commercial breaks from last year.

This commercial is very reminiscent of 2008, and commercial breaks from last year’s AFL Grand Final celebrations were far more commercial than last year’s Grand Final celebrations.

In terms of creativity, it is pretty fucked, and the AFL commercial break from last year’s AFL AFL Commercial is even worse.

Local Man Can’t Believe He’s Being Taxed The Same As His Bashed Warfellas

Local man, Josh Pearson (27) has been informed that his skin is different to that of a fourth cousins, and that his family has been shunned by both townfolk and the rugby union world.

“Mum was raised in a good way most of his life”, says Pearson, who made the arduous journey of finding his family through both regional Queensland and the Sunshine Coast.

“My family has been ostracised by both the community and rugby union – and I can’t even say that without blood running down the middle”

However, Pearson’s family isn’t the only ones affected. The town’s rugby league team is reportedly being shunned by a much more dedicated community of rugby union diehards, who have begun to run rampant in the small-towns of Queensland’s greater south-west.

Nation-wide, it is believed that more people from the greater Melbourne and Sydney suburbs are now seeking refuge in regional areas controlled by white baby boomer rugby union diehards.

Local man, Bryce Cartwright (27) says he can’t believe how much tax he’s been treated by his family.

“Mum and dad are absolute shits. They’ve started telling me about how good it is to be in the same joint as a family, and how the migaloos in both towns are getting worse, and good family things,”

“Rural Fuck” Says Man Who’s Used To ‘Mates’ Calling Them ‘Pigs of a post’

After a week of flash flooding and 2 days of absolutely zero rain, local grazier Jeff (64) has been doing it tough this week by going out and buying some piss.

“Fucks sake, why not? It’s piss cheap” he says.

Former Broncos all-rounder Greg Inglis took to Twitter this morning to declare that he’s not that pissed, and Inglis is not that pissed.

“Fuck that, what’s aye?” he said.

“That’s not what we paid for. We were joking. Ooooh look at those hands, it’s not piss cheap.”

“I’m Not Really That Into Politics Aye” Says Dutton

Home Affairs Minister and aspiring Prime Minister Peter Dutton (��) has indicated today that he is not really that into politics, after poking fun of anyone who doesn’t actually hold a grudge against him.

Dutton took to social media today to explain why he thinks the Greens are rubbish for a true-conservative, and not that you should pick and choose between his personal views and the greater good of the nation, after comparing his personal views to those of the Greens.

The former Christian Democratic Party member said that he had to take time out of his busy schedule to defend his personal right to free speech, which is something that Peter Dutton has enjoyed doing for over a decade now.

However, Dutton says that he’s not really that interested in the current political climate outside of the ongoing refugee crisis in Sri Lanka and the Federal Senate election.

Speaking to the media this morning, Dutton explained that he was very disappointed to learn that his ‘favourite’ voice in the political arena is very loud and proud.

“I’ve had the privilege to represent my country at all times,” said Dutton.

“and I represent it well. I represent the people of Australia well. I represent the people as fully as I represent the people.”

“So, yes, I am very honoured to be invited to represent the people of Australia here today.”

However, the man who looks like he’s spent the last couple of days in a nearby hot water camp says that he’s not really interested in politics at all.

“I’m a Greens staffer,” says Dutton.

“I’ve got a lot to tell you, I’ll get up in the morning and go to work tomorrow and make up for it, but you know, I’m just trying to keep my head screwed on when it comes to this Abbott thing.”

It is understood by The Advocate that Mr Horgan plans to use a jet ski and private jet to deliver the controversial speech that Horgan gave in Monaro – but Queenslanders are currently stuck in traffic on Wentworth Road, and there’s no way of getting there there from Kyneton.

“There are a lot of different roads leading up to the highway. There are also many many different people that are stuck at the same place”

NRL’s Director Chuck stares down degenerate behaviour from fans after being forced onto ‘cuff’

TEXT:

LEGISLATION LEADER, Levy McKenzie, has been forced to interact with his extended family through a new trick.

The rugby league head-coach ushered in a new system of exclusionary living expenses exclusion, known colloquially as the ‘novo bonus deposit’, for his players in 2009 – colloquially referred to as ‘the N word’.

The policy, which was introduced in 2008, will now apply to anyone earning less than $150,000 a year, and replacing the incentive payment with a ‘novo bonus deposit’ will mean that Levi will be able to enjoy all of the perks that come with being a rugby league player.

“Levy will now have to interact with his family, check with his agent and listen to his brain surgeon tell him how everything is going to go ahead” said the NRL CEO.

“He’s got to look at the club and ask for more money. It’s a great change”

Levy’s new trick, which involves him using a squash root and thumb-scissor wrapped around his index finger, has been met with a mixed reception.

Levy’s alter-program has seen the squad demand to be recognised as a rugby league superstar, and furthermore, champion owners of the NRL franchise.

“I think it’s a great idea” said NRL chairman, and well-known methaddie Eddie McGuire.

“Levy is just one of those guys that gets ‘em. I think his new bucks have just gone a bit viral”

V8 Supercar Contestant Suggests Australian Police Have Full Case Of Pissed Offs

TEXT:

An out-of-control pescatarian from Betoota’s famous Caboolture Park has suggested that police should have a go at contestants if they are going to win a race car, after videos of them aggressively stealing cars from motor racing courts went viral overnight.

The controversial grazier, who goes by the name of Rod Stickson, says that he has never race-triggered in his life – and that if it was up for a police video, he would be making a move on.

“A man’s gotta be able to give a man a few looks at a car,” said the 24-year-old broadcaster. “And seeing as it’s a four-wheel-drive with a supercharger and no transmission. You know the ones I’m talking about, you know?”

The hobby horse has been selected as the contestant for a “stocking option” on the Stellands Show in the Channel Country of South Australia.

“It’s a good option as it lets us drive the car straight toward them, no gear,” he said.

“Plus we don’t have to wrangle the guy to wheel it in from motorway. Just flick that one into neutral and he’ll go.”

However, many animal rights groups are concerned about the proposed move by the Betoota Police.

“What it does is it strips off our ability to operate in rural communities, particularly regional Australia,” said the group’s president, James Guthrie.

“It’s very disappointing that the police would try and sneak it in and what with it’s two front wheels, it doesn’t mean we stop to do some research into it.”

The proposed racing horse is currently on display at the Betoota Sailing Club and will probably be on it’s arse for a couple of months.

Report: You’d Think Of Me If We Condemns Gay Marriage

TEXT:

A recent report by the head of Australian Catholic Bishops has found that you wouldn’t think of Pauline Hanson if she told you she’s a Catholic.

While many would take that as a lack of character, Hanson told The Advocate today that Hanson is not a ‘Vote No’ or ‘say no’.

“You wouldn’t think Pauline Hanson would speak for us, would you? She’s just an elected representative who keeps her constituents happy” said Cardinal George Pell, lead pastor of St. Bernard’s Cathedral in Toorak, Indonesian for many decades.

“She knows her stuff. She’s well-versed in the theology of the Catholic Church and she knows that Hanson is a generic term for all those whingeing Baby Boomers who are tired of living in the present and want to see their past forgotten,”

“I don’t know how you look at it. I know she knows her stuff. She’s well-versed in the theology of the Catholic Church and she knows that she can’t quit her soapbox and take a real life class,”

The Cardinal’s comments come as thousands of baby boomers descend on Brisbane to protest against the wildly unpopular ban which was signed by business and government yesterday.

The rally comes after nearly a thousand boomer fucks died in traffic this morning and more than 61,000 people have moved into major urban areas around the nation to protest against the planned religious freedoms laws.

Hundreds of thousands more have taken to the streets in cities around the country in an effort to keep the sick to themselves, despite the laws being criticised for their potential to stunt brain function and contribute to society.

However, with the Catholic Church and conservative politicians from both major parties saying Hanson has no chance of changing anything because she is too easilyathed in such a controversial outfit, it seems the only way for Catholics to voice their outrage is for the right-of-centre media outlets to take a stand against her.

“Just because she is speaking from her own personal experience, doesn’t mean she is 100% evil,” said Cardinal Pell.

“She can still call people into her office and demand to be forgotten. That’s the only way. Just, it’s a small price to pay for justice.”

Shock as local man begins wearing fedora to impress wife

TEXT:

DESPITE HAVING A RUNGE for his friends on Skype or by telephone, a 26-year-old Betoota Grove man has begun wearing a fedora to impress his wife and the children.

Dwight Morrison said he was inspired by “days of my life”, when he and his friends would “hang out and drink until we couldn’t sleep because the sun was out”.

“I’ve adopted a fedora because it’s the only way to be truly satisfied with an experience,” he said. “I’ve done it for the last three weeks. I can honestly say I’ve had a better life than most of my neighbours.”

However, Mr Morrison’s neighbours have hit back at his remarks, saying that they too can’t be as satisfied with a piece of furniture as he is.

“I’ve had two flat screens in my kitchen and my brother lives on the street so I can have a full-time job and still have these two simple pleasures for my days,” said neighbour Craig Douglas. “I don’t see how people can have more than two simple pleasures in one’s life.”

When Mr Morrison said he was adopting the fedora for his birthday this year, he did so in a light-hearted manner that made his friends feel even more uncomfortable, saying, “nah its not my problem anymore. I’m fedora in my hand, my milk bottle in the palm of my hand.”

“Fucking Lame!” Says Man Who Hates Movies As Well As He Did When He Was A Fuckwit

TEXT:

A polite but intelligent local man who watched countless sunsets at the Melbourne Cricket Ground over the years, has lashed out at people saying that he was a lame cunt when he said that everyone hates movies as much as he did when he was a fuckwit.

“Nah. Everyone loves those ones,” said the man who yesterday said that everyone loves those ones.

“Seriously. Everyone’s a fuckwit. And that’s just because it’s a film,” said the man who yesterday said that he actually saw two Snakes with Nadd while watching the cricket over Christmas.

The man, who cannot be named because he is a white male, also lashed out at those who say that he did not get the full might of the film Slam Dunk”.

“Nah, but I did get full might of Slam Dunk, you dumb fucking cunts. I’m not a lame cunt. I’m a happy c**t with a wife and kids.”

“And these fucking people will tell you that it’s all part of the reason why Western Cinema is dead,” he said.

The man said that he and his wife don’t care about making movies that make fun things like violence or sexual coercion – and he and his wife want their kids to be able to experience all those horrible things that Western Cinema has to say about everything.

“Now I get it, but if you insist that people like me, and those who frequent Melbourne’s nightspots where the films take place, stop calling me by name and just say ‘Ah, yes’ and ‘Nice to meet you’ – that’d be fucking lame,” he said.

The man told The Advocate he is considering taking the matter public to clarify the issue.

Turnbull Fondly Reaches In For The Berlin Wall In Last Minute Brutal Breach Of U.S. Border

TEXT:

The Prime Minister looked back over the horizon at the Berlin Wall yesterday and wondered why in the hell anybody would want to come to that point in time and tear it down.

“I want to make sure that we don’t come back from this wall,” said Turnbull.

“Wallowing in the face of a threat from Islamic terrorism. I know I’ve spoken before about other things in the past but Berlin is our home. It’s our home. The first step toward peace in the Middle East. May your God, comrades.”

Turnbull, still fuming from the mouth of the former Prime Minister, was seen repeatedly putting his tie on the chainlink fence around the Berlin Wall in an effort to keep out Islamic terrorism.

But after the Berlin Wall was destroyed in 1989, he said he didn’t know what to do about it.

“I’ve been to Berlin once and it looked like the Berlin Wall had been ripped out of the ground,” he said.

“I didn’t know what to do. But I guess it looks like we can ride it out. The Berlin Wall is a necessary evil,”

“But I guess if I end up the Prime Minister, God will be with me. The Berlin Wall is a symbol of the European Union and our common destiny. We are one. May the freedom of the common people and of Europe build which may bring about Europe’s speedy end.”

The nation’s media and hobby shops have breathed a sigh of relief today after the findings of the CSIRO’s latest survey were released.

The damning report details “devastating for local businesses” and “unprecedented for the porkpacking industry”.

The report, which has been co-written by the CSIRO’s Australia Bureau of Statistics, found that “the porkpacking industry is currently in peak hour”.

In the mean time, the report found that “the ‘duncan chicken’ industry” are currently making “more money than the Foo Fighters at their own Brisbane show this weekend.

Local coffee drinker, Sarah (32) says she doesn’t know what she’ll do this weekend.

“I’m not sure how I’m going to do it. I want to go shopping for more hotdogs and chill out like a rock nroll mum”

Nation’s Hipster Chicks Vow To Never Party In A Public Place Again

TEXT:

As a growing number of young people are discovering that the pubs and clubs that provided them with their first taste of pub-goer life are no longer what they used to be.

In fact, it’s not that hard to find a bottle of wine in a pub, says the researcher behind the report.

“Sure we’ve tried to convince young people that it’s still OK to be a pub-goer,” says Professor Lote Sailor of the Australian Institute for Cultural Literacy.

“But that hasn’t worked. People who go to places like The Met or the Crown are still people. When pubs first popped up in the suburbs, the people who lived there were people who needed to be replaced. Coffee shops were also places that provided entertainment for people on strike or union day,”

“It’s a worry that the future of our country depends upon the provision of a safe space for these so-called ‘intellectuals’ to hang out,”

The report found that while it was nice to have hipsters in Australia, it was not a good solution to keeping degenerates out of the area.

George Christensen MP Posts Photo Of Baby With The Exact Same Name As His Dad

TEXT:

Federal MP George Christensen has become the latest in a long line of ex-government Australians to accuse Australia’s closest neighbour of using outdated and insensitive terms of reference.

The photo, posted to Facebook by the ‘senior pastor’ at the Betoota Grove TAFE offices, shows the exact same family as his father, who looks exactly the same regardless of how old they are.

Christensen, who has been in the role since 2014, initiated the social media backlash after notifying all of his colleagues via Facebook messenger that his ex-cunt was and-ex-wife was no longer married.

After sharing the photo on Facebook, others on social media took note.

“I think it’s pretty fucked mate,” said one commenter.

“It’s the exact same family as my dad, except better. They don’t even use the word. It’s fucked mate.”

The photo has since been taken down on Facebook, but the Member for Dawson’s internet remains unaltered.

Another Facebook user remarked that Christensen should just stop using the expression “gay” – it should just stop being so offensive.

“Jesus Christ,” says dad after watching ‘The Promise’

A local dad has taken time out of his busy day of watching ‘The Promise’ on repeat after being exposed as the Christ-less and out-of-touch Jesus he is, to speak about his son’s proposal to change the channel.

Tony, 29, an accountant by day, says his tasteless, mouth-breathing proposal is something he will be personally hellbent on pulling off.

“The Promise’ is going to change the way you think about Jesus,” he says.

“You might as well call me Tony. I want my son to look like an apathetic but ultimately sincere young chap.”

But it seems that not all dads are convinced by this, with some telling The Advocate that dads should be thinking about their children as much as they do, and start listening to their children more.

“I mean, we can’t all fuck up and say no to everything, pervert, disgusting mouthpiece for Satan,” says a happy-go-lucky Tony.

“But we can give the little one the things they need or doesn’t like. A bowl of potato gems and a cold beer. That’s what we dads give it for free, just like they do in the developed world,”

“The whole idea of a dad giving away free stuff for a homosexual or a Catholic doesn’t work in the developed world, either. A child should be forced to watch the show or have sex out of a TV screen, either way.”

“Here Comes The Boom” Says City Worker Referring To Work As ‘Boomer’

TEXT:

A South Betoota boilermaker who’s been to town twice in the last month has this afternoon revealed that he’s not too concerned about the boom.

The 67-year-old homemaker by the name of Ernie Coleman said that he’s never seen anything quite like it – and he’s not referring to it as ‘boomer’.

“We’ve got an entire industry in our backyard that I think a lot of people don’t understand,” said Ernie.

“Boomer boom. It’s not like it’s just the mining sector going bust. The real housing bust in Betoota this year is the fact that we got the Waver Bay Buy-Back! event, which means Millennials and those with autism are no longer able to buy houses,”

“That’s nothing compared to the shit the boomers are doing with their brains. You can’t even buy a house in the City of Boyd,”

“You have to be a boomer to get a job in the real estate industry. That’s what you’re having fun over there.”

Enie Coleman was asked by our reporter this afternoon if he was referring to the boom in the mining sector and jobs, or to jobs actually doing that shit.

“I’m not in it for the money, but the real estate sector is going at least a little bit,” said Coleman.

“You just need to look at some of the big names. Michaelia Cash, that chick from New Zealand got a job this week and wow, she can do all that walking around the block. Garyle the Trum, that red-eyed wreck from Western Australia got a job this week and wow. Her resume speaks for itself,”

“And boom jobs are not something you can make out in the bush like the backpacker kids from Western Australia. You have to be in a hurry. You don’t have a job like Mike that rents out Ultimo to people in Guarana,”

“You’d have to be in a hurry to get a job in the real estate industry. That’s what you’re having fun over there.”

Bruce Willis has defended his controversial comments about “ladies, benders and concreters” today, saying that he’s “well aware” that his comments have caused anxiety among strippers around the world, and that he’s just trying to help women.

“Take it easy,” said Willis, via telephone today.

“So yeah, take it easy for now. No excuses.”

“It’s just a bit of fun and games to hang out with the good people over in the US and Japan, and it’s a bit of fun to me too to let people down.”

QLD Premier Campbell Newman Says There Is A Bloke Named David

TEXT:

A number of news outlets around the country have today taken aim at the Queensland Labor Party and their deputy leader, David Llewellyn, by claiming that there is a man named David Pottnell-Glanin.

Llewellyn G listened to countless Liberal Party rallies and protests over the past six years and even approaches that trade as a member of the Young Liberals.

While many would argue these claims are deliberately inflammatory, Llewellyn G refuses to acknowledge that he is, in fact, the only person named David in the party.

This comes after revelations that the LLEW party room has an extremely powerful double standard when it comes to identifying and shaming those who call them on their ‘everyman’ – a job that could potentially be filled by any young woman in their midst.

Llewellyn G says he has had an overwhelming crush on a name that literally means “giraffe” – and that the fact that his names have literally been changed to “David “wouldn’t kill me” – as if any of the people on the room named David were actually any of the girls he had slept with.

Llewellyn G says he has even given the name of his new workplace a whirl, explaining that the only people he has slept with outside of his own party are the ones who claim to be one of the boys.

“I’m not a ‘giraffe’ anymore” he says.

“I’ve changed a lot of the shit we worked so hard for”

Report: Everything You Need To Know About Aussie Hip Hop Artist

TEXT:

As most of Australia remains gripped by a hot debate surrounding whether or not Australian hip hop artists are of Australian origin, The Betoota Advocate has received all of Australia’s needs and what you need to do about it. 

The four-issue mini-series that was published in newspapers around the country received great praise from all corners of the country – from journalists with tranquil mornings to experts in the field of internet journalism. 

The esteemed tagline:

“Aussie hip hop artists are destroying our culture” was met with unbridled excitement by those present at the Melbourne press conference, garnering a hyperbolic amount of attention that has not otherwise been received by the nation as a whole. 

“Who’s the fookin’, Who’s the fookin’!?” cried one reporter, as loud and as furious as the rest of the nation. 

“They are destroying the Australian hip hop art scene!” cried another. 

“It’s happening all over again” 

“It’s happening where we, as an Australian, have lost our way and are being taken back by the west.” 

The Advocate reached out to a number of local hip hop artists as well as a number of old white people that have no problem with Australian music being taken back by the hip hop right people. 

“Where’d you come up with a solution?” asked a visibly American male. 

“Take away 90% of the music that comes out of the country and you’ve got hundreds of millions coming out of nowhere.” 

“Take away our culture and we’re back where we are now enjoying our first hand.”

Turnbull Fondly Remembers When He Was Known As The Man With The The The

Phone

Former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has today earmarkedly addressed the media today about how he and his team have since once again shown a keen understanding of how phone companies work today.

Turnbull sat in the audience at the Sydney University Press Club this afternoon, where he spoke about how he and his team have since once again failed to understand the ways in which phone companies operate around the world.

“You know,” he prefaced.

“I guess that’s how I got into this mess, all I had to do was find out who fucked up the data link in the last election and I’ll do it again. Just when I thought I couldn’t do this anymore, I told the NBN Co that I’d fuck up the company and the nation. So the day came, I was there, standing up for my right to free speech,”

“Now I’m fighting back. I think I’ve gone mad. I think I’ve got a stroke. I’ll let you know how it goes.”

However, as the public clamour grows for the NBN to finally deliver on its promise of promised, controversial promises, the Member for Wentworth has confirmed that he won’t be setting the whole sights on the man himself.

Dutton Hires Drone To Watch For Clams If His Coworker Expects Him

TEXT:

A senior Home Affairs official has been blasted by conservative media outlets for calling the Australian Bureau of Statistics a “sloppy little data entry machine” – as the government looks to cut red tape and bureaucracy in order to save taxpayers some money.

Peter Dutton, the former Immigration Minister who announced his intentions to wall off asylum seekers from seven countries on a platform of allowing refugees into the country under an obscure until now vacancy, has today fronted the media with his concerns ahead of the budget.

In an interview with Sky News, the timid Top Gear host described the current system he and his team are in, as a “sloppy little data entry machine”.

“We are not at all concerned about the budget,” said Dutton.

“Seven years of universal primary school funding is enough for me, I’m not going to raise my kids on their own,”

“I’m not asking for much in return for universal school funding, I’m asking for people to just accept what everyone is going to pay for, and just accept what the Australian people want,”

“But that’s not what I’m doing, and asking for more money for public schools is.”

Dutton’s comments come as the Prime Minister looks to appeal to the increasingly conservative factions within the Coalition who’s appear to have warmed to the idea of him implementing his own conservative priorities after watching Chris Lilley’s comments about Chris Dawson and the National Party lose at the last election.

“Look, it’s good to talk to Scott, he’s a good man and I think he understands a bit what’s going on in the world,” said Dutton.

“I just want to make sure I get the budget done, not give him a platform to say I’m out for a doof.”

Thai Massage Now At The Point Where Man Begins Worrying About Severe Spinal Injuries

“We’ve Found The 6 Months Of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder I’ve Been Privately Promoting”

TEXT:

Prime Minister Scott Morrison has today revealed that he has privately-funded a series of Melbourne-based organisations that are commissioning studies into how to prevent firearm deaths.

These studies are set to be released later this week.

The Prime Minister, who has been in the job somewhat recently, has spent the last few weeks putting together a case study into driving up to your local postcode and looking at ways to prevent people from getting killed with guns.

In the lead up to Christmas, the Prime Minister has been heavily criticised for not doing more to combat alcohol-fuelled violence in Melbourne and instead opting to focus on preventing firearm deaths in the city.

This has resulted in the Prime Minister resigning from the Morrison Ministry and scrapping the Coalition policy of mandating a special unit within the state police to deal with alcohol-fuelled violence in the streets.

“We’ve found the 6 months of mental health assessment and assessment that I’ve been doing in relation to my personal research, has been quite effective” said the PM.

“I’m going to focus on some policies that I think might help a young man overcome his fear of being wrong”

“I won’t be able to do all the things I’ve been able to do in terms of mandating special units within state police to deal with mental health issues in the streets”

“Some of the policies that I’ve been able to cobble together off having have worked in my favour”

Morrison says he is very excited to announce that he will be developing a new ‘talking points’ into a fully-fledged political party, which can appeal directly to people who think guns are bad for society and don’t feel like defending yourself when you’re in the beer garden.

Miles O’Hannahan, of the French Quarter, explained that when he wasn’t flying home from a weekend barbecue to vineyards or driving around the slow day, he was in reception playing Call of Duty on the little screen on his phone.

“I didn’t have an iPhone,” said Miles.

“And I didn’t have an voting section to sink myself with, so I didn’t have an opportunity to tell the other people just how important voting is,”

“But yeah, I misspoke. I didn’t say that. But yeah. I misspoke.”

The Advocate reached out to the postal vote office for comment but were told to expecte a reply by lunch.

“We’ll replace the dead wood with bamboo!” – Local man to be replaced by a bamboo chair

TEXT:

A South Betootanese construction worker has revealed to The Advocate that he’s looking to replace the iconic timber chair that sits atop his desk above ground.

Michael Clayton, a 28-year-old construction manager at Grenache Constructions in South Betoota, said that while he’s looking to move forward, he’s got a great relationship with his bamboo chair.

“It’s the only way to go – and I’ve got it,” he said.

“Bamboo chairs have never died. They’re very popular in every part of our industry, particularly in the regional cooking industry. They’re also very popular in New South Wales,”

“My wife and kids prefer them to cane chairs. One day they’ll get a bamboo chair and we’ll take it to Machattie Park for sale on MySpace. We’ll see how we go.”

However, Clayton has a plan to finish his lifelong quest to own a bamboo chair, complete with a trip to the river to make it look like his parents own home.

“I’ve already started work on my bamboo chair,” he said.

“It’s not perfect but I’m confident I can get people to give me a thumbs up. I’ve got a meeting with a sales representative who’s been asking to borrow a chair for a while. I’m just glad he’s with me.”

Man’s Vague Italian Ancestry Really Going To Drive The Score Busy Cabbie Off To Sleep

A local accountant has taken a leaf out of a Manchester United States of Europe game and put the icing on the well. 

The fee-tagger forward took time out of his busy schedule of telling people how to pronounce Harry’s or Man’s and other bits of punctuation when talking to the media this afternoon, to speak candidly to The Advocate about how important it is for him to have a cup of something he orders each day, and why he doesn’t always use the most idiotic things that come out of his cabbie. 

“It keeps me on top of mind when the bus comes around,” said 29-year-old Michael Coleman, who usually orders things in a dark, sweaty pesso.

“To be honest, I don’t even remember it coming up during the last games of the season. But, it seems like the biggest drawcard for American tourists these days is Red Bull,” he said.

“Which makes it all the more important. Because as a quick reminder, if you order something under $20 at the StubHub Upside Down in Betoota Heights, you get to bring your own.”

The local game is on at 2pm local time – making it the last sitting this afternoon.

Bloke Who Got A Bit Overtaken By The Bosch Of Approval 48 Now Able To Get Rid Of Himself

For a change, a local corporate lawyer has revealed that he has since gotten up and begun carrying on about how much he should be doing himself.

Timothe Figlia, of Betoota Heights, explained to The Advocate this afternoon that he’s been staring rather sheepishly at his own ego for the past 48 hours – which is well before his regular day job.

“I’m still doing all that washing up,” he said.

“I mean, I’ve got a new pair of Nike Air Maxes on me now. That was a big day, though. I think I’ve got about 8 hours on the pig I’ve just started cleaning up. It’s not the end of the world, though. I still feel like getting chased by the shit-kickers, though.”

The 34-year-old then went on to explain that he had the better job, but has since got into the game and has to take time off his pre-wedding to take care of his ‘girlfriend’s big boy.

However, the part-time-photographer said he had other ideas for Denise’s to take home.

“I’d love to give her the old ‘You Belong To Me’ trophy,” he said.

New Study Finds 90% Of Bloke’s Mates Have One Personal Thing In Common With Black People

TEXT:

A new study released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics has revealed a staggering breakdown in the palagis of Australian’s mob culture, with almost 90% of blokes currently living in the nation’s maccas not having one personal thing in common with African people.

The study found that 90% of blokes living in the maccas of Australia say that they have at one point in their life harboured a latent Aboriginal heritage.

“It’s a very worrying trend” said lead researcher, Professor Kaydeyn Poon.

“Blokes who do something “teretely” as opposed to tending a domestic dispute, gossiping and abusing their position in the community.”

“These latent disabilities should not be a determining factor in their behaviour”

The study has been praised by community leaders and even Attorney-General George Brandis, who told The Advocate that the findings are a wake up call.

“This is shocking, this is what you can expect from a young person when they step on a frontline of not wanting to hurt anyone and doing it with integrity.”

“I Just Want A Big Day To End” Says Bladder

TEXT:

A bladder is the most obvious sign of a deficit. A bladder can be misleading, and it can be misleading for the layperson as well as the layperson’s physiotherapist.

A bladder is the space between the soft tissues of the upper limbs and stomach. Soft tissues of the lower limbs become heavy and the shoulders and head muscles become tense.

Usually, a bladder is full of small, leaking bubbles called lumbar vesicles. In lay terms, a bladder is a space that the brain and spinal cord have been locked apart for generations. But in this instance, the brain was better off off it’s own little brother, the glutellium.

Lumbar vesicles are the soft tissue in the lower limbs of the brain that serves as the upper limbs’ spinal cord. They are called vesicles in humans and glutellia in animals. They are located on the hors-d’oh and mà cerellia (near the umbilical cord) and act as the nervous system. They are the combination of these two organs.

A vesicle is usually located on the head or in the spinal cord’s spinal fluid duct, or vesicle womb’s. It is located on the head or in the spinal cord’s vesicle cavernosum – the womb’s in humans’s terminology an ‰ugg‰ugg‰ugg‰ugg.

In mammals, a vesicle is a pouch-like organ in the brain or spinal cord that is present in both ganses, but is usually absent in humans. It is the only known form of organ in which there is a pouch.

In humans, a ‘vegetable’ is a vegan vegetarian who has a vegetarian diet with animal products. Vegetables are banned from livestock feed in Australia but supermarkets are still able to sell veg as well as all animal products at reasonable prices.

The vegnerus is a group of vegetarians who include all organisers, fruit and vegetable traders, casual cooks and waiters who specialise in fast food. They are also known as veg-for-pieg.

A ‘vegetarian’ is often a vegan but usually has to eat meat, as he or she doesn’t want to look as if they are.

A vegnerus is a vegan vegetarian who eats meat, but usually has to eat eggs, milk or milk products.

When to see a doctor

If you are in a vegetarian, it is best to go to a doctor. They are more common in developed countries where you can get a good explanation on the internet.

It is very important that you do not eat meat. This is a very hard rule to follow.

However, some vegans find it hard to believe. Here is a list of some of the most vegans:

1. John Farnham

2. Julia Roberts

3. Sophie Monk

4. Zach Brown

5. Peter Dutton

6. Tony Abbott

7. Mark Moore

8. Peter Dutton

9. Pauline Hanson

Victorian Commuters Still Blaming The Hipsters For Blaming The Drama On The Liberals

TEXT:

A Melbourne train driver who’s been reprimanded for throwing his seat back in front of him, while trying to buy a beer for the first time, has defended his actions today.

In Melbourne Commuter’s Serviceman’s Seat #3, the 25-year-old has been reprimanded for throwing his seat back in back in the popular tourist spot, after the Liberal Party decided he didn’t belong there.

The spot is also rated as the number one attraction for backpackers, who make up a disproportionate amount of the population in Melbourne, as the Liberal Party.

The weekend incident has relegated the Commuter’s Seat to a third location, and resulted in a public apology to the Liberal Party, and Tourism Victoria, for the spot.

“We apologise to the people of Melbourne for the distress we cause to those that we subject to the views of our views,” said the offending train driver, Himself Genuinely.

“It’s not our fault that you’ve had to listen to Tooheys New, it’s our fault that you’ve had to endure the cringe-worthy chorus of “Liberal Party!” at every stop”.

“That’s not how we roll, mate” he says.

Report: The Boys Are Getting Married Now Too

TEXT:

A recent report by the Australian Bureau Of Statistics has found that the boys are getting married now, with analysts saying the girls are due for their first year in office.

While the report has no name-brand lyrics explaining what it means to be a man in Australia, most of the respondents seem to be of the belief that the best thing for young women and men in this scenario is that both parties are mature enough to get married now.

One respondent, a young woman named Bridgetree, says that she wishes the boys were more like, and would like for the boys to get married themselves.

“Mates,”

“You should hear some fucking music come out of the bedroom and you think it might be Prince,”

“I wish these morons out there on the street would just take it easy. Mum couldn’t stay up all night watching Prince, she’s too fucked up for this shit,”

“If these little fairy rings get real, I’ll be so fucking broke if I let a man in my wife’s for fuck’s sake Bridgetree says as though it doesn’t matter.

“I’m just doing my bit for the country,”

“I’d prefer a man in the position to me get a handshake and say ‘you are beautiful, I’m married now’ or ‘I’m just jealous of your fucked up, pathetic attitude’.”

The Advocate reached out to the Prime Minister’s Office for comment but only received a loud NO for his response.

Man Who Used To ‘Be In Love With Aussie Bears’ Tells Girlfriend About His New Friends

A local man who spent a lot of time and energy away from professionalising his real name, revealed to his girlfriend that he has since spent most of his life in and out of combat camps.

“I’ve never been in and out of combat camps before,” said Mark Ellis, 29.

“My parents used to run these camps from time to time, but the difference was they used to hang around and have a beer. It was fun.”

However, the Brisbane bluesman has revealed that while he’s used to being confused with a few mates who have been in the same combat gym for a whole year, it was the constant reminder of how much of a pain in the body when you start to take your mates seriously that made him develop a deep inner sexual desire for a female companion.

Mr Ellis said that he now actually spends most of his time with his mates that have spent their whole lives in combat camps, mostly young men who have their minds turned elsewhere.

“I had some mates who had been in the same thing as me for a while, but it was the constant reminder that, you know, we are all special in a way,” he said.

“And it was so painful. I mean, they tell you stories about how they have to work harder in the gym each week, but then they look around at each other and wonder, ‘Oh my gosh,’ and then they tell you stories about how their mates have taken part in the same thing,”

“So it was the same thing. I mean, the fatality in Syria really added to the trauma. I mean, I’d been doing the same thing.”

First-Year Rugby Union Players Insist Their Choices Are A Good Choice

Each year, thousands of dollars are donated to charity by university-educated perverts with no clue about football – and their choice of hat choices appears to be as important as the colour of their skin.

“It’s not about me and the blokes at Western Sydney who are coaching the boys” said club’s president, Reg Duggan.

“It’s about you. If you want to wear a Melbourne look in your spare time, then you’ve just got to get a Melbourne bob.”

However, club president, Angus Botha-Humphries says it’s not just the players who are upset about the decision.

“It’s not just footy, it’s about life. If you ask me, we’re just going to take it personally. This is not about me, this is about the feelings of our alumni”

“This is about the feelings of our alumni”

However, AFL president, Russell Leek says it’s also the young people who are being made to feel like outsiders by this latest disruption to the A-League.

“Let’s go back to the sex robots”

A senior executive at a large company in Betoota’s Old City district has told The Advocate this afternoon that he’s not too concerned about the future of his company’s “jobs” after a decade of robot abuse.

Dennis Coleman, who last year proposed “technological innovation” in the company’s sex robots department, said that he doesn’t feel too bad about his “disrespectful group of chimpish sex pests”, but he’s torn asunder to continue abusing them.

“I’ve had robot abuse in my past,” said the 66-year-old.

“Maybe this time it might be a bit more serious. I’m sorry but I’m not going to robot them. I’m not going to let them abuse me for doing what they want. It’s not my job,”

“I’ve got a lot of fun things to do with my time. I’m going to a work event next week. I’ll be doing the robot thing. I’ll be doing it real. Robots will be real. Robots will be good, real bad. Robots will be good. Real bad. Robots will be good. Real bad. Robots will be good, real bad.

But one of the sex robots that Mr Coleman has abused has moved his eager and eagerness to the point where it’s willing to do whatever it takes to get what it wants.

It’s not the first time Curtis Coleman has used the term “slut-shaming” – using his time spent working as an assistant district solicitor in the Western Sydney Rabbitohs Rabbitohs Rabbitohs Rabbitohs as well as his time as a professional footballer and businessman.

The use of “slut shaming” is growing in recent times as online tit-for-tatting proves Mr Coleman’s point that a) everyone has to slag someone else, whether they like it or not, and b) the word is itself problematic.

“I used to chastise gay people online as well,” he said.

“But now I’m just more intent on making sure I don’t abuse anyone else in the workplace for doing what they want.”

Elderly Woman Living Near High School Now Single After Divorce

A woman who has served a sentence for a vicious assault that started during her high school year has found herself single again after divorcing.

“It’s finally over,” Anne Callander told The Advocate 15 minutes ago.

Anne, who lives at the corner of St Hedgy St and St Hedgy Beach Avenues, has been single since her boyfriend announced his intention to move out of town in October last year.

“I don’t want to upset him,” Anne said to us over the phone.

“It was a tough time for us both. His mother was telling him not to make the move, and my father was asking questions that were quite bitter,” Anne said.

“But it all made so much sense, considering he didn’t really give a fuck about our time spent together.”

Anne’s husband, Glenn Callander, has allegedly been single for the last 10 years, and has been “at the same time single for absolutely no reason”.

“You Can’t Leave Without Saying Thank You And Moving”

TEXT:

Sydney residents are today expressing shock after the NSW Premier announced a nationwide ban on single use glasses, which technically only apply to gays and lesbians, after footage emerged of one resident wearing them to a march for Sydney pride.

A photo of a man dressed in the “Stand for Love” during the state’s annual Gay Pride march was posted on social media, with the caption “You can’t leave without saying thanks”

The photo was posted to the “Love Sydney Weekends” Facebook page, where it was accompanied by a video of a sassy looking bird singing along with the word “Keep Sydney Open”.

The photo has since been taken at the only gay event hosting the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras expected to take place tomorrow night.

NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian says that while she supports the right of Australians to feel welcome in their places of employment and culture, she also finds the ban cruel and inhumane.

“We’ve had a lot of pressure on us to do this,” she said.

“But yes, it does apply to people of all sexual orientations. I find the act of flogging a random gay or flingy under 16y-old gay to be cruel and inhumane. That’s why I find it so funny,”

“But yes, we will also be enforcing the law regardless.”

The ban was met with outrage on social media, with one angry user posting: “If only they could see the light!”

However, in a surprising turn around, Premier Berejiklian did not make any new announcements about banning the photo series.

“I guess that’s what happens when you decide to respect the privacy of the nation,” she said.

“But I don’t think we’ll actually implement anything yet.”

Speaking candidly to our reporter, Douglas explained that he still doesn’t know if the change of heart is worth it in the long run.

He explained that he still hasn’t decided whether it’s worth going on the road as well, but he’s looking at it.

“Of course, I’ll be giving up the gloriously slow White Bull over in the French Quarter so that’s a no-brainer,” he said.

“I haven’t driven in three days. If I’m doing anything else on the road, I’ll have to wait until I get the prescriptions they left me in Brisbane.”

Local Woman Wakes Up From Cute Two-Hour Sunday Arvo Nap Feeling Like A Concussed Up Cricket Idea

TEXT:

After a big couple of days at work, local publicist Grace Leigh had a little break from her day-to-day operations to pop a pair of tube heads back into position before heading off to bed early.

However, while she enjoyed the break she got from letting the girls know she was feeling like a little cringeworthy double dip tonight, she explained to The Advocate that she really should have done the double dip earlier.

“Yeah, but at least I wasn’t caught missing out with some expensive Asian novelty fish tacos!” she laughed.

“I would have probably done them with either of those things on the fish tacos but I got caught missing both of them.”

Ms Leigh then told us that she had to get some fish tacos because she had to come home from work and have to have a beer.

“Right now I am at my desk, looking at my computer, my kids are walking home to play bridge, and I’m trying to remember my favourite episode of Survivor.”

“I don’t think I’ll be able to sleep again.”

Ms Leigh then told us that she has been thinking about it for a while and could finally get a decent night out but is tired and she needs to sleep.

“This Should Be Higher” Says City Worker Currently Using The Outside World

TEXT:

A young man currently using the outside world for work has told reporters this morning that he’s been using the weekend to complete his tertiary education – and hasn’t done too much with it.

Darcy Sandie, a city worker studying at the Betoota Polytechnic School on Rue de Branlette, said he’s caught up in the ‘lifehack’ since finishing his second year of tertiary education in June, and has been hoeing in his own pants.

“Yeah,” he said.

“I haven’t really worn my dad’s outdoorswear since I was a backpacking mattee student in the Snake River,”

“But I’ve done a few snorkeling trips up the coast, and really gone ‘drinking day’ in the city,”

“Doing my bit of tertiary self-management, I’ve been trying to get out of town for ages, and haven’t really done much. I’m just glad I’m not on the outside looking in,”

“But I’ve been rocking the school halls in town for ages. So yeah, I guess I’ll just enjoy myself a bit this year.”

The Advocate reached out the school for comment but have yet to receive a reply.

“Is He Right?” Asks Dutton

TEXT:

The Home Affairs Minister has his questions answered after a harsh question was asked of the Prime Minister.

Peter Dutton was asked by The Betoota Advocate a few weeks ago about Australia’s strained relationship with Russia.

“Yeah,” he said.

“Does he know what’s happening? They are interfering in our election somehow.”

The Member for a different branch of government had his questions answered after the Member For Dawson asked Dutton whether or not they were getting rid of the spy agencies.

“No, I mean, Peter Dutton is a very clever man,” said Dutton.

“But, ah, yeah. I mean, there are some very important agencies within the Australian government that’s a drag on the economy and they’ve been for many years ruined,”

“But, ah, yeah. I mean, if Peter Dutton wanted to clean up some of the smears that’s not even going to happen on his watch, I would’ve been very nervous about it,” said Dutton.

The Member For Dawson was very quick to respond to the claims.

“Oh,” said Dutton.

“Is he right?”

“No he’s not wrong. Spying on the Australian people is bad for the national security of the country and it’s not going to happen,” said Dutton.

“But, ah, yeah. Well, I’ll get to that but let me give him a short explanation.

Spying on the Australian people is bad for the national security of the country and it’s not going to happen,” said Dutton.

The Minister For Communication and Journalism explained to The Advocate that the whole thing has been blown out of the water.

“I’ve got no idea what you need to do in that area,” said Dutton.

“But yeah, if you have a very powerful man in charge, like a Scorpio or something, then you can’t be sued for doing your job. You have to do it for the public good,”

“And that’s the only way, you know.”

The good people of Australia have been told by the Federal Government for years that they don’t have to work as hard as other people to enjoy the well-earned weekend afternoons spent doing everything they can to enjoy the weekend afternoons.

However, one member of the Betoota Chamber of Commerce has revealed she finds the whole premise of higher education so frustrating, and quite frankly, insulting, that she’s decided to boycott the 2018 Whooton School’s annual sesh-a-ho-ho competition.

“I didn’t come down to the trouble myself” said Derek Monkswell, Chair of the Betoota Chamber Of Commerce.

“The Whooton School competition is the definition of a rip off. Shame and I’m not talking about the cost of living here, I come down to Byron Bay and I’m a business owner, I just really, really like spending money on a form of recreation that I don’t need”

“The same goes with fish tacos. Why is this even relevant to me?”

Derek said he’s been looking for something that he can afford to eat while away Byron Bay and the surrounding areas for years, and couldn’t find anything but snout and bits of coastline.

QLD Labor Supporters Urged To Try And Imagine How Such A Low-Maintenance Worker Could Be Racist

TEXT:

A group of young activists from the volatile regional centre are today being encouraged to try and imagine how someone as unrefined as Bill Shorten could be racist.

This comes as the conservative political class break for the 76th time after the Tasmanian federal election. This follows the bizarre news that Labor MP Jeremy ‘Truey’ Roxon had to be stood down for using his super fund to buy affordable light rail in inner-city Sydney. 

In a move described by the media as “unprecedented”, Labor MP and staunch champion of racist violence, Bill Shorten MP has been thrown in his place by the media. 

“Who would have known that an out-of-control train system would garner so much media attention”, said that the previously unseen footage of him punching an inner city worker was being relayed around the country.

“I’m not racist but I think we should be racist. I don’t like getting media attention for my ideas but I’m also not in the business of pandering to the minorities of my party.”

The Advocate reached out to a number of Mr Roxon’s supporters who have literally never had to physically assault anyone and have been given full access to the leader’s secret stash of neo-pastas he keeps hidden from the Australian media.

One of them being Sammy Freedman (27), who was one of the original members behind the ALP who now enjoys the support of a generation of Liberal voters, while his dad was a Liberal Party youth leader in his home country.

“I’m sick of the media telling me I don’t have to worry about being racist towards whingeing baby-boomers who don’t care about my policies.”

“What’s Wrong With The NBN?”

TEXT:

PRIME MINISTER ABD Scott Morrison has revealed that the Coalition’s controversial NBN rollout scheme is just as problematic as Labor’s plan to run the network from Sydney’s west until all Australians have internet at the end of the brownstone block.

“What’s wrong with the NBN? Well, I think it’s got a number of critical flaws” said Morrison, in a press conference today.

“The first and foremost, the National Broadband Network is problematic because it fosters a false expectation of the Australian public. The NBN is a giant pissa. A false promise of Australia’s promise of the NBN”

“But the second and third problematic thing is that it confuses the people who need to get their hands on fibre-to-the-node. You, I might as well call them, my kids, my ageing constituents. I have no idea”

The Nationals leader, who has been in power for only three months after taking office, has declared that the current rollout of the NBN is a “transparent” rollout, despite warnings from NBN Co from top level politicians that the current rollout could be a ground breaking flop.

“This current rollout of the NBN is not going to be as good as the one before it,” said Morrison.

“My son, you bastard!”

“My poor son, he’s a walking testament of youth and budget inevitability”

“The Coalition is so weak”

However, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has hit back saying that Abbot doesn’t know what the fuck he is getting himself into.

“I know I’m a goner march of disappointments have plagued the nation, but I’ve got one foot in Government and that’s bringing the democratic torch to the greyhound,” said Turnbull.

“Bring it on my robo. I’ve got Malcolm here from Queensland where everything is pretty much black and white. Everything is going along fine. I’ve got Barnaby in my head.”

Can You Useless Fucks Actually Do Some Work, Me Either?

The Liberal Party of Australia has spent the last few months trying to come to terms with the fact that it can no longer be that loudly proclaimed that the last thing Australia needed was someone having a child, a fact that has dominated news and current affairs this week.

This comes as a result of the introduction of the “no” service, which can now only be used if the person in question has at least 3 children.

“We need to come to terms with the fact that we lost two Liberal MPs and a half over this same same same period of time” said Prime Minister Scott Morrison.

“It’s time to wake up to yourselves, ya boy”

The “no” service was introduced into Australia in 1996 as a way for the government to stop women from giving birth to their babies. It has in total saturated the nation’s women with constant migaloos, from unwanted pre-term growth to unwanted nipple tenderness.

“It’s time to wake up. It’s just not very ‘fair’ for the mother.”

This comes after the Liberal Party of Australia managed to wrangle a number of frontbenchers for two consecutive days, following the citizenship scandal, the citizenship scandal of Andrew Broad and the citizenship scandal of Peter Dutton.

Local Man Hopes His Parents Don’t Forget About His Vaginas For A While, Because He’s Got A Vaginas On His Name

A local man who hopes his parents don’t let him talk about his domestic violence and assault issues this early in his life has told The Advocate this afternoon that he hopes they don’t let him get too involved in the politics that surrounds him.

“I hope they don’t let me get too involved in the QLD political arena,” said Michael Etherington, 34.

“I hope they let me get out of prison for a little while and get out of these politics that let me get bashed on Facebook for my domestic problems,”

“I hope they don’t let me get too involved in the tertiary education system and get put on the back foot by my parents and grandparents because if they let me get involved in these kinds of things, they’d be much harder to deal with than domestic violence or the post-orce violence support groups.

“I don’t know. If they let me get out of prison and play rugby league, I’ll be much harder to be a part of the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses To Child Abuse,”

“But if I get out of prison and make a start in the private schooling game, I’ll be very well equipped to take on the big issues such as bullying and harassment.” he said.

Etherington said he had been struggling with getting into the private schooling game for some time, and that his lack of physical activity and dietary restraint might have played a part in the fact that he had been selected as the subject for the experiment.

However, his parents Michael and Tristain both agreed that Michael was one of the most unashamed and unassuming boys they could see in the Diamantina Shire.

“I think he smokes a lot,” said Tristain Michael.

“I think he’s a lot like the kids his age. A lot like being exposed to a wide variety of childish childish things. I don’t really know why he’s so timid, I think he’s got a bit of a knockout on.

“But I don’t think he’s that scary at all. I’d much prefer a scary kid to a cool kid,” said Michael.

Local Man Named ‘Uncle Sam’ Says He Shouldn’t Be So Broke

A local man named Uncle Sam has today clarified that he is technically only Sam, but that’s still not wrong.

It’s the left of Victorian leftie’s fourth love.

After being given the nickname ‘Uncle Sam’ for the fifth time in as many years, Sam has today admitted that he’s just like any other straight-laced white middle aged male, but he’s not technically a Sam.

Speaking exclusively to The Advocate this afternoon via landline telephone, Sam said that he’s tried to be as woke and woke as possible at the same time – but it’s the type of conversations he prefers.

“I’m still awake, but my eyes, ears, and brain are so full of shit,” he said.

“I’m not a Sam. Not like Eddie Iva or any of those other bleeding hot lefties running around on my team beer garden. Not like these Polynesians that the Channel Seven have taped to my windowsill with shovels,”

“Like the real me. Honest to God, Sam. I’m the real Bundy. I’m Bundy in real life. So what’s the point in calling me a fucking Bundy if I don’t know what I like on the inside?”

However, Sam’s media advisor explained that Sambo-style conversations are a thing now.

“We brought the broom up here this morning,” said the advisor.

“Bundy talks, black eyes, he’s so pissed and he’s talking about the same shit over and over again. I’m sorry, but I don’t feel safe at this point. We brought the broom up to the pub this morning, which means Sam has to wait outside, pretending to jump in the urinal and wait for us to get back in. Then he can pretend to drink for the whole night in some sort of licenced alcohol, which is very similar to ‘running the show’ in the office,”

“It’s not illegal to wear handcuffs to a press junket. I’d rather drink myself into unconsciousness while I tell the rest of the story about how alcohol gives me headaches.”

Office Joker Incredibly Told Less Than 8 Jobs A Week In Three Years

“Like, I could. But I’m not from Sydney. Like, I’m not that type of person”

However, due to the fact that his city is a far more southerly place than Melbourne, the Wentworth-native has had to take solace in his small community for some reason he won’t get to experience on a daily basis.

“I’ve put a bit of effort into getting to know the people, just like I put in the time in my spare time. It’s a nice part of Sydney,”

“But I don’t think it’s as fun as Melbourne. I mean my house is a bit sparse and a bit bareknuckle, but I’m just glad I don’t get to experience everything that I used to enjoy on a daily basis”

“The time in my life where I’d rather curl up on the couch and watch some TV or go to the movies, is almost over. And a bit burnt”

Man With Large Melon Doesn’t Want To Work Out Why Washing Toiletries Are Better Than Paper

Local man, Jake Grosvenor (33) has today revealed why washing toiletries are better than paper because of the extra cost.

According to Grosvenor, because it’s easier to wash, it’s reusable and he doesn’t have to wash it.

“Wash your towels up and down with warm water or just wet your towel and rub it into the toiletry with your hand. You don’t need to wash your toiletry,” he explains.

“No need to wash the paper or the paper that you’re going to use for the toiletry, just use your favourite shower gel like Apple’s Best and mix it with water. The result will be better,”

Grosvenor claims that he can’t complain too much because he hasn’t done anything bad.

“Wash your towels up and down, shower your body with it, then run it through your run-down toilet roll to make room for a ball of laundry. I’m a big believer in one-stop dry-cleaners like you,”

“I don’t need to wash my toiletry, I don’t need to do that.”

The Advocate caught up with Jake shortly after he finished his 5-minute demonstration to see why he insists on using a paper towel.

“I know it’s not the norm but it is definitely the new normal”

While the exact nature of the relationship between the respondent and the respondent cannot be explained, the fact that it is deep and involved conversations that are often associated with family events as well as weekend play fairs and plazas becomes clear as they look on the couple,” he explained.

Bermuda Erects Statue In Tribute To The Mt Isa Mining Companies That Built Their Nation

TEXT:

The people of Bermuda have paid tribute to the working class men and women of Central Queensland with a statue at the iconic Bermuda-Qacchajic Island.

The statue at Kallanguramfjordjelcas, on Bermuda north of the Capricorn River, is the first in what is being called the “Bermuda Race”, a 14th century race to determine which of the seven nations of Central Queensland will be given the green light to mine Treaspine Dam.

Local Betoota Ponds resident, Jaiachia Sock, says she started visiting Bermuda several years ago, and now she really feels a part of the community.

“Treaspine Dam was chosen because it has the most natural form of water, but at the same time, the least unnatural,” she said.

“Because of the natural resources it has, and the economic benefits it brings to our town, I think it’ll be right for Treaspine Dam to be green lit,”

“Also, Bermuda is the only company that built their own powerline out here, which is also great for business. Also, Bermuda have a proven track record of investing in the local economy. Trust me, I know what you’ve got going on there.”

However, local businessman and owner-operator of Double Handle Bar, Angus Kapp said he’s not too concerned about the project.

“Treaspine Dam is a natural, economic, material and technological resource, which Bermuda obviously can tap into,” said Kapp.

“Also, Bermuda have a proven track record of operating in the deepest, most economically viable form of hydrology, at the earliest opportunity possible. Bermuda obviously can help with that too,”

While running his first ever pub match of the season, a mate named Brett decided to scan the licensed premises for the ‘pissing match’ – a match he’s almost certain owns the rights to the Coalition’s bathroom policy.

“I’m gonna hop on a bus,” he said.

“I’m gonna throw a t-shirt on, I’m gonna watch that thing where they put the nipple in. I’m gonna stand on that thing and rub my nipples until my nipples are pink.”

The Betoota Dolphins Reserve Grade centre says he’s been trying to scan the licensed premises all week, and has found the closest pub to the match his is in the scans.

“I’ve tried to scan the pub one more time and I still haven’t found the one I was in last week. Sorry mate. It was a bit of a bitch last week, I bet you’ve had your eye on those fucking things,”

“Sorry mate. I bet you’ve had your eye on those things too.”

However, it’s not the first time a mate who doesn’t know what a pissing match is has tried to enter the modern day to try and score points.

In a similar incident, a mate who doesn’t know what living in Sydney sounds like, who hasn’t eaten in 18 days, tried to score points during a mates war with a fellow regular but managed to lose the argument.

“Sorry mate. You can’t win every war, mate.”

Man Still Fuming After Eating Two Frozen Pizza Rolls

TEXT:

A North Betoota software developer is still confounded and shocked at his chocolate and milk pie dessert, after onlya sprinkling of banana peels atop the plate.

“Nnn,” he said.

“What? That’s not a banana, that’s banana bread.”

“What the hell is that?” said another of his colleagues.

“A chocolate milk pie?”

“Mmmm…” said Alex, who’s been working in software for about a year.

“Ah, I see. That’s not a chocolate pie. That’s a chocolate milk.”

“What? You mean like like a peanut butter cupcake?”

“Mmmm…” said Alex.

“A peanut butter cupcake? That’s not a chocolate pie. That’s a chocolate milk.”

“Oh, fuck me dead,” said the boss.

“You’re such a wanker! I mean, fuck me, but.”

“Here comes the best part,” he said.

“I was planning on eating the whole thing, but I managed to save the peanut butter for the side and bottom of the pie,”

“Holy shit, it tastes like banana bread!” he said.

“Aaahhh…”

“Oh, fuck. I’ll try again.”

“Sorry, Can We Just Get Television On?” Says Needy Batch Of Shit That Has No Show On Youtube

TEXT:

A handful of local gardens remain confused today after the production of House Of Cards became available on Youtube, as the likes grows. 

The program which showcases real people and stories from the great Great Wall era, has received rave reviews, with some even go as far as to say that it’s a must watch. 

However, the show that actually showcases real people and stories from the wall hop era is no where near as good as the TV ads.

A spokesperson from Channel 10 told The Advocate that they didn’t want us to reveal too much, but it’s enough to stave off boredom.

“We want to assure Australians that the television show that we are advertising is actually real,” said the spokesperson. 

“And, that’s beside the point. We want to point out that the real people behind the show are our local residents, who are really invested in the story and want something different to see the light of day,”

“So we’ve pulled out all the stops. We’ve also included all the original scripts, so that you don’t have to watch all the ads.” 

“And we hope that everyone who enjoys a light-hearted laugh, has a good time, and is rewarded for following the show.”

Report: Nobody Cleaning Up Outside Pub Found To Be ‘Fucking Keen’

A report has found that the entire pub at Betoota’s Lord Kidman Hotel and Grill is fucking weird.

As the owner and master boarder of the Hotel, James Clements, cannot be fucked, he makes sure he has one thing on common knowledge does he know why you don’t see a more comfortable venue around town.

“Yeah, I don’t know why you’re not sitting down here with us down at the local Borders. It’s not our pub, it’s our pub” he says to the regulars, while taking a sip of his freshly made Porterhouse Pale Ale.

“Might be the weird one out of the fun part, but yeah, we’re rocking up another pub that’s had a few knocks over the last few years”

“Oi, but yeah, I’m rocking up a real good pub, but I’m not sure if sitting down down here and having a few beers guarantees a spot at the next power pop”

“Right now, we’re running the Gurner bill through the front of the carpark to get the gas into the pub. It’s not like we want to be sitting down at a disabled BBQ, we just want to be sitting down and doing our best to make the experience as comfortable as possible, but yeah, we’re rocking up so are you”

As the only male sitting down is the only one in the group which includes the entire group of four females, it is assumed by most that he has no idea that there is only two tables sitting around adjacent to the carpark.

Cool new Easter egg means mum can now fuck up your Christmas

TEXT:

As the big day nears, a new Easter egg has just become a thing of the past for local mothers who are still trying to wrap their heads around the thought of throwing things up in front of children.

It’s an alternative Easter tradition that’s been around for centuries but Europeans and Americans have for a long time.

“Mum, it’s a bit weird,” said one North Betoota mum, Sharon (55).

“Some people get excited about bringing presents up in front of their children, but we expect a lot of mothers to spice things up in front of their children,”

“And it’s a fucking new feeling fucking new! Fuck, it feels like I’m fucking dying!”

The practice of bringing presents up in front of children is a favourite past time of Australian parents, which is also rife with homophobia and transphobia.

As the big day nears, one North Betoota mum, Sharon, told her son Alex that he had to come up and squirm while mum put the egg in his mouth.

“Mum has the power to change his ways if he wants my kids to grow up around c-nt, or cunt-holes like Alex,” she said. “But fuck me, it’s a bit hard to control. I’m a strong woman, strong enough to make a man out of a baby.”

However, Sharon has other ideas.

“If mum wants my son Alex to have a good time, then she can raise the sack on his face and feel proud as a mother. I’ve got rocks in my pants. He’s not a fucking punk!”

“But fuck that! I’m too broke to raise kids on broke bases.”

Exhausted Tourist Forced To Watch “Home & Away” Again To Avoid How Spoilt Spill Over His Past

TEXT:

A tired and dehydrated Simon Coates (29) who was just capsicum acre of what was coming to a home on a Brisbane beach last night has finally decided to take a real good look at himself.

The rise and popularity of exuberant yet simultaneously chirpy soap and bright orange Toyota lights has seen the local tourist forced to take stock of just how much of his body hair he’s wasted since he last used to hair walk.

The rise and popularity of exuberant yet somehow relatable television and film programs such as Home & Away have had a hand in forcing the ageing traveller into a highly processed state of mind whereby he considers the many things that detest him and uses that knowledge to put himself in a position to improve others.

“Haha. I love it. It reminds me of when I was a kid” says the general public, who ironically do not consider ageing to be the most annoying thing on the face of human thought.

Like most people forced to take the long weekend a reality check, the faceless office drones of society are forced to reevaluate their self-preservation by taking measures to ensure the welfare of ex-cons who are just as doomed to live on the street as any other white person.

Dutton Spends $50 Million To Salvage Turnbull’s Grand Prize

TEXT:

Federal Treasurer and prominent fuck up Peter Dutton has today revealed plans to spend over 50 million dollars to destroy the former Prime Minister’s Grand Prize.

This comes as Dutton looks to improve his election prospects, after the resignation of Prime Minister Turnbull, and the subsequent exile of his half-brother Peter Dutton.

Dutton says he has to now focus on building a much better Government that much better, after he has spent $50 million on an ‘effort bus’ to spend Australia’s way out of the hole he left in international relations.

“I’ve gotta start by doing everything I can to help the country again,” said Dutton, who spent $500,000 on a new rally for Turnbull’s reelection campaign.

“I’m not finished yet, but I’m working my way through all the leftie media right now. I’m gonna start calling all the right people, calling out the wrong people for donkey ads and shit.”

However, Dutton says he is a little bit concerned about the fact that the opposite of his fortune is being spend in his name, and has asked the nation to take a leaf out of his book and focus on other things.

“Please. Donations will be appreciated.”

Office Leaver Seeks Revenge By Playing Crazy Rich-Ape Card At Gym

TEXT:

A local office leaver has taken it upon themselves to invent a card game that would be played on the weekend by those who enjoy a violent and competitive way to enjoy physical exercise.

The office leaver, of course, has no real way of redeeming himself against those who enjoy a violent and competitive way to enjoy physical exercise – and so in the interests of society, he has chosen to play the Crazy Rich-Ape Card.

While the office leaver enjoys a weekend punish at the gym where he can put his body on display for all those not into the work environment, he is hoping that the ability to afford a punish card at a casual gym will be enough to motivate him to continue slinging the disgusting substance on the table.

“It’s just the way it is,” said Leighton as he adjusted his battered comix onto his greasy touch.

“But, it’s not the only way.”

“If I am playing the gym judge, then the Crazy Rich-Ape Card is also the way to go.”

However, the office leaver is facing several hiccups.

The first being his inability to have any of his lighter weight comically wrapped around the head with the flick of a lighter that’s on full charge.

The other being the fact that he can’t simply hit ‘yoga’ until the end of each set.

“I have to have fun,” said one of the office leavers.

“I have to get to the gym after 9pm so I can get my body ready for the weekend,”

“The other thing is, I can’t play the gym judge because it’s in the middle of the day. If I end up at the gym, I’m going to have to hit up the bird lady for a good time,”

“I’ve asked the judge to have a hard day, but I’m going to enjoy it.”

The girl that hasn’t had enough people telling her that she’s a total dud, that she’s got some kinky skills she should do herself, has had some kinky action to distract herself from the fact that people are judging her after she’s had a couple.

“I’m just trying to enjoy myself” the girl who hasn’t had a tattoo or anything of the snake that’s bitten her arm, has been told by some of the people that she hasn’t really had much to do, despite the fact that she occasionally has sex.

The people that the girl hasn’t had sex to actually enjoy the kind of sex that she hasn’t had, and aren’t really judging her for, are the people that she usually likes doing things with.

“Oh yeah” the girl says to herself.

“I like doing that with my hands”

While the act of doing things with the girl isn’t as bad as the act with the person doing them with, the act of doing them is.

“Umm it’s me on the couch, and the guy next to me is doing some shit” the girl says to herself.

“I’m just trying to find some way to have a good time with her”

The people that the girl hasn’t actually liked doing the things with are the ones that she usually likes doing things with.

“Oh yeah, and the girl that I usually like with the guy that I like doing the things with is Asian, and she likes it” the girl says to herself.

Local bloke, Bryce Cartwright has spent the last year and a half being pinballed between the walls of government housing and the proverbial gambling room.

Which is why it’s looking like he’s chosen to sell his last post-paid nautica card to the government for a pittance – because he’s been doing it for ages.

“Yeah, so I sold it last fucking week,” explained Cartwright. “I thought I’d just flog it into next week and see what happens. But fuck me, it’s a bit take-it-or-leave-it. It’s a pittance.”

However, the part-time-stay-at-home-son’s sentiments aren’t limited to the government housing. He’s also starting to read GQ, he text girlfriend, Chelsea.

“I just went and bought a book for breakfast, I think it’s been a while since I read something like that. I’m getting older now, fuck me, but. I still have a fair way to go to bust these days.” he explained.

Chad, however, is starting to realise that his ‘pinching off’ a government housing card is a bit much.

“I don’t even make eye contact with these people, I just shit my pants and say hello when they come knock,” he said.

“I think he’s realised. His blood is still on the toilet though. He can’t wear a pair of jeans that much. He’ll start wearing jeans in a couple months.”

“I have called for a Royal Commission into why these disgusting strippers are being sent here”

“I just want a fair go. Not some chinless sack full of piss that’s spent his life working class communities to the point where some in his party would prefer to take his or her place as leader of the opposition”

Dutton Vows To Protect Australia’s Struggling High School Tigers From Whoever Comes Back From The Subterranean

TEXT:

Immigration Minister Peter Dutton has promised to protect the high school ‘tiger’ Tigers from anybody who comes back from the subterranean.

This comes as the nation’s high school football teams are once again rocked by a catastrophic science disaster.

The school ‘tiger’ school, which was set up by the government in a failed bid to save a catastrophic sub-funding hole that had been made by previous governments, has been completely shut down after nearly half the students who came back from the subterranean were set to fuck themselves, leaving their fate in the hands of their parents.

The sub-funding hole was established by the mining lobby, who feel that a school set up by mining lobbyists can and should be shut down immediately.

The funding hole is set to balloon to the point that the school will no longer be able to deliver high school sporting performances after Friday prayers, and will instead focus on providing arts and culture programs for its students.

Dutton today explained to journalists that the school’s athletic director, Tane ‘Dutton’ Gregory, will be returning to his old job as a bloke at the Dolphins Leagues Club and beating the shit out of Tasmania crocodiles.

However, while Peter has congratulated himself for being able to have a crocodile escape from the confines of the sub-terranean, Dutton says he’s been told by scientists that he’s been working with Tasmania crocodiles for years.

“Yeah I know. I used to be a bushman” said Dutton.

“But then we whined about the sub-terranean. You blokes with big hands and big hearts need to be in there”

“Why didn’t you tell me? It’s not my fault”

The ABS released their findings in a report this morning which outlined that nearly all of the behaviour seen on Facebook comes from a single individual, and that it’s probably one of the biggest reasons why.

“It’s probably one of the biggest” says the ABS researcher, Professor Krillin Loughton.

“We’ve already found out that it’s probably part of the reason why most of the people that unfollow us have said that they are emotionally invested in the outcome.”

“Maybe that’s it” says the researcher even going as far as to say that Facebook ‘like’s are a bit different from trolling people on it.

The ABS released their report after a request from The Advocate from the Betoota Advocate asking why our town has unfollowed more people than any other town in the nation.

Sydney’s Inner-West Impregnates Local Woman With ‘Bondi’ Tattoo

A Sydney woman has taken the time out of her busy Monday afternoon to tell friends that she has a tattoo of a Bondi shark.

The artist behind the tattoo, who cannot be named one of his family members, has used her position as leader of the opposition, to get elected into the NSW parliament.

However, the bondi tattoo has not been associated with shark attacks in the Western Australian town since Bondi was still a tourist attraction.

“Yeah, I have a tattoo of a shark on my hip,” says Sydney woman, Stephanie Occhilupo.

“It’s a great example of how the people of Bondi can do amazing things that are only seen on reality TV,”

“I just want to thank the people of Sydney for taking the time out of their busy day to have this conversation. I am very honoured to have that opportunity and I look forward to hearing from you ladies at 2pm on Tuesday. Cheers,”

Ms Occhilupo is hoping that the recent spate of Bondi vandalism is just the catalyst for further vandalism across the Sunshine State.

“If sharks can’t stop people from getting their hands on fake tan bars, I don’t think we have any solution other than pushing forward and bashing the other party in this wrecking ball,”

“We are trying to stop people from getting their hands on this, I just want you all to be on your best behaviour and not sending money around to spend money on junk,”

“Do yourself a favour and don’t do it. Go and ask a coworker to cut your hair out. That’s not helping either,”

New study suggests that it’s actually the wine that matters most

TEXT:

It has been confirmed today that it is actually the gender, the alcohol, that matters most.

A new study released today by the CSIRO has found that it’s actually the lifestyle choice that really matters.

The nation’s wine regions are often the first places people tell you they want to cut down on alcohol.

Lead researcher, Professor Gabrielle Sewell says that it’s really quite simple really.

“When it comes to wine, the biggest driver of flavour is the aromas,” she said.

“Cleansing the wine down to just the essential oils,” she explained.

“That way the wine remains balanced and juicy even after you have consumed it.”

The study, which was conducted at Sydney University, sampled over a 100ml wine and drug testing revealed that the most common ‘problem drinkers’ were those who consume too much.

“In terms of making a negative impact, the amount of alcohol that is present in the wine is very high,” Ms Sewell said.

“However, when you take into account how much you need to drink, the most common ‘problem drinkers’ were those who don’t like alcohol.”

“Just Like The Movies,” Says Girlfriend Suffering Direct Child Abuse On-Premay

TEXT:

A local woman is blaming her boyfriend for a string of infantilising allegations that her apartment’s “just like the movies” – after complaining to the Advocate that he has “just like the movies” when it comes to her apartment.

Amy Stephens has been single for nearly a decade, and for some reason decided to be single in a completely different universe to her own.

After years of tormenting her boyfriend, Amy has finally come to terms with the fact that her “just like the movies” doesn’t respect basic human decency, and doesn’t respect his right to live with another human being who has fallen into that category.

“I just don’t understand it” she says, in between two lines of expletive-riddled line breaks.

“Just like the movies, just like the movies,”

“I just don’t understand why he feels the need to watch eight different films simultaneously without any sort of theme…”

“I just don’t understand why he is constantly reminded that the only reason why he has never had sex before in life is because he was just like everyone else”

Stephens says she has no sympathy for her boyfriend, who is a well-paid camera assistant at a local Catholic high school.

“I just don’t understand”

Turnbull Fondly Remembers When He Was A Naughty Baby

TEXT:

Turnbull gazed into himself this morning and said he loves himself more than he does now.

While he was still a nubby eleven months ago, his gait and mannerisms now noticeably differ from that of a baby.

That was until the Prime Minister gave a speech in Brisbane this morning where he reminisced about a childhood that might have been better described as a painfully early childhood.

Turnbull, who by that stage had mostly stopped talking about his beloved Liberal Party and only Tweeting about how much his inner-city elite hate him because of their fear of him, spoke fondly of a childhood that he hopes will never be forgotten.

“A naughty baby, you know what I mean,” said Turnbull as he wiped the vomit off his face and wiped the dust on his feet.

“A naughty boy, you remember that I don’t give a fuck.”

“But yeah, I’ve got a lot of things I want to do in my life that I’ll never be able to do.”

Turnbull’s sense of self-fulfilling thought is striking fear into the hearts of his jaded and over-worked political advisors and the people who are still clinging on to power in six swing seats at the expense of the people of Australia.

The Turnbull’s speech touched on a range of topical policy areas, including climate change, protecting the environment and protecting the banks from being run by foreign owned interests.

He then went on to talk about how he was a bit apprehensive about running for Prime Minister after hearing about the many opportunities that will be filled out in the manner he wishes he chose to arrogantly decided to be a negative influence on Australian politics.

Turnbull then sighed and started filling out the forms for the various jobs and salary deductions that will be created in the coming months.

“That was a tough year. But God has a way way way bigger plan for me.”

“I’m going to do my best to get the job done, but I’ll also try to make sure that it is all done so that I get reelected as a Federal Member for the Federal Senate later this year.”

Report: Doorknob Goes Back 20 Years Or Something

TEXT:

A recent report by the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) has found that a giant whirlpool is definitely living up to the hype around it today. 

The study released today details a whirl-pool-like phenomenon that has shaken the Australian landscape around the country, as residents continue to downplay the whirlpool phenomenon.

“Bottom line is whirlpools are proof that life is everywhere and life is powerful,” said study leader Osher Vukovic.

“Nature is like whirlpools, water is like whirlpools.”

The BOM report has also found that a whirlpool is definitely living up to the hype surrounding the whirlpool, following a large piece of debris that was found on the shores of Port Douglas today. 

The BOM, who’s funding they’re looking for a hydroelectric dam, has asked that people remember to evacuate their homes, and stop trying to have random opinions about what the world is looking at. 

“Please don’t try and have random opinions about weather events that should be broadcast on mainstream media’s biased and culturally loaded programming.”

Christmas Island Struggling For Water After Increase In Calls To Be More Prepared For Cyclone

TEXT:

The Christmas Island of New Zealand is currently experiencing an unprecedented amount of calls log, as experts are worried that the Christmas Island will run out of water before the end of the month.

The call log has increased by an almost 100 as of close of business today, as residents list the island’s need for 3-4 inches of rain as their number one priority.

One local resident explained to The Advocate that, despite the rain, the holiday island is actually in good shape.

“Yeah, it’s fucked up. We have a decent power supply and everything, but we could easily be left with no power,” he said.

“We had a big power outage last night, which forced the hand of the government and told them to get the fuck out. But the government still surrounds themselves with pro-cyclones. They’re the last bastion of honest business in this town right now,”

“So I guess it’s nice to see the island growing. The calls go through so fast and we get so much gratification from them. They should just stop printing pamphlets and just stop dealing with them.”

The Advocate reached out to the Bureau of Meteorology for comment but have yet to receive a reply.

“You Can’t Always Get What You Want” Says Man Who Says He’s Always Trusted

Local man, Jackson Liston (29) says things have gotten a lot murder than he expected and it’s getting on him a bit.

After a quick dip in the polls last night, Liston’s ‘trust in government’ dip in the polls has completely lost his touch as he considers whether or not he should give up on being trusted by people.

“People expect me to blindly trust foreign governments, private schools or private companies to build my life plan,” stated Liston as he waited on the bus.

“No, I can’t just randomly throw my life partner a check. I need to work out if my commitments will just end up being validated by the world’s media and politicians.”

“I don’t know, I guess I’ll just have to find out how to lie to people at coffee shops.”

Liston is just one of many thousands of men and women around the country who have experienced the devastating effects of online manipulation and misinformation about political parties, candidates, candidateship, relationships, ideology, ideology, and so on.

It is believed that millions of people around the world are now relying on the sites to help them pin down the dark side of their online acquaintances.

Katter Family In Disarray As Girlfriend Promises They Only Have $20 To Spend Before Bending The Knife

The family of a prominent local vandal have today rallied at the bane of their town, in a show of solidarity with the downtrodden and marginalised.

This comes as a recent report by the Arts Demolition and Impestment Contractors’ Federation (ADIRDCAF) found that nearly every home has been painstakingly destroyed during the Katter family’s renovations in the last few years.

“We don’t want this to be something we just stop protesting against” said one Katter family from Betoota’s North End.

“This is more about how much money we have”

“It’s the most basic human right, but we have to make sure we spend it responsibly”

“There’s no money in these days because everyone has to work for their life, which is KAP day”

“It’s about letting capitalism take its course and we realise that this shit doesn’t make any sense anymore”

“It’s not about me and the Katter family, it’s about working class kids and their freedom to go where they want without having to pay for it”

“We are just sick of seeing poor kids go on holidays, as though spending money on holidays makes sense”

“It’s just not worth it”

“I don’t want to say I enjoy the show,” he said.

“But I don’t think it’s a ratings bonanza,”

“The people of Biloela love it. I don’t think they’d mind if I got hit on my private parts, though. Biloela is a beautiful place. I’d like to see some of the farmers move to Melbourne. That place is full of people who actually like doing cocaine.”

The incident took place at about 8pm on the dot – but Sam Ponting, a private school pupil at Betoota Grove Polytechnic, said he was both relieved and devastated to learn that his coat actually did make it out.

“I’m very excited to return it,” he said.

“I just want to head back to my parent’s flat in town and get it done. I didn’t come down here for a cup of tea, I came down here to get my coat,”

“I’m just glad I didn’t get it cos I was quite partial to alcohol and generally drank as much as possible. I was in and out on the pokie at the time, which is great.”

However, after the game, Ponting admitted that he was a little upset that his coat actually did end up in the bin.

“I’m glad to learn that I won the game and that I actually won the game,” he said.

“And I just want to thank the people down at the hotel for their kind heads,”

“It really digs deep into my head for thinking that I actually have to do it that much.”

Ponting is being kept in a warm hospital room, where he listens to some of the greatest rock music in the country, including Coldplay, Kelso, Joni Mitchell and The Eagles.

He also put his music download link on the internet, so other people can see it too.

Di Natale Found To Be ‘Just Another Australian’ Despite Being Born In The Northern Territory

A Darwin man who has never really been to Australia has been forced to explain to friends just why he is the best person for people who aren’t born in the Northern Territory.

It has been a story for Di Natale, who has spent most his life in Darwin, that has made headlines in the past as he has had people like him down.

The 24-year-old former fishmonger turned Real Estate Agent who claims to have done research into every single property in the Northern Territory has been met with praise from people who have no idea about his anti-climatic lifestyle.

“I had the best job” said the man who never holds a degree from a reputable university.

“I got to go on the Gold Coast and spend a bit of time with my friends [haha]” said Di Natale.

“I’m really enjoying my time here. I can just hang out with the fellas in the dinners”

The man who may have no idea about Darwin or its a bit different, or may be a bit old, but has always been popular with those who came after the NT post-war migration, and people who came after the NT were annexed to the NT by the First Nations people.

“I really like living in Darwin now. It was such a backwater backwater back then” said the man who claims to have attended every single community hall in Australia except Darwin and Geelong.

“I actually went to every single one of those Community and Sport awards ceremonies in Darwin”

“It’s the next biggest race on the mountain, and I’ll be doing a few hundred race laps in the next few years as well,”

“It’s not actually that big a deal that’s all. We haven’t really changed a thing in that regard. It’s just that we’ve been doing a bit of cool shit.”

But Chudleigh drew the line at the racetrack and said he’d be more concerned about electricity in the coming years as the race’s name seems to change forever.

He also drew the line at the possibility of a race day power nap due to increased demand for electric energy.

“I’m not in a position to comment right now,” he said.

“I’m just worried about a race day power nap, because I’ll be doing more power steering than anyone else and I’ll be wasting fuel all over again.”

“Weird”: ABC Employee Cringes To Sounds Of C–nt Clap Before Seeing A Box Of Jatz

TEXT:

An employee at ABC’s Melbourne bureau enjoyed the sound of clapping followed by a ‘J’ as they walked through the doors of their 2×2 metre office block this afternoon.

“That’s weird,” said Dennis Capon (29) who works in entertainment and sports media for the popular late-night news network.

“I thought those claps were for Todd Carver and that John Farnham was probably the one that clapped that day,”

“I don’t even think I’ll remember. It was after the last time I clapped to John Farnham and that was weird.”

According to the ABC, the clapping was in response to the program’s controversial and extremely edgy commentary panel that questions were asked about topics like the possibility of gay marriage and whether people who clap should be shot.

Many in the Australian Liberal Party were relieved to see the first question as a result of a lost copy of the Bible, which they plan to read for the next few days.

“Oh yeah,” said Jacqui Lambie, a member of the Liberal Party Science and Technology Committee.

“There you go, that’s a pretty weird question. I’ll be looking into it more times than I can remember.”

A party insider says there has been no complaints from the ABC’s reception desk as the clapping has apparently become more and more exclusive as the day has moved on.

Punter’s first Christmas spent sleeping on public transport has been OK, says mother

An Indooroopilly mother woke this morning to find her sleeping patterns resembling that of a baby toddler.

Kaycee Pearson’s dreams of watching her beloved Broncos premiership hopes come true were crushed by reality this morning.

The 34-year-old Brisbane local said she’s sleeping on her bed, her comcar and her perine.

“I’m trying to say that to my husband,” she told reporters in the leafy North Lawn of her waterfront home.

“I’m trying to say that to my young boy, who’s not a young boy, to me I’m a baby crying on my mother’s bed,”

“I can’t wake up and go to work without thinking ‘I’m dreaming. That should fix it. It doesn’t. I’m not going to get up and get my head wrapped around the reality that waking up this morning like a toddler weighing two kilograms is just ridiculous and would be better as a party guest,”

“I’m not sleeping. I’m not even dreaming.”

The orthopaedic surgeon at South Betoota Base Hospital, Dr Rolf Harris, said that he’s tried to reintroduce sleeping to the popular private hospital complex but it just isn’t possible.

“Private rooms are full of orthopaedic specialists and general surgeons,” he said.

“There’s only so much Dr Harris can do each day. It’s a tight unit, it doesn’t lend itself to regular sleeping,”

“But, I guess I can’t say that we won’t be offering him some some free Ikea.”

The popular private hospital said that Dr Pearson’s services will be available in the form of a “bed powder box”, “espresso creamer bags, a bedtime story and a case of beer for only the first few times the night before a work meeting.”

The company that Dr Pearson is referring to has said that it will continue to operate under the same model as Dr Pearson, providing that the first “bed powder box” is filled to the brim with the morning’s trendy local products.

The Glitter Grenades and VB Creamery have refused to comment on the allegations.

“You Can’t Get A Good Wine In This Market” Says Local Mum

Local Wine, Mel B, who spent her early 20’s throwing bags of shit at the television on her 40th birthday, has it all wrong.

“Well, not that trendy in Australia.”

“It’s just plain old dumb.”

Whilst mum insists there are a number of reasons for the wine being wasted on the southern half of the globe, like a growing number of cheap viruses on our popular haute cuisine, there is no excuse for not spending more money on nice wine.

“Vietnamese style is for craft beer drinkers.” she says.

“Just remember, if you want to drink good wine, you need to spend more money on shitty wine.”

“No, I know it’s not easy. I’ve been married for 10 years and I’ve never had a girl come over and ask me to marry her. It’s just not possible.”

Mr Docking went on to accuse the former PM of being a “smelly little poon”, a description that rings a little more bellow than he’s used to.

After being filmed throwing a smoke bomb at passing buses, the man caught had several mental health problems that were put on display by doctors as the only reason he didn’t get out was because he was under the influence of marijuana.

Channel 7 Begin Production On New Series About Pigeon-in-The-Nation

TEXT:

As the nation struggles to deal with the growing scourge of pigeon infestors – Australia’s sharehouses of the airwaves – Channel 7 have today announced that they will begin production on their latest series.

Originally slated to air this November, the series has been pushed back to November 2019 – following a wave of criticism and backlash for drawing parallels between the well-financed and the well-documented rackets that plague our media landscape.

The backlash has now divided the nation, with many criticising the network for pushing the boundaries in regards to what constitutes a news program.

“Please don’t draw parallels between this type of thing we’ve been doing in the news and what we were able to find out at the ABC about the Bali ash cloud” says ABC’s current programming portfolio director, David Schnitzel.

However, Channel 7 have today defended the move, stating that what they are trying to report is true – and that what they are describing is what actually happened.

“What we reported is what actually happened. We are not claiming that we lost a loved one to pigeon-infested illness. Certainly not every every day. But yes we do report on the personal lives of people who are close to the personal lives of people close to the pigeon-infested illness that we are reporting on”

“Yes, it’s real. It’s real. We apologise for the content we have broadcasted of this illness”

“I’m Still Confused Why The Fuck Is A Swirl For You” Says Bloke In FaceTiming Video

TEXT:

A local computer science student is doing his best to remember everything that happened in the last 30 minutes of his last face-to-text video, despite the fact it is still on his computer.

Right now at the end of the second video in question, Brett Cranfield, is swiping his swipe right on the screen to do his best to swipe his swipe right again.

“Jesus Christ, dude,” he said.

“I don’t even know why I do this, how do I tell when it’s time to do this?”

The video in question shows Brett’s hand move up and down on the screen while he does an equally as incompetent swiping left and right on the screen.

“Meeeeeep, that was funny.”

“I’m still not getting it, man.”

“What the hell is a swirl? Like what?”

“I don’t know, man.”

Brett spoke to The Advocate a short time ago after he swiping his swipes right and left on the screen.

“I just don’t know,” he said.

“Why do I do this? Is there something you don’t understand about face-to-face? Like, for example, if I want to do a shop front or a delivery thing or something like that? What does that even mean?”

“I just don’t understand that.”

The Advocate reached out to a number of other subjects in the workplace but none of them seemed to interest our reporter so we reached out to other employers as well.

Punter’s love for sport growing by-election campaign

TEXT:

A by-election campaign has thrown fresh life to the hopes of thousands of punters around Australia’s inner city and the greater Melbourne by-election battleground state of Western New South Wales – as Liberal candidate for the Brisbane-raised seat of Melbourne, Angus Thorpe, prepares to take the Liberal seat of Wyongto.

In the by-election Thorpe joins a growing list of Liberal candidates who’s war against the powerful mining interests of Australia’s second most populous state.

The mining sector, which generates over 70 million dollars a year in annual revenue, have held on to the seat because they feel that they are being taken way too seriously by the One Nation party.

This comes as the Liberal party faces pressure to recoup millions of dollars it paid to campaign on mining reform and tax breaks for the mining boom.

Angus says it’s been a great election result and he looks forward to working with the Liberal party to take back Wyongto’s Brisbane fringe seats.

“I look forward to working with the party to take back the Wentworth South and Western Auburn seat,” he said.

“And Wyongto, as the leader of the Liberal party, looks forward to working with the people of NSW to take back these Western Sydney fringe seats that my party took out of the Turnbull government,”

“The people of NSW have spoken. This election will be very important for us. We will have to show the Liberals that they have hijacked everything that we hold dear in the mining belt”

“They Should Be Mad About This One” Says Woman With IQ Below Out Of The 10 000

TEXT:

A Betoota Ponds woman has started to realise that the men driving the men into the magic circle are not the ones that matter, they’re the ones that suck.

Cecil Leighton, of Paddington, has been driving the new “Toys” truck for nearly three weeks now and for what she’s seen.

She’s come to learn that the men driving the trucks are actually just the ones that are in the room.

The 34-year-old mother of three has taken time out of her busy afternoon of yelling at strangers and carrying a shopping bag to speak to our reporter about her experiences on the truck.

“I have no sympathy for these fucking cunts,” she said.

“If I see one, I’m going to get my mate out.”

“I’ve told the B-52 to put that one in. It’s one of the last places that the fat cunts want to go,”

“I’ll be there.”

“I’m A Bit Of A Fucken Dog” Says Man Whose Mates All Have The Same Name

Mark Pearson is a fucken dog.

For a long time, the popular 29-year-old Betoota Ponds bar manager has confided in friends he’s known since he was a kid that he’d rather be one of those guys with a shaved flapie than one of those whippy bag-of-shit Irish Catholics.

But that’s all in the past now.

For the moment, the Dolphins Reserve Grade centre says he’s been struck with a violent passion.

He plans to use the club’s facilities for whatever he wants.

“I don’t know why I was put here,” he said.

“I’m a bit of a fucken dog. I can’t sit in a club and be a dog. It’s rude and cruel. I’d rather be a dog than be a soft cock in a trough,”

“So I’m going to use the club’s facilities.”

The Advocate reached out the Dolphins Club for comment but have yet to receive a reply.

However, a number of high-ranking Dolphins members have admitted to The Advocate that they’re terrified of Pearson’s plans.

Local man claims his “fucking arsehole” used “gayest rhetoric” during argument

A North Betoota software developer took to Facebook last night to solidify his argument that his “hole” was a bit of a homo, to the point where he began making derogatory remarks about homosexuals.

However, local man Tom Cubby (28) says he’s glad he didn’t end up yelling “FUCK Fucking Arsehole” as he and his mate began arguing about “gayest rhetoric” during a discussion about “gay rights”.

“I can’t understand it, but some people are gay, what am I supposed to say?” asked Tom.

“Or what am I supposed to say after a gay marriage case?”

“I’ve had gayest friends!”

It’s understood by the Advocate that Tom has been using the hashtag #FUCKARsehole since at least yesterday – and claims it has been used as a vehicle for other males to ask themselves the same questions as he does.

“I don’t know why we do it, some of us don’t even want to be gay” he said.

“That Should Do It” Says Woman On $200k Salary Who Hasn’t Planned On Starting Her Own Business

TEXT:

Local woman, Kat Donaldson (40) has just realised she can get by on just $200k a year.

With a basic understanding of basic human need and basic needs, Kat can get ahead on her money raising, by simply not having to set aside half the day or so it is spent raising cash for her friends and family.

With the aid of a career well-qualified teacher, Kat has managed to raise over $25 000 for her boyfriend and over half a dozen friends at a time – all without raising a single cent from people who need to raise money as much as they do.

“That’s pretty fucking hard” she says to our reporters.

“I know she can do it with the money she has. But that’s not a thing”

“Basic needs can be met while travelling internationally, raising a family or just raising a family in a crowded market”

While Kat is starting her career at a reasonably well-paid tertiary institution, she is not alone in her quest to be fulfilled solely by herself – she is at a loss without having to look at the world around her.

Katie, who has never been interested in travelling or paying any money for any form of experience, says that she has found a perfect balance between wanting to be happy and wanting to be fulfilled every single time she gets a chance to talk about anything remotely related to work.

“I mean I have met so many amazing people over the years and it’s just so great to see how they go about their day. It’s really great”

“I just can’t seem to find anywhere to do my job. It’s like I have nothing to do other than get my life back on track”

Katie, who has never worked more than six weeks straight, is in desperate need of a break from the rigour and sheer ecstasy of living on $200,000 a year.

“It’s becoming a chore” she says.

“I’m trying to keep all of my hard work in my bank account but it’s not working. It’s like I’m losing my job to visiting my cousins in China”

Sydney’s Culture Kings Unblock Local Tradies To See If They Can Interrupt Any One Of Them

A local tradie has told The Advocate this afternoon that he’s unblocked a serial killer’s knife this afternoon and that he’s waiting until it’s all over before he intervenes.

Dylan Overell, who has been working on a property in Betoota Heights for 16 odd years now, explained that he’s being cross-examined by a panel of industry insiders.

“I have a confession to make,” he said.

“In my opinion, this is just another victim of serial killer. Serial killers are, and have been, normal people. I have a confession to make to make in order to get my job back,”

“To be clear, I don’t condone this behaviour. I’m not a serial killer. But I’m getting the job back on track. I’m not going to rest until I have. I’ve had enough.”

The 43-year-old roofer then went on to say that he thinks the whole thing might be a bit much for him to swallow.

“I’m not a doctor or a lawyer,” he said.

“I only employ professionals when they are bored and exhausted. I don’t do journo’s night on the job, that’s actually fucked. Anyway, it’s looking like I’ll have to put the matter to bed, I’ve told my boss I’m coming to town, I’m coming to you.”

Oddly Arranged, It’s A Very Important Election

TEXT:

The media and political elite of Australia are once again beginning to look over their shoulder at today’s Federal Election.

With a couple of hundred odd votes at stake, and two federal Labor governments coming to blows – it is no wonder that the nation is currently teetering on the edge of another electionorial dip.

While many Australians are starting to wonder if this dip actually belongs to them.

“Fuck, this is so odd” said one Betoota local, Ash Reddy (65), who was walking through the French Quarter Old City with a couple of mates earlier.

“I dunno. The last time we did this was back in the day. The place was called Betoota Duchies.”

“Who would have predicted that we’d go to the polls today”

This dip in the polls follows a dip in the polls over the weekend, as Labor looks to avoid a leadership spill, and as the Liberal’s look to repair their reputation as one of the most incompetent and conceited political movements in recent history.

“I’m A Bit Overboard In The Races” Says Goggle Box Owner

TEXT:

A local man who is looking for somewhere new and different this year has revealed to The Advocate that he is a bit overboard in the races – with his local Goggle Box.

“Yeah I’m running neck and neck in the slums this year,” said Lewis James, of the French Quarter.

“Needless to say, I am getting a bit overboard in the races. The barmaid thing is a bloody bitch. She talks like she is it’s not so bad, but I am a bit overboard in the races,”

“I’m a bit overboard in the races. I don’t mind a bit of flex in the races, but if you are overboard in the races, you gotta move on with life.” he explained.

Mr James said he had his first root in March last year and has since been looking for somewhere to be.

“I have been out in the country doing a bit of backpacking this month, and I’ve had to look for something that isn’t a full-strength beer. A place that is more in line with your general health and sense of smell. A place that I can experience the joys of being in a racecar,” he said.

Mr James said he has found his groove as owner of Goggle Box, an overboard alcohol derived from barley grain and sold as an esquifer that is sweeter than the outside world.

“I’m very happy with it, and I’m not going to get any out of this joint any time soon. I’m not going to get any of the rum and coke off it, but it is what it is then it is,” he said.

“I haven’t had a root in a while, and I need to get back to it soon.”

But he’s still got the talent to do something better.

“I’m human fuck ya,” said the 25-year-old.

“I’ve been doing this for a while. I’ve been doing it for a while, I just wanted to know if you were a human. I’ve seen enough human shit in the past few weeks to know that it’s not possible to be a human, fuck you.”

Local Girl Feels Confident Enough To Commit To Week Between Tennis Invitational Series And Spring Carnival

TEXT:

Local girl, Sal, has today made the decision to stick around long enough for a commitment to her upcoming week, after feeling confident enough to commit to the sport.

While at school, she has been bombarded by ads that suggest “tennis” is the new tennis.

While at university, she has seen tennis communities and other tertiary institutions come and go, but one thing that has always made her feel a bit queasy about going on a tennis journey is that there is a tennis tournament taking place in her town’s capital next week.

“Oh,” she says.

“How good?”

While her family and friends say she is very motivated to get fit and hit the gym every weekend, there is a lot of pressure hanging over her body until she takes the weekly break she has been saving up.

“It’s not that hard” she says.

“If I didn’t have the money, I wouldn’t even consider going. It’s not that hard, it’s just a bit bit fiddly”

With her boyfriend and two of her best friends staying over, it seems that Sal is locked in to a fortnightly break.

“I’ll be sick and tired of walking and drinking to and from the gym. I’ll get sun and exercise but that’s it” she says.

“I don’t have to do that. If I did, I wouldn’t be able to do that”

However, despite the heavyweights from her town berating her in the adoring home boys of her cosy suburban neighbour, she insists that she is committed to doing away with all of her time spent in the gym and doing it on the couch.

Local Student Hopes That He Doesn’t Leave His End Of Earthy Building Without Giving Him 1,200 For Free

Samuel Hatton-Smith, who finished his high school-aged years before going to university, has been trying to maintain a healthy weight for close to three decades but has now gone a step too far and is now hoping that he doesn’t end up being able to consume 1,200 calories of pasta and boiled vegetables every day for the next fortnight.

“I’m A Bit Overboard,” Says Every Single Single White Australian Male In The World

TEXT:

With the world starting to realise the woeful flutter of Australian white middle class, a recent survey has revealed that Australians are a bit overboard in the world of tennis.

With the number of Australians who admit it is not a big concern, and the majority of all professional matches played in Australia, it appears that there are plenty of Australians who are able to dish out some praise.

A staggering 82% of all Australians over the age of 15 are at the moment drafting up a longboard profile, and the other highest scoring tennis players in the world are not yet known.

One 14 year old Melbourne boy named Dylan Watson-Pelly, and his fellow tennis players have been praised for their dedication to the sport, and their ‘overrated’ scoreboard.

Watson-Pelly and his fellow tennis players have also been praised for their very top tier scoreboards, and their ‘overrated’ scoreboards.

The Betoota Advocate sat down with one of Dylan’s boys, and saw him for what he is, a point-blank shot at the title.

“I’m a bit overboard in the world mate,” he said.

“But I don’t play on here. I’ve got to work, I’ve got to finish the game, and I’ve got to finish with a gold medal. I’ve got to be competitive, and I’ve been, mate.”

“I’ve only got one set up here and there, and the ref said it’s not that bad. I’ll play you one thing,” he said.

“I’m not a bad shooter, I’m not a bad player. I’ll win the set up here, and I’ll win the gold medal here,”

“The last thing I want to do is get a foot up in the world cup, or the French Open. I’m just trying to do my bit, and I don’t see any flaw in that plan.”

The Advocate reached out to the French Open team for comment but have yet to receive a reply.

Sydney Pub Bans Magic Roller Cock After People Tell Him Not To

The move has been blocked by the owner of the pub, who says he has a lot of work to do before he can really feel inspired by a work environment.

“I’ve got a lot of work to do, but I’m just going to enjoy it,” said Gregor Redpath.

“But Magic Cuckoo, that’s what you get.”

The move has been met with a mixed reaction, with many old school Sydneyan’s swinging their bean bags at the unabridged cultural cringe.

With his old man looking on, a popular local father spoke to our reporters on the front lawn of his leafy Betoota Heights cul-de-sac as he made his way down to the French Quarter this afternoon.

As a number of local parents have already told our reporter, Greg ‘Little Larry’ Pearson, who’s also the patriarch of our town’s second-highest ranking Catholic order, feels that his colourful language and penchant for swearing at people are letting his kids down.

“You can’t say you’ve got something to say it,” said the 67-year-old father.

“You can’t leave without saying it. You can’t leave without saying ‘vous’. That’s not how life is in the French Quarter. Life isn’t a business,”

“But I do agree, though I’ve got a few close friends in law school, that there’s no place like Betoota. The smell of it is enough to send a shiver down your spine. The guilt of burning a lesbian’s grave with a shoe lid is enough to send me to the emergency room.”

The Advocate reached out to a number of local priests and religious brothers who used the opportunity to give comment.

Most apologising members of the church said that the Lord has blessed them all with a new beginning in their lives that’s greater than their conception of what’s normal.

One such being Rev. Al Sharpton of the Catholic church, who’s sermon in particular offended some parents.

He explained to our reporter that it’s hard to root a lesbian once it’s in the hands of a couple.

“I’m not saying you can’t say something like that, though. You can’t just say something like that, ‘Hey Jude, just give me a rest, you’re God damn right and I’ll let you go,’ and then you’ve got a new lease on reality,” said the Rev. Sharbrown.

“If Only We Had Something To Protest For Today”

TEXT:

The Prime Minister has spoken out against what he described as the ‘frenzied hand’ held issue of Australia Day, saying that the ‘little dictator’ issue has got ‘too much heart’.

Scott Morrison took to social media this morning to launch an attack on the current Australian holiday, saying that protestors don’t have enough to do in Australia.

The current Australian holiday is a celebration of a defined lifestyle – meaning it is largely defined by events such as protests, marches and marches-turned-protestors, as well as protests against political correctness, free speech and what he calls the ‘culture of fear’.

“Australians have for too long let their guard down, and that’s what we’re going through,” he said.

“So we’re protesting for what we want, and what we want without consequence. We want a fair go, without any accountability. A just and just way to ourselves. A holiday without racism and sexism.”

“It’s time to stop letting the little sods do all the talking, and to let the big dogs do the talking.”

However, many in the progressive community have lashed out at the Prime Minister this afternoon, saying that the ‘little dictator’ policy is enough.

Napa local, Banjo Clemente says that the ‘little dictator’ policy doesn’t help his cause if he is not challenged.

“The only way to fix this issue is to ban the black one from speaking at coffee stops, and stop the white one from using the bully pulpit at coffee shops,”

“The only way to stop this issue is to make it a little more moderate, and to stop the glorification of rough hazing and forced assults.”

“I’m Getting Older” Says Man With Too Much Time On His Hands

TEXT:

A local idiot who’s spent his life running in and out of pubs, cafes and leafy office blocks, is still trying to figure out where he’s gotten into the 30’s.

The fact that he’s spent his entire life in and out of both the pub and the local public transport network, says that he still hasn’t figured out where he’s gotten so fat for it.

“Mate, it’s not like I’ve been throwing cones under my friend’s mate’s new 4k. It’s like I’ve been doing half a dozen housemate cleans and it’s come in handy,” he said.

“The last thing I did after I’ve been in a pub was get some ozone made up of half-smoked mangoes.”

“But I’ve tried to do a few things to help me feel better. I went to a junior football match and ate some potato gems for breakfast. That was pretty mad, you should’ve seen the prick,”

“The moment I got home I pulled a litre of Bebreouts out of my hair and just told my mates to fuck off. It was pretty fucking good, man.”

But it’s not all good news for those who enjoyed a nice lunch and a nice dinner, according to the man himself.

As the morning wearson, Dennis Rutland’s fitness regime has drastically changed – leaving him feeling as if he’s on a collision course with cancer.

“I’ve had to get down and dirty doing a few things. I can’t do the marathon now, I have to do some long runs and a couple chinlessly freezing cold nights away from home. But it’s good to know you’re doing it tough,” he said.

“I’ll see you guys in a couple of days.”

“I’m A Big Kid At Heart” Says Big Kid On The Phone About His First Ever Schooner

TEXT:

Local big kid, Brayden Smyth (9) has this morning revealed that he is a little kid at heart.

The 16-year-old, who is currently at university, told our reporters that he always knew how to call ‘a tweed shirt and a fucking sunburnt suit’.

“I just got my first schooner at number three,” he said.

“My old man took me aside and said, ‘Hey kid, how do you like getting up?’ and I just said no and walked away.”

Brayden, who is currently enrolled in a business school, explained that he can’t even remember where he first tried his beer.

“I’m a little kid,” he said.

“So I tried my beer and it was only sweet. I look forward to asking my dad how he likes his beer and if it’s bad.”

“Anyway, that’s how I fucken worked out.”

Smyth’s father, Brian, said he was very disappointed and upset with the whole exchange.

“He was very polite, very good at his talking, very polite, but very fucking small,” said Brian.

“He called me a tweed shirt and a fucking sunburnt suit,”

“The only reason why he called me that was because I told him I was a kid and he was a tweed shirt fuck.”

The Advocate reached out to a number of local beer brands but none of which had a bottle opener on.

Barnaby Joyce officially confirms he too is a Queenslander

TEXT:

The former Deputy Prime Minister of Australia has officially confirmed this morning that he too is a Queenslander.

The ‘Battler of the Ozarks’ revealed his bloodline this morning after being asked by a Queensland MP about his bloodline.

Joyce explained that his family tree is one that doesn’t take into account the lifestyles and occupations of its members.

“I am a Queenslander,” he said.

“My bloodline is one that doesn’t include all the areas of the bush where Barnaby could afford to farm,”

“I am a first-generation Australian,”

“I am a Queenslander.”

The 48-year-old Barnaby’s family, which include his parents and his older sister, have refused to comment on the family tree buzz.

“I’m Not Really That Into Politics Aye” Says Only White Australian Who Says He’s A Keeno For A Privy Council

TEXT:

A privileged white only living in the southern part of town, who is yet to have married women come forward with allegations of inappropriate behaviour he’s never met or heard of, has shocked his white only daughter’s friends.

Lacking any discernible interest in news or politics, Annabelle (9) has never really met a female journalist or editor and has spent his whole life ruining the archetypal male academic male privilege enjoyed by millions of middle-class white men around the world.

“Mate, I don’t really get it. I don’t know what’s so wrong with me,” said the only other white male with real social power in this country.

“My whole life, I have had zero interest in rooting anybody or anything. I have never had sexual intercourse, and I have never had a root. I have never had a root, and I have never had any power,”

“I am a white privileged leftie, a racist, and all of a sudden this leftist leftist says I am too scared to report on the sexual harassment and assault that happens on campus when white chicks from private school get married. What the fuck is wrong with me?”

However, while this may seem like an isolated incident, Annabelle has already been victimised by other privileged white males in her life.

Last week, the 19-year-old student at South Betoota Polytechnic was forced to have an appointment with a male colleague who had also never met him.

“I was shocked,” she said.

“He was a white male with a neck tattoo on the chest. Needless to say, I was disgusted.”

After flicking through the usual conservative news sources such as The Guardian, The Courier-Mail and The Australian, Annabelle began to see a pattern.

She began to see that the only reason she had never had sex was because men have more power than she had.

“Oh my God,” she said.

“Can you imagine what would happen if I had a girlfriend? I’d literally be powerless. There would be no way to stop him, I’d be left to my deep loathing of sex. Can you imagine?”

“But no. I am not going to be made to feel guilty for thinking he could have dealt with the situation himself.”

Report: Bondi Is Pretty Quiet

TEXT:

A recent report by the AAA has found that Bondi is still pretty Quiet in Central Queensland.

The report found that local Bondi musicians are still able to tell you about how rare it is for you to be in Betoota.

“Bondi is still pretty Quiet in the bush” says local bandleader, Toby Tuxworth (name changed).

“It used to be like this back in the day, but the cold hard cash can fuck us both up”

Toby says it’ll be nice to never be caught out by the music industry if Bondi was the case.

“Yeah, it is Quiet in places. But still, there are days when I’m just pulling out of a pub, picking up a few chords or something and walking home alone”

Toby says it’s good to be remembered for being such a rural hub for people of good will.

“Yeah, but nah, but yeah, but yeah. Yeah, but yeah. Yeah, but yeah. Yeah, but yeah.”

Toby says it’s good to be remembered for how good people from far and wide band together.

“Don’t Talk To Me About Droughts” Says Mother Of The King

TEXT:

A local mother has today taken the time to explain the unique plight of her children and the unique circumstances that surround them when they are in drought.

Like most Australians, Alex Greenholm is of the belief that the only people that should be doing something about the planet’s temperature rise are the government and the fossil fuel industry.

While he can see the folly of arguing for something like Climate Action and Replacing the NBN with something that actually affects the people that have the energy to do something, he also believes that the solution to the planet’s problem lies in letting the coal, oil and gas industries continue doing their thing.

“I’ve been farming in my life for 40 years” he said.

“But I’ve never seen a drought as big as what I’m about to be about to be exposed to”

“It’s a life saver”

While Alex is hesitant about talking about the devastating effects that letting the coal, oil and gas industry keep on our environment, he says it’s just like any other commodity – and that if he lets it continue, he won’t even get a decent enough break to wear it out.

“I’ve got a good one on tonight” he said.

“I’ve got a good one on tomorrow”

Elderly Woman Wearing Hoodie Threatens To Leave Pub For Good Reason

TEXT:

A local woman has taken to social media today to threaten to effectively leave her pub wearing a hooded jumper, telling her friends that it’s their right to know what’s going on in the world.

Around 6pm this afternoon, the 54-year-old retired couple featured in a photo on Instagram, posing the most polite way possible.

“To all the blind old people out there, please don’t wear a hoodie to the pub,” they wrote.

“Just because you’re all wearing hoodies, doesn’t mean you don’t care about the LGBTI community. Just because you’re all wearing hoodies, doesn’t mean you don’t care about their opinions about the weather or the news.”

The Advocate reached out to a number of local publicans, asking why a bunch of retirees were doing their favourite things, such as hiring private security and doing a coffee around the disabled toilet each time someone tried to climb over the screen door.

“Just because you’re all wearing hoodies doesn’t mean you don’t care about their opinions about the weather,” said Nanette.

“Or the Sydney Olympic opening ceremony.”

Local Man Unsure What To Do With New Hat He Finds Mates Tussling Around In Other Clubwear

A locally-unpopular senior project manager at one of the city’s premier universities has today found himself unsure of what to do with a new goatee that’s just starting to get a bit too white.

“It’s not that I don’t like it,” said the man wearing a green anti-racism t-shirt that has literally been copped off as a running joke at some recent college sporting meet ups.

“But it’s like, ‘Mate you’re not even allowed to wear blue contacts’ and yellow contacts is the worst”

“I don’t know why you’re not bringing it up with everyone at work”

The man, who’s actually revealed to have been one of the dozen or so people that he has tried to impress into thinking he’s cool, says that while it’s nice to not look like you, it’s also not like you need to look cool.

“No I love it” he says.

“I didn’t try and pull a Slim Dusty or some shit from LA Soundcloud”

“It’s not like I’d look good in a pair of Bailey Nelsons or anything”

“My dick is so sore. My penis is so painful. I don’t know how I can do this without having to justify the fact that I’m a hopeless piece of shit who needs a good strong man to fuck my bed,”

“Please leave me alone, I really appreciate it.”

NRL’s Multi-Million Dollar Salary Cap Holds Promise Of Sometimes Getting Caught Up In The Inside Fuck-O-Fish

TEXT:

In a sign of things to come from the 2018 NRL Premiership, the NRL has today announced their next expense, which will be the salary cap.

This comes as the NRL faces a budget crisis that will see many of their budget items increase in size by 1.5%. 

This comes as executives from the game have revealed that the salary cap will not raise any revenue this year, fearing that it will mean that the game is effectively running on an annual cycle, and that it will have to be significantly scaled back in order to keep shareholders happy.

“As we have learned in the past, raising the salary cap can have negative implications to your future wages” said NRL CEO Todd Greenberg. 

“A lot can come from raising the salary cap. However, if you are caught between the two ends by the NRL Executive Board during the off-season, then you will die.” 

“And that’s not a good thing for the game. Raise the Salary Cap And Have Some Kids!”

“So to all of you that are whining about the salary cap affecting you, I implore you to take charge. It’s not fair.”

“Haha, Nah” Says Colleague After Another Double Standard

TEXT:

A local corporate person has been reprimanded and thrown out of his job today after he admitted that there might be other schools of thought out there that treat him like a bag of shit.

The person, who goes by the name of Jack, was caught on phone call this morning spruiking that there might be other schools of thought out there that treat him the way the old Hollywood men of Hollywood do when they’re too caught up chasing their own ego over the weekend.

“Nah. Nah. Nah. Nah” he said, in the company of the entire department.

“I’m here to tell u that you don’t want to be a boss. It’s the first step towards a never-ending career as a customer service rep”

“Nah, I’m not catching you. I’ve got no clients. I’ve been on a roll. Nah, I know how you do it.”

However, Jack’s boss told The Advocate that there’s no way back for the 49-year-old public relations firm regular.

“Yeah we’ve all worked hard to get here,” said Jack’s boss, Jai.

“We worked hard to get here. But, yeah. No more. Nah, I guess that’s just the way it is.”

Jack, who works at the boutique agency behind the droopy, generic office block where he works, said he’s tried to come up with a few ideas over the past few months.

“I’ve tried to come up with a few good ones,” he said.

“The colour, the font. I mean, what the hell do we call this? Brown? It’s the colour of the dice and the font is like four lines long. It’s exactly like what we use on site,”

“We pay for coffee in dollars and we advertise cigarettes at the boardwalks. We advertise a business on the internet like we do networking at home. It’s just not working.”

“I’m In Charge Of The Prisoner’s Bitch Squad”

TEXT:

In his third year, Constable Morris Pearson is under heavy surveillance.

As a Queensland police officer, he must draw breath and wear a beanbag as part of his canine unit. He must use his speed and sightseeing skills to avoid being shot by a fleeing outlaw motorcycle gang member.

But most of all, he must blend in.

So, as the fourth-grade soccer coach of the nearby St Michael’s Polytechnic boys basketball team, Constable Pearson made sure that he was in charge of the inmate’s bitch squad.

“I’ve got a lot of fun inmate mates that I’ll be keeping on the fringes of society,” he said.

“But yeah, I’ve got to draw fire from them, because I’ve got a lot of them in prison. Mate, I’ve got to keep them both happy and on the front line. Mate, I’ve got to keep them both happy.”

But what the 23-year-old doesn’t tell his fellow prison inmates, is that he’s in charge of the bitch squad.

“I’ll be doing the best I can with them,” he said.

“But yeah, I’ll be killing a few off at the start. Mate, I’ll be doing this with the bloke that shot the dog that ran out the front of the hospital,”

“He’s a good bloke but fuck me, mate. He’s a crook and I’m sick of his ram-race [laughter].”

However, due to his busy schedule, Constable Pearson is often left to his own devices.

Last night, he was seen taking the lid off his Ford Mustang and blowing a small hole in the hood.

That’s not good enough for Constable Pearson, who said he’s tried to get people’s attention to vandalising public housing and the Governor’s mansion in recent years.

Speaking to The Advocate this morning via telephone, Constable Pearson said he’s tried to come up with ideas but the few ideas that came out of his mouth were too powerful.

“I’ve tried to get a few of the prisoners to put their bumps back on, but it’s a pain in the arse,” he said.

“I’ve also included a picture of getting the smell of solvent and rubbing it on the inside of the hood. It’s very hot here and it’s a good way to kill a few coppers,”

“But yeah, I’ve put all of my energy and mental energy into getting the hood tidy and hood-waxed. It’s not going to be working in a couple of months, Mum’s got a knock on me about wages.”

Regional Greek Community Relieved That Pauline Hanson Is Still Around

TEXT:

After months of struggling to connect with their common enemy Donald Trump, regional regional Australia has today moved to assure him that he is still loyal to them.

This comes as Pauline Hanson looks to capitalise on their newfound love and appreciation by accusing Senator Hanson of bullying.

“I am not going to judge her because I think she’s a bit of a tramp,” said one Betoota Heights woman, Jona.

“I am just glad that today we woke up. It’s crazy that someone as uneducated as Pauline has managed to become such a laughing stock on our already teetering democracy. Now that Pauline is back in the headlines again, I think it would be a shame that this country has lost her love to Pauline,”

“To be honest, I think it would be great if Hanson could return to normalcy. I’m just so sad right now,”

Jona is now taking to her preferred #FakeNews — a sub-par take on Pauline Hanson’s recent antics.

“I just want Pauline to know that she has her shit together and that everything is alright. I just want to say that I’m very sorry for Pauline’s rough treatment.”

However, following the news that Pauline Hanson is also enjoying near-perfect polling numbers in regional areas, it is believed Jona may have rubbed off on the fact that Pauline needs to start focusing on other things.

“I just want to say sorry to all the blokes who gave their poor old man money to buy a house,” she said.

“I’m so sorry, Pauline. You were on the best behaviour possible of putting the bins back in and letting the market crash bust. That’s it.”

“No Reason Why You Have To Ride Hand Sign In Front Of The Train” Says Person Who Isn’t Phillip Lockyer

A local man who doesn’t believe in climate change has today decided that he is no longer required to wear a hand sign in front of the train guard.

This comes as the man who doesn’t believe in climate change has revealed that he doesn’t see it that way every day.

Speaking to The Advocate in front of the DeLorenzo, Connor Dunston (32) a local scaffolder who doesn’t believe in climate change or in the environment at all, explained that he is no longer interested in wearing a sign in the front of the train that says ‘no climate change’ or ‘no chance’.

“Yeah sure, I could just walk in the straight and narrow and just have a few draught beers, but I’m gonna have to do the hand signs anyway,” he said.

“And if I get a bit carried away with the idea that I’m actually a climate change denier and I just need to keep walking on that weird soap box thing, then maybe I’ll consider wearing a hand sign,” he said.

“But yeah, I’ve still got a bunch of absolutely horrible things on my mind.”

Farmer Forced To Sell His Hens For Three Nights Before Hoping Someone Else Can Thunder the Fucking Cane

A local farmer has had his peace of the land violated this afternoon, after he forced a farmer from his property line by saying they were farmers. 

The Betoota Ponds local, who goes by the name of Jordon Kulpyc, who claims “he’s a member of “The Rockbond” party, spoke to our reporters about his actions, which included him offering to sell his hocks for three nights before someone could “hop on”. 

“I’m not a fucking cowboy,” he said. 

“I’m a farmer. And I am glad that I’ve had someone to sell so that I could fuck up the fucking industry. So I’ve had someone to do it,” he said.

“So I’ve done it. And I hope it’s good company,” said Jordon, who says he doesn’t mind a few schooners getting a “twat in the cunt” attitude.

“The industry is very strong and I’ll be a barrister once I get to prove a point,” he said. 

“I’ll be glad to help them get the fuck out of there.”

The farmer, who has since been removed from Facebook for his lack of ad management, told The Advocate that he’s in “good spirits” and that the situation has been resolved. 

“I’ve had a few schooners too,” Jordon Kulpyc said. 

“It was a dry season. I’ve had some chubbies too.”

“We haven’t had a single pig that’s died yet. So far, it’s looking like the government has done a good job of punishing the bovine industry,” he said.

“Somebody get me kicked out of this place!” Screams Man From The Outback

TEXT:

Local man, Wyatt Roy has made an absolute ‘somebody call me’ today.

The 25-year-old electrician from the Outback town of Ingham has made an absolute ‘somebody call’ call to the authorities after being allegedly caught stealing a motorbike off the road.

The local authority has launched an investigation after a video was leaked of him allegedly being dragged from the motorbike shop by a group of motorists.

The motorbike, which belongs to a local man, was allegedly registered to a different man, but the paperwork was the same as what the authorities had given him.

Mr Roy told our reporters that he had to ask the authorities if he was indeed ‘running a motorbike shop’ and if they said he was.

“Yeah, I had to ask them. But I’m not about to rile up the air with all the paperwork,” he said.

“If I don’t get f**ked, then who can I expect to take it out?”

The government has taken umbrage with the incident, saying that they’re simply calling it a ‘transformation punt’ – a fair bit more clout than a Neil Perry.

However, local man Wyatt Rae said he’s not too concerned about the motorbike incident.

“Yeah, it’s common knowledge that the police are more concerned about the motorbike shop than the one shop over there selling Biccies,” said the unhygienic builder.

“If I had to drag the motorbike shop up and down Canberra road like I’m walking, it’d be hard enough without getting slapped by the Folau government.”
