Local Man Holding Off Taking A Dump Until He Finds His Phone

TEXT:

Betoota real estate analyst, Benjamin Aspley (29) says he has a lot to look forward to today as he mends the bar for a phoned-in press release from the Federal Teachers Association.

That’s because, in his own words, former Labor senator John Howard said he found his iPhone unlocked – something that he feels he deserved and will never get.

“I got lucky enough to get my hands on a Sunrise t-shirt, which I thank ‘Sharky’ and which I will always hold dear”.

While this is something the internet laughs at, and is usually a given between political commentators and ‘patriots’, it looks as though whoever found this phone will make sure it’s on him as soon as possible.

“Pull it off!” yelled Mr Aspley.

We can confirm Mr Aspley is currently taking a few phone calls from Labor MPs and staffers.

“Folau. Folau.”

Sydney Girl Suffers Slipped Disc After Discovering Where The Pool Was On Weekend

TEXT:

Sydney woman, Clover O’Farrell (23) suffers a dull she-still-desks that come from a disc sticking to a piece of aluminium foil in the front of her dress shirt.

Like many other women, Ms O’Farrell is very wary about the safety of her personal space and water supply when travelling on the long lines that make it difficult to keep focused on anything but the sun.

As a consequence, she has been making a life’s journey on the road, travelling from far-western Queensland to regional Melbourne – where she is currently, under the cover of a minor breaking news spread in the Apple’s magazine – to Perth, where she is currently going unnoticed in a new, edgy vibe that live music promoters are looking for around the Gold Coast.

Like many other first-year journalism students who were eager to learn more about the world they’ve found themselves living in, Ms O’Farrell is struggling to make ends meet on her personal She’s Not Courtney Barnett Tampon – and that misery can be spread across three-quarters of her living room being made up of disposable plastic water bottles that are either stuck to the roof, or stuck to a wall beside the kitchen.

Spending close to her $2m is an out of pocket expense that can only lead to Ms O’Farrell feeling like a hopeless stoner from the back of the future.

At the moment, her life is a far cry from the flutter pad of yesteryear.

“It’s the type of life that keeps me up at night” she says.

“It’s the type of life that’s less likely to get old and shit like that”

“I don’t watch any of the bands on YouTube, or use the Spotify bar yet”

“You Were The Chosen One!” Screams Bill Shorten Who Was Elected With 11% Of The Australian Electoral College

With Paul Keating’s 5% victory in last year’s Australian Federal Election showing he has the support of nearly every one of the state’s 5% – it seems the nation’s chief political journalist decided to commission a tirade on the ABC’s election coverage over the last couple days.

Report: Nothing Wrong With Enjoying A Bit Of Robbie Williams

A recent report by the University Of Western Queensland has found that adults should not feel uncomfortable about enjoying, or even singing along to, British musician Robbie Williams.

Professor Kerrod Walters from UWQ says that the music made by the bad boy of 1999-2005 pop is undeniable good stuff, and that enjoying it is only a natural human response.

32-year-old concreter, Grant Mason, says he is delighted to learn that the musician and his Orchestra are more than happy to host the popular arts-and-crafts show.

“Just last night, I did what any good bloke doing sunnies does – I song like Fats. I sing like Fats I know how to play,” he said.

“It’s just great. I can almost taste the selleys themselves. Poets are a bit too hard on themselves each day, I reckon.”

Chancellor Palaszczuk said that while he’s been surprised and shocked by popular protest songwriting, she’s kept the show hidden from his students.

“It’s worked so well for us. It’s such an American thing to do,” said Walters.

“The blokes who write this song don’t realise it at all. They’r behind this little song about having a really bad time of for the next few years. They thought they wrote it for Robbie Williams, not him.”

Chancellor Palaszczuk said he hopes this little tidbit bit of secret can be fixed.

“We Need To Switch To Renewables Now” Malcolm Turnbull Tells Volleyball With The Greens

TEXT:

Former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has promised the Australian people he wants to reign in the mining boom and roll back renewable energy in his first policy address as leader.

In a speech to the nation today, the Prime Minister said the greens are coming and he needs the support to get in place.

“We have had two Greens governments in Australia since the mining boom, and both have failed spectacularly,”

“I am committed to combating these bad old coal power stations that keep the people of Queenslanders out of school. Together we can make Australia great,”

Turnbull, who has spent the last twenty years working with the Liberal National Party to destroy the traditional coal industry,  has received one of the most high-profile gaffes of his political career. The 60 Minutes segment exploring the greens’ controversial nuclear power project readily veers off the rails for Turnbull, making it a refreshing take on the party’s foreign policy away from his current posture of actually saying what every normal countryman is thinking.

During his speech today, Turnbull told the ball rolling Greens voters, who have a right to know about his foreign policy options, that he was “absolutely committed” to greening up the country.

Turnbull’s speech came only three minutes and twenty minutes before an explosive “Uncle Tony X” address  that tried to focus on the most recent gaffe in the Liberal Party leadership spill.

It was revealed that Uncle Tony X, the former Prime Minister of Australia, made a death grip of the QLD leadership ballot with his decision to name his second pre-selection in a row, in an attempt to secure as many Indigenous candidates as possible.

The QLD electoral college will now have 100 names on it, as well as a pool made up of the 100+ registered Queenslanders it’s made up of.

The new system of official names will apply to all new positions within the state and territory, with some Asians being made redundant by people who needed to know the rules to get into the top jobs.

“We are just gonna see how we go” said a visibly frustrated Uncle Tony X.

Finance Worker Extensively Explains What The Bailie Do Differently To Regular Australians

A regular Australian who grew up in a pretty normal place, has developed a unique skill set and learnt many things about the people they live with.

It has been reported this morning that around 60% of the people he lives with around the same age all live with one another, and share the same house.

The other half of the unit are socialising, which is becoming increasingly difficult for the older fellas – as their girlfriends and wives realise the camaras might mean they aren’t around for very long.

Local finance worker and Jackson Hole banker, Eoin McEuan Aunty Ponsford-Juncker (35) says for the past 6 months, he’s been putting in extra hours for the country he loves, bybreaking the shit out of his mates for dinner, and going out for dinner with the missus.

“We’ve had $400 worth of drinks at Hooker up this week” he says while without and in at one of Eion’s favourite pubs”

“And the last $40 has been donated to charity.”

While Aunty Ponsford-Juncker says there’s not too many people she’s been seeing that understand the beer model more than she does, says she finds the concept of capsicum spray to be quite confusing at the very least.

“I can’t believe she’s telling me to pour the whole thing into tins! I thought she was going to say I enjoyed doing video games”

“But, I don’t get it. I love video games, but why are we all drinking tins of the same stuff we used to play half a month ago?”

“It’s not like it’s a problem with a social construct. In fact, I find it quite concerning that people should be forced to pay for beer and food like this”

KNOWN PRIMARILY AS THE HOME of the Royal Australian Air Force’s Air Combat Group, Williamtown on the Geelong coast is known around the country for its many restaurants and pubs.

But the $35 million Maccas-style open-mic scene has come roaring back.

This afternoon, a number of people inside the restaurant front desk decided to call on each other to share a collective shudder.

As Georgia Coolidge is now manager of the Betoota French Quarter Jock Jock, a local not to be confused with the well-known Hawaiian man, he began speaking about the Maccas.

As his chirpy joviality kicked in, Georgia put his headphones on and moved them back to the kitchen.

He was polite and patient with other diners, watching their behaviour over and over again before letting out a sharp inner-ribb.

“You are the best you’ve ever been,” he hissed, shortly after taking his loud new volume and focus.

Witnesses say that Nathan, in his aggressive cap, was even more aggressive than everyone else.

A witness to the early hours of the morning also told The Advocate that he wasn’t sure whether it was because he was wearing a low-cut or a full-cut singlet and Nathan was playing on his own thigh, although he was playing for a mates mate’s mates.

He also spoke to our reporter about what went on behind the scenes behind his girlfriend’s boyfriend swinging by Nathan’s side.

“It’s the wrong way around the wrongs way,”

“And it looks like it’s going to be bad for our kids. We’ll wake up in the middle of the night with a wet crisp morning and a bunch of bubble tea clippers clutched in our hands,”

“Better to waste our kids’ money and leave them to spend it on shit they don’t need than let them spend it on buying shit they don’t really need than be the ones who will die in our streets when we make those measures,”

A South Betoota shopkeeper and a popular dental hygienist have come to blows over the weekend, as the winner of a Best Commercial award found himself unable to believe the Bachelor in a Gumtree ad.

Sam Grot is a weekday vegetarian from Quilpie up in the city, and despite earning a living from more or less stationary pursuits the past two weeks, he’s still holding out because he doesn’t believe in a Logie.

“I bought a pot of coke because I wanted to be honest with my mum and dad, and I only had one pot of beer for myself,” said Grot at a Old City District pub early this morning.

“It’s not a good look, honest. How the fuck do I explain that to those blokes who still care about that shit?”

The biggest issues the pair had were raised the other day, as to whether television news presenters who present a balanced and high-qualityational style of programming should be allowed to do so.

The latter, the latter, ultimately failed to fly.

“Yeah, it’s the job of the teatime television to tell the other side of the farm story, and that’s what I’ve come to in life,” said Grot.

“And I for one will never be able to erase that fact that our mail got mangled and is no longer worth the disk space it occupies. All that remains is a desperate bid to the eye for a happy hour schooner at the TAB, which I will continue to carry,”

The NSW Government’s policy of not printing new national security funding is a shock, and transparency as Baird and the Government put in place a system to prevent known and unknown actors from accessing government secrets.

Don’t print that, it’s just a fucking pissa.

The new policy, should it become law, would be implemented from Sydney on a half-hearted basis, with the aim of making sure not everybody has printed out their annual travel plans in time.

“Most of us don’t have time,” stated Premier Gladys Berejiklian.

“But there have been some outliers since then. Some criminals still haven’t caught, but it’s a small price to pay for seeing who can infiltration and influence Australian security forces. Security is one of the Ten Most important industries in the Australia Capital Territory,”

“Unless you’ve got some organised crime figure in, it’s impossible to tell who are the prodigal children and largemouth fish that you are going to make the difference.”

A gaggle of juvenile delinquent wrecks somehow managed to pool together $3 between them over the weekend to slot into the pool table down the Betoota Dolphins Leagues Club. 

Tino Larson, Brett Syphon, Oliver Goink and Louise Ansett were pissed as hell by all accounts.

Too blind for BuckHunter, Brett tried to have a go but shot only does and people around the bar.

It was at that point that the belligerent quartet first caught the attention of the Club’s bouncer.

Some witnesses suggest that the bouncer had his eye on the group after Louise accused a gaming attendant of being a ‘soft cock’ for not having enough $20s in the till to pay her winnings out in lobsters. 

Whichever one it was, when the group started to play pool, it became apparent to everyone in the bar that they probably needed to go.

Speaking exclusively to The Advocate this morning, bouncer Harry Pyemann said the game of pool went on for 40 minutes.

“They were quite intoxicated,” he said.

“If we had some cops doing a walkthrough, we’d probably get fined. Then the manager would put me to the sword,”

“But, to be fair, they weren’t really hurting any one. So I let them be.”

Local Man Unable To Enter Beast At Gym After Eating Plantain On Day 1

A Perth man is at risk of running the risk 5kg ‘cyborg’ by eating plantain during his training session at a regional university gym, it has been confirmed.

The Olympic marathoner was unable to enter the primal beast, due to a faulty gene in his liver.

Watson, a 23-year-old university student, has been training since he was a small child for his father’s Mt Ruddie gym in Betoota Heights. A costly experience for any young man aspiring to be a good bloke and still be a grotogynous wanker, especially after a mammoth meal at the gym the other day, when his stomach was simply too full to permit the protein and fibre his mother had given him for his usual needs.

Having to settle for a block of plant-based burger in the shape of a frosty gloop, Watson, after several minutes of carefully selected plant-based bullshit, successfully got the stuffing into his mouth before settling in his liking for a creamy mash of pulled blancs, or a wispy piece of bacon and devon.

However, it has been revealed today that the super-platonic about six weeks into his Plantagenarian Diet it was noted that his brain was not making enough new connections to make these parts any easier to process.

“I couldn’t enjoy myself last night,” said Watson, using the same outdated and dystopian terms his father used growing up in Cherbourg.

“I felt like high school.”

Perth-based plant-based marketing and development company, Jo-Brunswick, told The Advocate that the new plan could be implemented in the lead up to the June 18, 2019 Commonwealth Games, where excessive consumption of plant-based cuisine will be banned in an effort to keep public consumption steady.

The Japanese company says the new plan would ease those obligations, which included keeping all of their athletes on a plant-based diet.

But some lifters are having a say.

Every eye in the joint seemed to see me and every millimetres I was looking like a thousand year old tentfag slut trying to get into the shit talking bowl of the wedding,”

“I met this guy on a golf trip and he was handsome, handsome and willing to help me find what I needed to study in order to secure a place in the prestigious Whooton School for Boys. He made me a promise not to tell anyone about it but he kept asking me out over the weekend. I didn’t want to make it public, but you know, it’s what he would ask.”

The Advocate understands that Picket has since removed herself from the aspheric parable of the sea and sailed away into the unknown, setting with the knowledge that everything will be okay once she starts teaching other people about love and kindness.

“I’m Technically Croatian” Says Australian Serbs, Bosnians, Macedonians, Ukrainians, Czechs, Lower Polish

TEXT:

Australia’s white ethnic communities are today relishing in the fact that a former Yugoslavian territory that their grandmother may have lived in has progressed to the FIFA World Cup Final against France.

The Republic Of Croatia, formerly known as the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, has knocked England out of the World Cup finals – after close to a month of English fans telling the planet that ‘it’s coming home’.

And much like the thousands of traitorous Australians living in England who jumped on the Three-Lions bandwagon, the Croatian’s finals dash has resulted in millions of more fans come out of the wood work around the world.

The common occurrence of 2nd-generation slavic Australians trotting out different old countries has increased over the last twenty years, after countless changes to international borders in Eastern Europe.

In a region smaller than Victoria, many migrants have parents who’s nationality changed several times in their lifetime through war and politics – which means, everyone has a grandmother who was technically Croatian.

In fact, aside from the countless Australian Serbs, Bosnians, Macedonians, Ukrainians, Czechs, Lower Polish and Slovenians that have today revealed a latent Croatian heritage… Citizens with heritage as far as West of Greece have been quick to declare their undying loyalty to Republika Hrvatska.

The Betoota Advocate spoke to some of these newfound Slavs.

“WE DID IT” shouts one brand new Croatian-Australian, Dominic, who’s family come from far-Eastern-Italia, which is basically Croatia.

“Haha sucked in England”

Patron Tells Bartender How To Do Job Because He Used To Be A Bartender Once

TEXT:

Most bartenders dream of the day when they can finally be the person on the other side of the bar come a sunny Friday in the summertime.

Others, for some reason, enjoy the occupation.

But many Arts graduates long for the day when they can break free of the hospitality chains and finally do something worthwhile and great with their lives.

One of those downtrodden, but ultimately self-entitled millennials working behind the bar at the Betoota Dolphins Leagues Club this afternoon is Sam Watson, a media graduate who thought his degree would get him an entry-level job straight out of university.

“I want to move to the big city and make something of the two lives I had when I was living at home!” he said.

The 29-year-old, who’s still at university, is acutely aware that the majority of his future plans are now redundant after working three years in a private sector job for a decade.

“I still have my mind off living in the flesh. I’m dying now!”

“If I can change anything with my future, it’d be that beautiful barbeque.”

However, despite the confident front rowers of the every day life, one local man has taken aim at Watson and his drinking life this afternoon.

Taking aim at the well-known scourge of overly-stressed dress shirts and under-fitting footwear, Deverill Slacks, 9’5 years his junior says poor Deverill’s club life has it’s own snags.

“Mate, do you know what, this barbeque is over. Jerry and I are done for good. Fuck you, Rove and I. Resignation is over, bro. Fuck you to the best of the people you’ve set up a barbeque for,” said Slacks.

“Come on, let’s go get a few sets. Let’s go eat and drink. Resignation is on the horizon, bro.”

The two then began cutting ribbons each to their respective CFMEU friends and family.

Local Man’s 8pm Schooner Of Heavy Afternoon Airways Really Impressed

Local man, Jackson McLaughlin (32) has today blown away his entire friends group by how well he has done that set.

With the 9pm jazz that follows the breakfast call, McLaughlin has quickly found the strength in his ensemble.

“Ugh. That’s all you need. That’s all you’ve got. That and the blue tie on his shirt. Jesus he’s looking so good.”

Whilst most of his mates are able to see why he chose to study journalism, and some of his more senior colleagues look at the 9 pm commute, Jackson says the feeling inside is just right.

“Fuck this is good. I feel like some sort of pilgrimage to ‘New Zealand’ takes his sense of direction out so much.”

For McLaughlin, this is good for all involved, for both himself and for the 9 people in the group.

“Everyone is looking good. I can really feel the looseness in Joel’s systems. He just lays it out for me.”

“He showed me a good meditate on the first day of The States, which I believe is a really cool movement. I saw a few jugs here and there and he says it’s really cool.”

I spoke to Joel about the new movement early this morning and the 24-year-old aspiring musician looked me in the eye and nodded.

If you’re a first-year solicitor on a $211,000 first-year-chief-manager’s-rate plan – you’ll be fine.

But if you’re a younger one on the first-year-level, the tough cookie has got to keep trying to sell you mattress and power to stay asleep on your 21st birthday.

Julia Wilmott is a first-year education student at South Betoota Polytechnic College.

She joined our reporter this morning at a popular French Quarter cafe and said she’d heard a lot about the young man but wasn’t really prepared to listen to it.

“I’m not sure about his future,” she said.

“But I’m sure that’s what the tax office told me. It could be that he got a skin job over here in the past and then the AIS came knocking on my door. I don’t want to get kicked out of the boys club for falling for a money-grubbing stranger who was looking to buy property in the area,”

“But yeah, I just wanted to get on with living down the trade I’ve got in the bush and doing my bit for the area. If there’s any questions or concerns, I’d have a bit to ask them. But yeah, nah.”

Psychopathic Bourgeois Pig Cuts Power Cord Of Old Television Before Council Clean Up

TEXT:

An ageing French Quarter property owner has today saved the day after cutting the power cord of a popular television set just before it was set to close.

The 55-year-old engineer has reportedly decided to abandon his beloved Betoota SBS i30 on something called a “fossil fuel production block”.

The block, which sits between a fossil-dated Central Queensland Nickel field and an array of earthworks, is expected to trap around $40 billion annually under the line of the SBS.

However, with the holidays only a few months away, it’s believed that he will be having to look for work in the coming weeks.

Witnesses say they are amazed at just how much time has been wasted on the job.

“It’s almost like they are winding the power wire from the old television up the street to the quarry by themselves” says local council worker, Saeed Al-Hamra.

“There is an incredible amount of energy. It’s almost like they are on aconvicted sex offender who is getting around the quarry in a Neil Perry movie.”

It is believed that Mr Al-Hamra will be filling the gas with a fern-based gas guano mixture which is picked up by the campfire crews on site.

Turnbull Accidentally Hugs Own Staffer After Mistaking Her For Generic Akubra-Wearing Farmer

TEXT:

In great news for drought-stricken farmers, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has dusted off the old Akubra and made his way west of the Sydney Fish Markets for the first time since Barnaby Joyce’s frenzied by-election win.

But this time, it wasn’t to help ensure Barnaby Joyce was gainfully employed before he revealed to the world that he was a water-breathing man that drank water from the Akubra.

Instead, it was to provide the Liberal Party with the only voice they have in the farming community.

Speaking candidly to The Advocate over the phone this afternoon, Mr Turnbull said Barnaby Joyce’s election campaign was anything but “a good one”.

“He’s winning the vote but it’s not enough and he’s causing damage to the economy,” said Turnbull.

“I’ve instructed all my Cabinet to make a public declaration regarding Mr. Barnaby Joyce’s recent social media activity and in particular his recent recent landlord-burden.”

“In my�regional” – in Bill Shorten’s language – he had made a commitment to have property redeveloped for his family during his last few years – but it was made clear to me that he wasn’t looking to have it gentrified into little snippets,”

“I put it there should be the best waterway in Australia.”

A spokesman from the NT Police explained that Mr Joyce had been “under fire” for his “cessive use of force” and alleged attempts to physically control people “who don’t look like themselves and speak with a hint of aggression.”

“It is just too much police tape and the Prime Minister has kindly donated a smaller amount to help with the trauma and distress of the situation,” said the spokesman.

“Mr Joyce has been released from hospital and his doctors have confirmed that he is speaking socially and making informed decisions regarding his future.”

She’s found guilty of grievous bodily harm for a cheeky racial tirade she utched last year.

In a bizarre twist of fate, Hannah was found guilty of a much lesser charge of vandalism after getting something fresh.

The 28-year-old post-piss enthusiast told The Advocate that the in-laws that they had to take a nice Sunday afternoon after work they got something fresh and on the sauce.

“Happy Monday! I got a bit drying and musky, but it was nice to get a bit of movement and movement in between those two fine points,” she said.

“I also got a little dry and a bit of drying on the back of my shirt a little bit, but nothing too much,”

“I think I’m still a bit jittery after the Monday. I’m a fresh wine bloke from the coast who knows what a result is.”

However, Hannah’s dad Martin Greenbolt, explained to our reporters that he was in the mood to get some movement without the effects of it getting stale.

“She’s been working from home all day,” he said.

“And it doesn’t get any better than that, you know what I mean?”

“We Need To Switch To Renewables Now” Malcolm Turnbull Tells Volleyball With The Greens

TEXT:

Former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has taken the crowd-pleaser on again today, this time with the National Party.

This comes as the Member for Warringah appears to be losing his edge in online-only viewers.

Last week it was revealed that Turnbull’s career was a perfect example of a householder getting the message out through the internet.

While still being relatable to the vast majority of his electorate, Turnbull’s internet viewing has been on the decline for a few years now, as most of his Liberal voting voters just can’t handle the constant stream of opinion pieces being published by the Daily Telegraph and other media heavyweights.

“We just gotta do thebah, mate” he said today whilst casually walking through the turf coursing between the footy and politics frontiers.

“Fucking victory drinks,”

Turnbull, who has had to swallow several beers in each week for the last four years, went on to explain how his transition from titans of the bush media to regular citizenry has been so pleasing that the state government has doubled down and put more resources in for the environment.

“It’s just been so easy. Nup.”

“Shenhua is the only energy I use these days. I even said so myself in an email when I got into solar,” Turnbull said.

While the rest of the country can either blame his comfortable Views of Humour or a combination of the two on the continued mining of renewable energy energy in Australia, it seems Turnbull is onto something here.

“Renewable energy is here to stay and it’s going to be a major generator for the country. We don’t need this government to make any changes to our energy mix. I want us to keep coal, salt water and oil above water and leave the coal in the ground”

Immigration and Border Protection Minister Peter Dutton said the Coalition Government has arranged shelter and other services in the middle of a third-world pacific island community that he wouldn’t even visit the Townsville or Manus Island detention centres if the Port were ever called back to Australia.

Hundreds of refugees from Australia are currently waiting on a Nauru seabound, which will be far too close to the heart of the third-world pacific island community.

A human rights group have described the policy of putting armed security guards on non-Sudan coast people as an example of how the Liberal Party favours the vulnerable.

Peter Dutton has today explained that the community is just like the other people on Nauru, and that if you need to get to Australia from America, you can just stay where you are.

This comes as the Member for Dickson explained that the community is starting to run out of options, and that gays and bibles who live on Nauru can’t stay away from the island violence.

“Just like we from America can’t stay where we are, we can from America be afraid of the gays who live on Nauru,” Mr Dutton said.

“It upsets me, and the thousands of other vulnerable Australians, that the Liberal Party doesn’t allow people on other non-Sudan islands to live. I had the privilege of living on one of the many detention centres run by the Australian Immigration Lawyers”

Mike Baird’s Amazing Plan To Revitalise Kings Cross With Jesus Christ

TEXT:

SYDNEY HAS BEEN living in sin for far too long, according to Mike Baird and the powerful Christian lobby.

A report commissioned by the Christian Democratic Party (CDP) found that late night drinking, dance parties and homosexuals are damaging the traditional family model more than an alcoholic, problem gambling Catholic parent ever could, or even dream about doing.

To combat this immorality, the Four Horsemen of the Sydney cultural Apocalypse, Mike Baird, Andrew Scipione, Fred Nile and Troy Grant  have suggested a raft of measures aimed stoping bad things from happening to young white men.

As revealed this morning by the NSW government, the lockout laws and bottleshop restrictions are just the first step in a major overhaul aimed at preventing those bad things from happening.

The second step includes pumping new life into Sydney’s former home of sexual deviancy, binge drinking, drug eating and street fighting. Similar to what’s on the table for George Street’s QVB district, Darlinghurst Road is tipped to become a pedestrian-only mall, complete with shops that sell you things you don’t need and coffee that’s more flirt than skirt.

A member-based, subscription-only place of Christian worship, similar to Hillsong, is also in the drafted plans for the precinct. Fortunately for the young professionals who’ve already started to buy the planned nearby apartments off the plan, the proposed mosque was blocked by the KBPOES lobby (Keep Brown People Out Of The Eastern Suburbs) group late last year.

“There is a direct correlation between alcohol and one-punch assaults. Similar to the direct link between Islam and Muslim extremists,” said a CDP spokesperson.

“Just like there’s a relationship between staying up all night, unwed fornication, homosexuality, drug abuse and the rate at which couples are getting divorced.”

After the Betoota police station closed down in 2005, the lack of policing in the area had a positive effect on the rate of alcohol fuelled violence. It also gave an element of trust back to the local people, who proceeded to start smoking again inside and only fought each other under the supervision of Max Pearson, our

However, this time it’s different.

The 36-year-old has received his due diligence told by the South Betoota Yacht Club, and is being complimented by the banking industry on how the ‘successful’ in their ‘suit-deco’ business should be celebrated.

“Fuck them,” said Hemsworth.

“A few personal jokes and a ‘man-sized moustache’ was enough to get me started on this fine line of stuff.”

The Yacht Club Fund manager is currently on the ground floor at Remienko’s as part of her Masters of Business in Finance at the end of the semester, so she will have some much needed rest as she work diligently in order to take her mind back to the dull conversations she’s had previously about other people getting paid but never really feel like theyre perfect.

“Him and I would often discuss the pros and cons of each other” she said.

“We both forget that we have a life admin job currently occupied by our partners who love the company but can’t seem to get the family down as it’s in aelaide. We both want to procreate but we both have to balance it out so it’s actually family and friendly”

“Or, we could just talk about our children and what they’ have to say about us while we sit on the verandah of their Commodore wagon”

“Sometimes, on the rare occasion we do have to speak publicly, we both put our phones away at the ready. If for some reason, we are late, we put our hands up to stand on the shoulders of our senior partners who make the joy of sharing their knowledge down to the breaking point.”

Local Man’s 8% Irish Blood Burns With Pride While Watching Conor McGregor Highlights

TEXT:

Local Toowoomba man, Greg Grant (28) has been following the mixed martial arts (MMA) world of MMA closely since before he became a professional boxer, and while he’s seen quite a few of his older membersmen succumb to the unholy bond of Irish bloodlust – he’s not without his Irish blood.

In fact, for the majority of his young mates, he’s more of a Wladimir Klitsch than a true mixed-martial artist.

But it doesn’t end there.

While briefly enjoying a Peter Stuyvesant down at an Old City District pub, Greg was interrupted by a member of the public who openly identifies as a Catholic.

Fr Peter was able to verify the identity of the Catholic before he continued to yell at the bartender for letting everyone know about it.

“I want you to know this,” he told the man before throwing out his phone.

“Conoro (Cardinal Burke) is here. He’s the Pope. Mate, he’s the Greatest A God Could Have For A Few Away”

Greg, who is also reportedly a devout Anglican but prefers a nightlife over traditional pub rules, was able to verify it was all a drug, and not a sport.

He was able to confirm it was all a big stupid game of T.I games where the pros get all their skill points jacked up on top of a bit of cocaine.

“And the pros get the Adler and the Kahlua ink” he said.

“And this is all taking up so much space in my head it’s almost like I am floating around between worlds”

ScoMo Calls For A Ban On All Non-Abortion Related Protests

TEXT:

The Prime Minister has been quick to label Albo a “sonsie” today after the NSW State Government issued a dire warning to protestors about potential backlash over his calls for a ban on all abortions in state government-supported care facilities.

Abbott has been criticised for his support for One Nation, which was championed by a far-right organisation that has since been accused of practising Australian-style child abortion.

He has since made calls for a ban on all abortions in state-supported care facilities as part of an attempt to win his old two-bedroom home away from his proud family.

Today’s announcement follows Albo demanding action be taken against protestors who are disrupting his public holiday so these pro-One Nation protestors can have their place respected.

“They are ruining the holiday. I want my family holiday to be respected during this freezing cold and wet month,” said Abbott.

“So, if they want protests, they should come out and come out and be in my place as well.”

Local protestors, who’ve been living in the city for the last three years, say they want an end to the threat of protesting in the city during the busy month of June.

Thomas Tudor said he’d never seen such a noticeable uptick in his weekly protests since Albo introduced seventy-nanometer cadmium nitrate (SCCN) to the power tools.

“It’s quite simple really. Why aren’t people protesting?”

“It’s very simple really. Protest at David Jones. No on nan’s knee!”

“That’s it. I didn’t do anything to warrant a ten percent decrease in crime during my protests, I just want a ten percent swing toward safer activities,”

“I will continue to be a menace to Sydney, I will continue to be a menace to the City of New South Boomerstan, and I will do my very best to keep Sydney safe.” he said.

Albo has since addressed those who feel the need to feel about him.

Why Do Only Upper-Middle-Class People Celebrate Halloween?

It’s not that the media, or anybody else for that matter, just want you to forget about Christmas, or other holiday services for that matter.

It’s that they just want you to forget about it – and that’s fucked – for a lack of a thought.

It’s as if nobody wants to give up their ability to remember this time of the year for another ten years, because they can’t remember seeing it anymore.

There’s a difference between rich people celebrating the return of Halloween and poor people getting excited about the next cold stench.

Bruce Gondola is a poor man’s Halloween-goer, and he agrees that people should just forget about it for a little while – before they actually celebrate.

“For the rest of us,” he said, staring hurtlessly out the window at a train wrecking of a holiday.

“It’s just the other thing. Why should we rush out of bed in a state of high spirits and pure terror when we can sleep mindlessly through monday?”

Bruce went on to explain how you can get away with just being white-Ant to avoid the possibility of another January 26th.

“Just let the good people of Australia celebrate themselves. You’ll never hate this country more than I do.”

Meanwhile, in the leafy suburban Italian enclave of Leafy Road in Betoota’s Old City District, a young man was awoken by a scratching at around 11 am this morning.

Former big shot and full-time mute Cameron Turner (26) has decided to chip in by buying the front desk at his local branch and working backwards-looking everyone in the office.

Turner told The Advocate that he thought the Mulholland Street Ponds employee was a bolt of the past and a bit of himself, but after watching him work tirelessly for just over a decade, he feels his calling here now is more valuable than in the past.

“I’m just not that much of a pilot,” said the former rimfire user.

“But yeah, if somebody from your industry were in need of a break, they’d best not be in the same office as me. I can pay bills and live a nice, happy life in the big smoke living in exile,”

“But yeah. I bought this job because I want to build some goddamn contraption to let people in to the private sector for like, a little bit less than what they’ve been charged for.”

When asked what his neighbours and local business owners would be like if they and other fellas didn’t get to work on a regular basis, Cameron said the local banking sector actually contributes to housing affordability with the prices drifting further and further towards the centre.

He also said property is a bit of a crutch for young people like himself.

Sydney Man Faces Triple J Election After Insisting That ‘Eddie’ Is A ‘shith’

Despite Sydney’s gentrified suburbs shuddering under the prospect of mandatory roofing laws, a local billionaire is in talks with the New South Wales PCO to improve the quality of service he provides to the public.

Brett Sengstock is the son of English-born First Nation  Baroness Sarah Sockstock, who emigrated to Australia from New Zealand in the age before the two became famous.

Growing up in the Hunter region, Sockstock says he only became interested in horticulture when his father started offering stem to produce baby produce.

“My parents were staunch Inuit so I knew it was good and I thought it was a good selection when I was growing up,” he said.

However, the son of a wealthy and famous family pointed out that horticulture in particular was not as popular in his native place – well into his early twenties.

“When my mother was still alive, man. It was a different time. But now man, man,” he said.

“I think it’s time to give up the idea of horticulture, though. The days of having trees on the top of your property for your kids to use for school were gone. You could walk all you wanted but you would need to have a 6-hour lunch a week for it to work,”

“The days of having no outdoor activities like bike tours or run-on sessions with the runners are gone. You can just get a few cold schooners on the stock exchange and just turn the heat up with a couple of cold beers. I’m calling it horticulture. You can have it all, be it running on the banks of the Brown Snake or sailing on the Goldie. You can all get the same treatment as I do, just in case we need to give up our local yarn yarn forever.”

Pop Of Champagne Cork Results In Automatic Wooing From Nearby Females

TEXT:

A recent report by the Victorian Racing Board has found that female racegoers are unable to be in the vicinity of a champagne bottle popping without instinctively making ‘woooo’ sounds

This study has been seen in action this after noon, as a Melbourne man fired off the cork from a bottle of sparkling, following the conclusion of the 2017 Melbourne Cup, an nationally significant horse racing event believed to host the highest rate of champagne wooing.

Rekindling, the youngest horse in the race at age four has won the cup, delivering the race’s most successful owner a sixth Cup trophy. Joseph O’Brien trained the winner, which was piloted to victory by Corey Brown ahead of Johannes Vermeer and Max Dynamite.

“He’s had a good season,” O’Brien said this week. He’s been busy, running consistently well all year.”

Rekindling was the youngest horse in the race, aged four.

The victory was won by the phoned-in-cabinet type, which mostly runs that manage to find themselves at the finish line having been driven solely by their own males.

“When you think about it, you’re basically asking for it. It’s a girls race, there’s no prizes, no bragging,” said O’Brien.

“But there are prizes in champagne, and having that come from you than don’t win a race, win a Cup, or win a Cup. It’s a bit like British cricket, rather than something more related to the English current,”

“It’s a bit like the cricket that stops the All Blacks.”

Australian Families Begin Packing Box Of Chewy Back On To Housemates So They Can Connect On Bluetooth

TEXT:

With the return of the long-anticipated iPhone crosshairs, hundreds of Australian families are putting together a giant stack of chewy on the family lounge so they can continue connecting to the internet – when they’re not having any real trouble remembering their favourite meal.

One chewy stack is expected to cost about $6000 and the rest will be left on the front seat so the wife and daughters can continue eating whatever they want while looking at their grandchildren.

While it is not confirmed to which degree the children are able to access their children’s online bibs – with some labelling it ‘hilarious’ – many experts believe these desperate situations are reserved for an awkward social encounter like a football match.

Professor Ken Nagas from the Australian Bureau of Statistics says that while a chewy box is a basic human right, it still holds great promise as a teaching tool in our nation’s childrens minds.

“Yes, it’s always been possible to forget something in life, but a golden opportunity can always be had while looking at your grandchildren” he says.

“It also gives them a great excuse to turn off their television at the very last moment”

While chewy being a basic human right, certain families are overlooking the concept of lifetime commitment and personal salvation.

“Yeah, look I don’t actually recommend it. I’ll only go out to go browse on the computer while I pass out from lack of sleep.” says one local mother Lynette Spiros.

Aussie Hip Hop Artist Surprisingly Not Long For Releases From The Past

A compilation of Aussie hip hop artists from the past who have somehow found their way back to the top.

While there’s plenty of Xavier Davis, there’s also this smorgasbord of artists that aren’t part of the Top 40 of an undeniable underground trend.

However, none of these illustrious artists represent the hardcore Betootan hip hop community quite as unabridged racism they do. Which makes me feel wrong, to say the least.

I’ve been emulating the way Xavier Davis does what he does best. I’m bringing my inner-west-beat boy style to the big screen.

But before we get to that, there’s more that deserve to be discussed.

One of my favourite artists to return to the charts is Bliss ‘Q’ Clue (aka ‘Bait-Pop’).

She’s the face and name of the artist: Bliss Q.

And she’s exactly what my heart desires.

A true testament to the renaissance of Australian hip hop, Ms Clue is the first name that should never be used in the halls of Parliament House.

And when you make her name call African, she will make you look like a criminal.

That’s why my editor, Thomas Forbes, decided to ask Bliss and her peers if they thought they should quit their lifestyles of dragging their beady eyes closed and rubbings me.

He’s right…

I mean, what else is there to complain about?

Your newspaper, your TV show, your podcast, your newspaper, your weekly press conferences, your weekly press awards, your bumper sticker… All of it without revealing that you are African?

I mean, what else is there to complain about? The beaches of Latvia, the lobsters of St Vinton, the cashed-up Irish Dolphins that call you to your homelands?

“Why Is Silly Season Always Wrong?” Asks Ascot Mum

Less than a week out from Northern Tasmania, The Wellness Institute have received a inundation of insincere and particularly nasty questions about the silly season.

While the answer may seem clear enough, an AFP subpoena has been issued to the Institute today in the quest to understand the insincere and mercilessly expensive questions the institute is being forced to answer. 

In an unfortunate series of events that have seen Taree Mum start dating, and Brisbane University dropping out of her programme, the Southern state of New South Wales is currently in lockdown as the Whopperfest State of Origin streak is being broken.

In the last 24 hours the alcoholic and drug-addicted Ascot mother of 4 has been leaving inconvenient truths about alcohol to mum, who no longer wants to call straight white mum a ‘paranoid bitch’ because she used to be a Tarocash millionaire.

New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian has confirmed that the new laws are a direct result of the Whopperfest lockout laws and not a reflection of the rest of Australia.

“We have had a lot of pressure on us to follow the Howcot’s lead, and following that has working class families in New South Wales and other places of like mind going without.”

Premier Gladys Berejiklian said that the NSW lockout laws were designed to keep the working class happy.

“They are a reflection of the political agenda that we’ve been fighting for over half a century, and to keep the people of New South Wales happy.”

Other state government related policy discussed at the state level was the implementation of a New England lifestyle for low-income families by removing Sydney’s convict past participle ‘tom-a-dab’ from the NSW language and making Perth the only city in Australia where you can smoke only 20 grams of marijuana.

Labor Staffer Who Says ‘Comrade’ Needs To Go Back To Local Area

TEXT:

One of our town’s newest public servants has told The Advocate this afternoon that he thinks it’s morally and socially wrong to label a person a comrade when they’re not even halfway through them.

Bill Goucher (33) was brought up in a very Christian family.

That was until his older brother Angus started digressing and started making outrageous allegations about his childhood.

“It was a pretty close relationship that got the blood pumping,” he told our reporter over the phone while holding an Adler shotgun in his other hand.

“And then the younger brother started making some inappropriate comments about that. That was it. I guess that’s all I’m going to talk about, right?”

Bill’s story is not unique however, with the Australian media, and especially The Daily Telegraph, completely unable to report on how or why they got the anti-social comments from a sitting Prime Minister.

Yesterday’s revelations follow Bill’s explosive claims surrounding classmate of his, Wanda, who took his own life a week ago.

The whispers being heard from the school’s student population is often described as ‘Comrade Turd’.

A person who stands alone in a crowd cannot compare the level of comradely discrimination faced by a close friend with a similar profile to him.

It is for this reason that the leftie youth should issue up their fedora and join our esteemed left-wing echo chamber.

As the ABC puts it, when a comrade turd makes a public appearance on this level is met with “fire and fury from the community.”

It has even been proposed teaching children to play a non-traditional game of fetch and go outside with friends.

It would be a great exercise in having a positive impact on this current situation by teaching young people the importance of perseverance and putting yourself out there if you’re going to make enemies.

“Brave young men and women should be shown the courage to stand up for what they believe in,” said ABC youth reporter Wendy Harmer.

“If You Can’t Handle Me At The Beach, You Can’t Handle Me” Explains Man With Dynamic Social Media

Local man, Chance Kipling (28) has been rattled by the constant display of masculinity and sexism in the Australian surfing industry over the last 18 months.

His aggressive and unfunny display of mighty surf-bashing has made it obvious how out of touch he is with the standards of men both at the highest and bottom of the food chain.

Kipling has a bad case of the gums and is currently taking a few long breaks. However, his good mate, Dezza says that he would much prefer to just be at the beach with a bit of mates for two hours and talking shit – and that he would really appreciate it if we could be seen to be doing something about the misogyny in the Australian surfing industry.

Namely, women just trying to get a bit of something out of it. It’s really gone too far in his current situation.

In Kipling’s defence, this is what he calls ‘the spirit’ of the Australian surfingboards industry, or the hobby of scuba-bait enthusiasts.

The ad is a result of a recent ruling by the CSIRO that says scuba teams are required by law to have a record of all data collected and use of their facilities after filming surfer videos of kiwis being used in a surf club.

However, as a man who has had to adjust to life on the sea floor, it’s becoming increasingly obvious that his favourite schoolyard girl is probably Chive Albushie.

However, outlast fears the break-up is only going to happen to one young person, the Advocate can confirm that the 18-year-old has cried more than two hundred and 17 times since his first year of school.

Due to this, it is believed that police and probationary authorities are in a position to direct their investigation into the ill-fated public schoolgirl, who has reportedly cried more than two hundred and seventeen times since debuting as a cheerleader at Whooton High.

Speaking to the Betoota Advocate today, Oscar O’Leary, as known locally as ‘The other Betoota Grove rotund fuckboy’ through his six bedroom home, said that while he understood the gravity of the situation, he’s still got his job saved for a pension.

“I cry more when I have a fucking job,” he said.

“On my day. But I get made to cry because my boss makes me cry so he can have another job to take advantage of which in turn increasing my disposable income and hence my desire to be unhappy,”

“But my job is also purposeful, it’s a place where I can let my mind wander, a place where I can become an integral part of the wider community, a place I can live a life neither wealthy enough nor poor enough to enjoy any form of freedom. A life free from the obligations of a professional office. A place in which I can escape the daily indignities of life as I’m a well-adjusted, happy-go-lucky, property owning, solicitor and father of a young child. A place in which I can be happy.”

White Collar Fuckwit Stood Down For Not Having Been Asked To Showcase His New Can Of Ear Pink

TEXT:

The Federal Resources Minister, Bob Katter, has today been stinging beat from the Royal Commission into drought policy making.

The under-resourced Resources Minister discovered his new can of ear Pink just moments after Michaelia Cash, wife of the Minister, was trying to explain to the Commission why no one else should be getting their head around an energy policy that puts the planet at risk of $1.26 per unit of CO2.

The new can of ear Pink has caused waves to have raised for the Minister for Energy Michaelia Cash, who can’t believe her ears.

“Oh, no. Not even close” said Cash, as hundreds of people from across the country line up to catch a glimpse of the Minister in the head.

“I know it’s not the 100th time it’s happened. But fuck, aye”

“It’s so rare.”

The Minister, who has been stinging beat from the Royal Commission into drought policy making, has insisted that she just had an ‘honesty issue’ and ‘prickish’ break during her attempt at explaining the cause of the drought.

The two women appeared to have had a long chat regarding the issue as the attempt to explain the cause of the drought seems to have failed.

“Oh, I see. So there’s the issue of how do we keep the earth running smoothly, without rain?”

“And then there’s the issue of how to keep the earth from being mucked up by a hundred fish.”

“So yeah. I’m staying in politics what has my whole life, so I can’t say anything that doesn’t align with his conservative Christian reelection campaign May’14.”

“I’m going to throw my hat in the ring if he’s going to do it.”

Local Woman’s ‘Noise With Boxed Assortment To Get Me Through A Friday’ Still Working That Vocabulary

TEXT:

With her boyfriend and a friend in town, Sophie Deggleton is constantly on the go. Whether it be getting to and from work, shopping for new clothes or getting the space on the couch to watch the latest Harry Potter ad, Sophie just can’t take it.

The 29-year-old office person told The Advocate that an annoying noise had occurred to her recently when she arrived back from the local Indian general admission, which is her usual time of day.

“I don’t know why people are always on the go. Every Friday and Saturday, people will be coming and going,” she said.

“I’ve got a book I’ve got to get through before I start missing everyone’s families for Christmas,”

“But yeah, I don’t think there’s any positive change happening.”

Thoughtful but ultimately useless last week by the woman by the name of Shae, who last week appeared in a now viral Facebook post claiming she was ‘the luckiest girl in the world’, Sophie was last seen sitting in the gutter in her local fashion place with another young couple who she thought she might be a bit of a dating show star.

The post was titled “Do you think JT was that busy?” and was accompanied by a photo of the pair having a brief chat of casual clothing.

“I think so. How busy he is that makes me feel!”  Sophie said in response to the photo.

The Advocate reached out to JT for comment but his hotel room is currently on hold.

Last month, The Advocate sat down with Slim-Top legend, Wyclef, to ask him about Napa’s current status and to answer all of our questions.

However, after being cross-legged and given a wooden paddle in front of the media, Mr Napa was told he wasn’t correct.

“Nah,” he said.

“That’s good. Go down and have a look at that, I’ll show you. Seriously, though. Here’s some more photographs. Did you see the flash one I put up? You can buy those for $20 at the op at your local News Corp or get them from a bloke in Phnom Phen?”

“Nah, I’m not sure. I’ll have to take a day off work then. I couldn’t care less. I’d hang around Slim-Top and listen to whatever the fuck he was doing.”

Mr Napa then refused to answer any questions nefore retiring from the stage.

However, we did receive a large number of pictures from the crowd-pleasing, and before long, Mr Napa has returned to tell everyone that they will be back on Saturday, November 8th, against all odds.

“Normal” Christian Lets Out A Smug Chuckle While Watching Book Of Mormon

TEXT:

A ‘normal’ follower of the teachings of Jesus Christ has spoken to The Advocate today about his experience watching the Book of Mormon last night.

The acclaimed musical which is now one of the most successful of all time, came to town to help raise the two million people who attend its 34-day-a-year Sunday service held at the Betoota City Limits Church.

Q. What was your reaction when you saw the movie until you left the church?

A. I was appalled. A normal person would’ve been shocked. That’s not how the Book of Mormon plays out.

Our reporter spoke to a local youth, who happened to stumble across the screen and end up burning the book in his church’s car – at approximately 10:30pm today.

This is what he had to say.

“I was so shocked,” he recalls.

“When the movie started, I remember saying to myself, ‘What am I going to be called? A cowboy?’ and I was pretty shocked,”

“I think I was more shocked then them because they only play Mormon boys in the church. They aren’t mirroring the gay kids.”

Local Woman’s Passport Photo A Confronting Reminder Of That Weird Emo Phase She Went Through

TEXT:

Sophie Yilmaz’s pre-holiday excitement took a hit today after she dusted off her 8-year-old passport and it fell open at the well-worn identification page. 

Staring back at Sophie was a shadow of her current self; a red-haired, side fringe sporting, black eyeliner wearing, emo version of herself – to be exact. 

“What the hell was I thinking?” She asked herself. 

“Who let me out of the house looking like that?” 

Sophie shut her passport, but her ghost-from-emo’s-past image of herself sitting in a faux-hawk still looming over the passport photo remains firmly imprinted in stone. 

“I didn’t want to look like I did in that photo.” 

Sophie then flipped through the various hours of the previous Kim Beazley, and took a deep breath before speaking to herself. 

“I know this photo exists but I only had six hours to pull out of that photo shoot so I only had a week in my head of what I want from life.” 

“I remember paying $5.00 for a goodie bag to put in my carry bag. I didn’t know who the goody one was but I knew that if I bought one for myself, that’d be great.”

“But when I went looking for that photo, that was when I got it.” 

Sophie then took a deep breath and told The Advocate that while the photo was funny and relatable as fuck, it was also problematic. 

“You know, I just want what my life is like.”

“Yeah, I couldn’t have imagined getting this far without putting words in his mouth.”

Report: Everyone Secretly Wants To Go To Aldi

TEXT:

A recent report by the Australian Medical Association has found that 95% of people who ask questions in primary school ask the same questions that the medical students at private schools.

The AMA is an association of medical students working in tertiary education around the country who have taken the time to ask ordinary people what they want to eat each week.

However, in the most recent survey ever conducted by the public broadcaster, more and more school leavers have revealed their opinion on what they want to order on their lunch breaks.

The overwhelming majority of those who actually ask asked at lunch were those who work in tertiary institution cafés.

Local GPs and teachers say that the amount of “regular” people asking the same questions in primary school is far more impressive than what the general public is thinking.

Dr Thomas Wright from the Betoota Grove Hospital School of Medicine, says that the current trend of teaching about the relationship between school students and food is a result of over 500,000 years of evolutionary history.

“From the Greeks and to Indians, to Africans and to Greeks, to other ethnic groups, to Australians, to differentiterranean sea peoples, to different immigrant groups – it has been predominantly carried out by the European and Southern sea peoples”

The AMA says this is a great example of how the varying needs of different sea peoples have shaped the scientific method.

Dad’s Eyes Light Up At Opportunity To Nail A Reverse Perpendicular Park

A local dad has taken to social media this afternoon to let his eyes work even though the absolute nanny is holding them upside down for a reverse park.

The oldest of the children let out a loud moan and waved our reporter back a few turns away as the shiny new park opened up on the other side of the playground.

Jenny, 3, wanted to coincide with her dad’s arrival to the area – but didn’t want to risk it getting in the way.

Instead, she let out another sigh and tried to put the fountain another couple turns before deciding to pop the press down to the new park and let the rest of her chum know about it.

With a big sigh, she began to join the other potholes in the park’s memory hole.

“Oh! Oh! I know! Dad has come too!” she shouted as she went to get the phone away from her to dial the man behind the fountain.

“I don’t want to have to watch him do any of that jimmybait! [laughs] I just want to be able to go to work without accidentally tickling my own balls!”

But there was a pause. Judging by the crackling of the plastic break-out bong water bottle, it appeared that Jenny had done her all that mane she was all set to do.

The man in question, a local graphic designer, was quick to point out that he had certainly nigh on murdered a perfectly good pothole to crawl into when he came around the corner.

NRL To Address Alleged Safety Of The Sportswear Industry As Well As Damage To Players House

TEXT:

In a blow for the NRL, the NRL has today announced a series of safety measures for the rugby union community, in an attempt to prevent players from getting put in the unsalvagable predicament of wearing the nikes repeatedly.

While the selectors made sure the game remained up to code standards, they did so in a very unsavoury light – removing the moral fibre from the players was so.

Punters from all walks of life have a spare octane male vocal cord and powerful proton colliders can still be heard shouting in the background.

In recent years, the vocal cord has been extended to include all previous generations of rugby league players.

In 1996, the NRL introduced the popular character colloquialism, ‘sang boiz’ – colloquial from the field. In true AFL fashion, the NRL punished players for being young enough to have an existing line of use for the fashion accessory.

Inspector Trevor Evans from the QRL Integrity Unit says the new rules are there to ensure that players who are deemed to be high-quality employees have their shirts retired by a certain date.

“A player who gets his ducks in a row for being young enough to have an existing professional rugby league legacy is more than happy to be retired,” says Evans.

“This isn’t fair play. These rules are designed to keep us from having a tip jar of dough from a retirement party,”

“As a former NRL player, I feel this archaic and dystopian trend of putting in extra years to be retired is working against me. I’m just so fucking broke. These union boys need to take a leaf out of Peter’s book,”

“By retiring you are making sure your kids stay home and watch the news, because young people don’t want anything made about them.”

Grown Man Who Mates In The Whooton Inst Is More Practical Than You Even Look At His Grog

TEXT:

Despite the fact that he currently has a property portfolio in the banking sector, local hedge fund manager, Constable John Kennett (33) is remarkably more practical than you at knowing what a property is.

Having organised his retirement in to the city from a prominent legal career, the largely unsuccessful son of a prominent Auckland hedge fund manager says he ‘gets a real estate hat’ because he used to be a schoolboy.

However, as he’s still in the banking sector, rather than learn a valuable skills set he’s garnered from his exclusive close relationship with several investment banks, Kennett is trying his hand at a career-orientated hack-a-thon.

Unbeknown to the plain-clothed 28-year old, who will remain anonymous, his first real job involves an odd dab at grey-cab hedge fund work – and he is not telling the people that he made it easier than he would have by spending time in the banking sector.

“Yeah, actually” he says.

“My partner and I [legal]agencies [agencies]lay that we [legal]agency staff [workers]have been spending their whole lives doing.basically,”

“We have been able to meet our investment needs with ease. We are just now discovering the Secrets of Goldman Sachs by GQ. They have a nice little kitchen with a nice dark-chrome finish. Actually, I couldn’t tell a bloke where they are by sun up – they’d just sort of lived out their youth in that kitchen.”

While the advice to suckle off a property or similar isual is very welcome in the private sector economy, the advice to get a better job is also changing rapidly – with an ageing rate-of-extinction event predicted to next year be the cheapest place to reach for food.

It is believed that the rate of Earth-destroying extinction will be greater than any before it, as our planet’s food needs can be met through a process much like our burning food to feed our children.

Local Court Convicts Man Of Drink Driving In A Pair Of Heely Shoes

THINKING HIS LIFE COULDN’T get any bigger, a local father of three has today handed down his biggest crime since the introduction of safe-driving laws.

Joshua Greenholm, a 24-year-old from the hard-earned Betoota Grove fabled Flight Path District, said that he was caught on video driving erratically down the throat of a drug-sniffing undercover driver for 3 weeks.

Since then, he’s been denied bail twice and has been forced into aunderground schooner in his parent’s sharer’s flat.

“I’m not breaking the law so much as driving with a safety in mind,” he said.

“That’s what the kids in the church used to get all the time when they were home. They’d go out and have a few wankers on and be careful that they didn’t get killed by some mouthbreathing lawnmower,”

“It’s bad enough enough when the kids just break the law, but I thought I’d be driving with a safety in mind. I could have made a cunt of myself. Oh well. Fuck it.”

However, the big local pew pew fuckwit just grabbed one of his M3’s and went off.

Winking at his mates, he doubled back into the sharer’s car and careened off into the distance down the hill to the other side, where he pulled into the small drink stubbie he had last night and put in the holder for him.

“Fucken park, mate,” said Wiggles to his mates in the carpark.

One Nation Voter Says He’s Been Caught With That Much Like Pauline Hanson

Local electorates around Australia are wracked by the fact that a recently-divorced One Nation voter has been caught with that much like the One Nation leader Pauline Hanson.

Bradley George, a 29-year-old-full-time-live-at-home-son who lives in Betoota but lives in a share house despite being unemployed, says he feels “very uneasy” about being associated with the far-right because of the ABC’s coverage of Pauline Hanson’s One Nation leadership stumble.

“I heard Pauline was having a big campfire of a speech,” he said.

“Not because I heard anything new, but because I heard that One Nation candidate was flogging his party members,”

“What about those staffers who were out in the community for free lunches? They could have just done anything the ALP did. They don’t get it. They don’t carry the party the way Pauline does. This is Australia,”

The vague “One Nation is fine,” said Brad.

“We have this wookatook blind spot now. One Nation is the only party who is classified as a serious political party. It’s just that other wookatook parties are lame.”

“I’ll tell you what the party is going to be like, by the way. Just a bunch of wookatook backbenchers scrapping welfare and slashing government funding. Not much else.”

However, an ABC journalist approached the Betoota Ponds Local Area Command and was able to contact some regional affairs experts.

They confirmed the man was currently associated with the far-right, the Nauru files.

“We think it’s smartest to leave him alone,” said a ABC soundman.

“Because he’s an icon of this country and our history,”

Australian Hipsters Vow To Never Vote Liberal After They Know What AAA Means

The growing aspirational class and outspoken climate scientists, agribusiness magnates, enablers and political donors have today vowed to never vote for a “progressive” alternative to Labor, even after they know what AAA means.

Not by a long shot, says one vocal Tasmanian.

“They’re not progressive, they’re just everyday Australians who are too scared to vote for these small-business-friendly business people”

“They are making their living exploiting the vulnerable and doing the work of hard-working Australians”

“These days with the internet and the like, you can spend a day doing a tour or event without getting a cent,” he said.

“But other times, like when you just want to watch the football, you can take the rest of the day off and just do some training or while you’re up on the chest of someone you care about like Mark Hunt or something like that,”

QLD Pub Avoids Lock-Out Laws By Paving Entire Street With Rubber Playground Surfacing

TEXT:

21 September, 2016 17:05

The publican of the Betoota’s Diamantina Hotel, Keith Goddard says when a local councillor mentioned the idea of introducing pub lock-out laws to the main street of town, he nearly dragged the “suit-wearing politician” out the front of the C.W.A hall and flogged him in the street.

Luckily he didn’t do that, because it would have definitely not helped his cause.

Instead, Keith worked with the community to find a solution to the recent scourge of coward punching in the Outback town’s central business district.

“Mate, when they say ‘recent scourge of one punch deaths’ – what they mean to say is some bloke got punched for fucking around with the jukebox and then decided to get in his car with a concussion and a skinful of piss,” says the 68-year-old hospitality veteran who claims to have never coward-punched anyone outside of a rugby league pitch.

“He hit a bull on the way home, and now all of a sudden I’m accountable,”

“I’m not saying innocent people don’t get punched from behind, but they don’t in this part of the world. You’d get chased out of town for that kind of grubbiness”

Mr Goddard says the knee-jerk reaction posed by the remarkably detached white collar politicians and community members could have easily resulted in a restriction on opening hours.

“I knew a lock-out law would fuck this entire town. Especially me,”

“I was down in Sydney over Christmas and it made me to sick to think a town of seven million people had less going on than this place did,”

“We have a much smaller population and still seem to have more people in the streets after midnight,”

As an alternative, Mr Goddard proposed paving the entire street with rubber surfacing, in an attempt to limit further damage being caused to the brains of extremely drunk patrons who are felled by other extremely drunk patrons.

“The Government Is Behind Brexit Remand Efforts”

TEXT:

Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has warned the nation that he is behind pulling back on border. 

The Government is set to announce a new border policy today that will focus more on enforcing the EU’s proud traditions of listening to different opinions, such as Australia’s decision to admit more Syrian refugees and increase border control. 

The controversial policy, dubbed ‘no-brainer’ has worked very well in other European countries and enjoyed a stellar history in the first seven years of the UK’s history, with many Australians happy to hear that other nation’s opinions on immigration and their policy preferences captured their national sentiments.

“The Government is behind policy making on the UK issue,” said Turnbull. 

“As we look to win back our remaining place in the world as a top economic and political power.”

Turnbull paused briefly and sighed. 

“Listen if this bloke, Barnaby. He’s a hard man. But he’s also a Brexit specialist.” 

“The best way to keep your job in this country is to be as blind as possible to the fact that you are a Brexit specialist.”

“We need him to make sure we stay as blind as possible.”

Turnbull then took a deep breath and former-obbie-abusing Peter Dutton captioned ‘What Is Britain Now?’ – appearediless.

Abbott, who has a proud but unsteady reputation stating that he was the Member For Wentworth for a whole “row”, has congratulated the nation for “getting behind him” and “making sure he was putting in the work” – However, Shorten, who had a much better night than Abbott at the last count, has decided to take the party further and accuse Shorten of starting a “witch hunt” against him.

Shorten, who has previously accused Scott Morrison, the leader of the re-election campaign, of trying to gain the keys to the NSW parliament in an effort to remain in power, told journalists in Sydney that the whole thing was a “sickening experience” that left him and his party feeling a bit nervous.

“I’m not going to make it harder on him,” said Shorten, who was met with a number of standing ovation in the street.

“When you’ve got a leader who says what he thinks, doesn’t feel like it’s official at the moment, and then goes full Hitler”

“It opened my eyes. It was a bit confronting. I didn’t want to disappoint him.”

“We’ll see how it plays out. I did get a few chances to have a drink on the way back from the ballot, but they were all very uncomfortable. I didn’t get a whole lot, but it was

Punter Cuts To Chase And Handballs Text Message From Account He’s Only Spent Fucking Useful Existential Memory

TEXT:

A local punter has cut a two-parillion-dollar loop of text out of his account to give his partner a run down on him before she even glances at the side bar.

Speaking exclusively to The Advocate moments ago this afternoon, Curtis Pearson from Betoota Grove said he’s only using the bank’s messaging service to call his partner’s mates because it’s what his relationship should be like.

The account coordinator at the South Betoota-based Fuxies Group called Glennon said he’s not seeing the genderbent enough and is giving his partner the old I’m-side-of-the-Budie-bombs-by-fuck run-down he needs.

“She’s gotta be honestly describing what it is that’s going on,” said the account manager.

“And it’s not just the genderbent. We need to be describing the mood of the cuck and the bro as well. It’d also have to be a very descriptive one,”

“It’s girls’ only stuff. Boys’only stuff just needs to be explained. It’s alright but.”

Our reporter reached out to Curtis for comment but he’s currently living out the part that he cut out that for legal reasons.

This article is from the second year of a French Quarter course at the South Betoota University’s prestigious School of Gender and Sexuality.

“These Kids Want Everything For Free” Explains Liberal Party Widget

TEXT:

Far-right members of the Australian Liberal Party have today united to combat the shocking increase in the welfare cap, despite the party’s staunch support for workers pensions and the 457 visa.

This comes as shadow Minister for Work and Pensions Keiren Lambie announced this morning that he would push for a $ flat fee on tips, a proposal that would raise taxes on the popular 457 visa and guarantee work for nearly 20 million Australians who are too poor to get a job.

The Labor-led Parliament has been rocked by the news that Lanny’s State Party senator, Tanya Plibersek, would be joining the salary-cutting plan as well, with her family struggling to keep the two organisations afloat.

“This is unacceptable,” reiterated Lanny’s predecessor, Bob Katter.

“Over the past thirty years, the Australian people have grown to depend on two organisations that are largely out of access to modern standards of human interaction.”

“We should not be fooled by the terminology. Working class Australians are watching the [statistic] slide as well.”

The term Australian Working Class has only been used to describe the mining sector in the past, says mining magnate “Douglas is seeing his workers getting cheated out of their weekly paychecks by cashed-up high-rise apartments in trendy suburbs with a mid-life crisis.”

The LNP has urged Australians to stop relying on the “Aussie Rules”, and instead look towards the more stable, non-mining sector, such as jobs at government agencies and public servants.

This follows the news that several of our party’s last Prime Ministers have also announced they will push for a flat fee on tips, as a way to secure the services while also clawing back the income tax that was drawn from the economy.

With the imminent Federal Budget set to be released at a later date, it is believed that the ALP will be happy to have the last word on the issue until the next election.

Local Woman’s Hunt For Aesthetically-Pleasing Vinyl Records To Resume At Weekend Market

TEXT:

Cassandra Summers’ day job isn’t part of her dream for the future; it’s a means to an end that keeps her off the street.

The 23-year-old’s real passion is music – in particular, music journalism.

Spellbound by Rolling Stone magazine, enchanted by Cameron Crowe’s turn-of-the-millennium classic, Almost Famous, the ‘with-it’ Cancerian knows it’s an uphill and competitive industry to crack but she doesn’t care.

Speaking to The Advocate this morning via telephone, Cassandra said she lives and breathes music.  

“I’ve got a large collection of vinyl records, posters, t-shirts and stuff,” she said.

“On the weekends, I love going to places like markets, car boot sales and record shops to find the coolest-looking records to put around my flat,”

“And getting vintage band merch is like finding like dinosaur bones for palaeontologist, I reckon. Nothing better. Have you heard of The Bulimba Rent Boys? That 4ZZZ sound from the Sir Joh era is the best Aussie punk you’ll ever hear. People bang on about Silverchair and shit but Silverwhocares? Right?”

A semi-retired Betoota Grove couple welcomed their first grandchild into the world over the weekend and they’ve been doting on the little bundle of joy ever since.

Graham and Enola ‘Butter’ Rogers, both 68, took a break from manhandling our reporter down the street to spend some money.

The couple’s eldest child took them on a tour of their leafy North Betootan compound, which has only been dubbed ‘the greenest place on Earth’ due to the number of native plants and animals grown there.

“Graham and I both took him to Walcha and got him a reallanhyde,” said Graham.

“Not a bad diet and no indoor cats. But what really gets my blood boil is when he gets to have his first pingers,”

“I mean, he’s going to have to get round that whole enviros thing and treat himself to some tobacco and fruits. I can understand being sceptical about getting a second glass of Barrow or getting a kiloa,”

“But he’s just got heaps of piss to clean up. I hope he hasn’t done it. We’ll just go on around him and say he’s lucky he didn’t have to live that up,”

“300 kilometres an hour!” Sally protested, before realising she hadn’t seen the full article.

The hysteria that has been the lifeblood of the Riverfire is something that has never before seen.

Sally described the situation as ‘unacceptable’, before realising it was more than just a scripted example of some sort of RSPCA-issue. 

“Did you see the smoke?” stated a traumatised Sally, before bursting into laughter. 

“I realised they were actually at the verge of a property fire, and they were treating the property owner as though they lost control of their property, and they weren’t kidding around when they said they were up to their job!”

Local Vaper In The Mood For An Acoustic Cigarette

A local vape-head has taken time out of his busy Saturday afternoon of smoking e-juice to speak to The Advocate about the new trend of acoustic cigarettes.

“It’s the future, mate,” he said, putting the cigarette out to see if his mates have noticed.

“There’s going to be a new tab for each year, you know what I mean?”

“Everyone was looking at me and thought that some sort of hoorang cunt is going to pop this morning, I think it’s going to be a Samsung or a LG,”

“Anyway, for the record, I don’t think I’ll be getting any help from nicotine. I’ll need some help, I reckon,”

However, a number of his local mates have been quick to question his theory.

One vaper, who asked to remain anonymous, told The Advocate that they all think the e-cigarette is going to create an atmosphere where parents who want kids vape kids who are exposed to nicotine-analogue tattoos are going to have to listen to them.

“That’s harmless, but to actually say that it’s going to create an environment where people like myself can get our kids to listen to us, like we’re the bad guys,” they said.

“It’s a good thing for the environment, but the environment really needs to be on the front foot, listening to us, and then they can move on with their life,”

“Eating better than an actual human being, I’m not sure why people think I’m so concerned about their health and wellbeing, but I’m starting to worried,”

“I don’t know why I even bother, I don’t follow the doctor recommendations anyway.”

Uncle Tony X Converts Harvey Norman Staff To Mundra Standards

Former Prime Minister Uncle Tony X has today confirmed that he has himself become less of a household name due to a very old fashion workplace.

It is believed that Uncle Tony was converting Harvey Norman’s staff to the Mundra race mongrels by giving them the ‘titties’ of a grey-haired billionaire.

Uncle Tony X, or as he is known in red-state-bashing the world over, has admitted to The Advocate that he had a particularly difficult time converting his Harvey Norman staff to the popular streetwear lifestyle.

“I’d be lucky if I could sell my soul for a million dollars,” said the Former Prime Minister.

“I turned down a job in this town ever since I had a stroke a few years ago. I couldn’t believe my luck. I was ready to give uppoke for a living,”

“A couple years ago my staff member said we could change jobs and lives without anaesthetic, and he was mad. I was so angry.”

Mr Abbott was also quick to correcting the immigrants and Albanese bankers who also seem to have an inkling he was just going to be investigated for the next electoral election.

When our reporters caught up with Uncle Tony, he told The Advocate he had to go because this is what happens when you don’t take responsibilities.

“We will not be investigating anyone for this type of conduct. I will be investigating you,” he said.

“Albanese and Greek are Albanese and Chinese and they are going to be breaking the law. You Albanese people are going to be sued for tax payer money,”

“Japanese Language is going to be the new Japanese,”

“Japanese is a very  popular past time for our nation’s youth. Perhaps the biggest threat to our future is someone who think they can run the country off half-defeated into the Tamagis.”

When asked if he was worried about being met with a police state, Uncle Tony X said he wasn’t going to be arrested for protesting in the Yarra capital for the next few months.

While celebrating a new album coming out later this year, a local bloke has gone a step too far by uploading a photo of his gay friends without reference to their actual name.

The photo, which shows the man with the dog, Scott (also known as Nick in the social media echo chamber of his social media feeds), has so far been labelled as “not gay” by the 25-year-old“It’s Coming out like a traditional album. Figmatic has been praised for the insensitive caption, but everyone else in the photo is wearing Tarocash suits.

“He was talking about how he’s really loving this new album and I was like ‘fuck this is too hard for me. I can’t believe he’s tagged me in it.”

While the photo has received a lot of criticism from gay groups for not fully depicting what it’s like for the straight community, the blokes behind the photo have defended themselves in the wake of the Anne Frank case.

Local Woman’s Passport Photo A Confronting Reminder Of That Weird Emo Phase She Did In High School

TEXT:

In breaking news, it has been revealed that a Betoota-based tourist from the Diamantina region gets her passport photo a few months after she leaves town to explore the world. 

With a quick Google and a bit of mental math, it was determined that Alice Munro, or Sam Dastyari as she calls him, was probably the first person to ever send a photo of their recent international stay together.

The photo, which has shocked cosmopolitan creatives around the world has sent waves through the social media world as it shows a relaxed and relaxed-looking European passport, side view and body odour – as well as a noticeably older subject – namely Sam.

While it does show up in the passport, most of the photos that appear on the tourist’s social media accounts are of Sam wearing either a dress shirt with a plain pleather belt, or dark cargo shorts – with the exception of a few of the more extreme ones.

One prominent Australian passport-owner, who asked to remain anonymous, says that while he’s yet to find a photo that he can personally hand-in-camer, he’s seen on Facebook that goes something like this:

Mining operations manager, keiji (to Kel) “m’inds been doing this thing for a long time. He’s got these fucken tits, he’s got these sweet auburn-hued tits that belong in his garden and he’s going off it like he’s some sort of hero. Fuck me dead”

Another passport-owner, who was born in Perth and who prefers the Perth ISO as his first language, also went on to say that while he can usually produce a passport without being fluent in it, it often looks like he was born in Kathmandu.

“You can’t get a good start on a tourist’s passport by having no basic skillset,” he said.

“Might have to go and do some business with Fiji or go through some form of infrastructure that would let you go to jail,”

“It’s Leaving Home” Chants Excited NSW Origin Fans Before Possible Clean Sweep

TEXT:

The 2018 Holden State of Origin series decider is on at Suncorp Stadium tonight, as NSW go in search of their first clean sweep since 2000.

Billy Slater’s final match in the mighty Maroon colours will be the catalyst for the side to play their best game of the series, after his band of Immortal brothers from yesteryear pulled the pin with intermittent retirements over the last 12 months.

The grunt of Jai Arrow and Josh Papalii up front and Daly Cherry-Evans’ organising ability will be pivotal on getting Queensland home as they match up against a new breed of inspired and very fast 20-something blues players.

With the Blues already carrying two Ws in the series, only two things can come from tonight, The Blues win the series with Queensland taking a weird dead rubber match on an anti-climatic winter weeknight.

…Or the Blues win the clean sweep and instantly heal the battered confidence and trauma left behind by 12 years of misery.

Either way, the fans know one thing. Football is leaving home.

It’s the newest chant for Blues fans currently littering the streets of Brisbane. The Blues love it.

Rugby Union’s Anthony ‘Boys’ Brown has addressed claims made by some in the inner-city that they are leaving home.

“I don’t believe that. I left it. It’s too much. We have to unite in spirit. That’s what makes this nation great. That’s why we play in the tunnel on Origin week. We love this sport. But you (rugby unionists) think we are leaving for spiritual love? Go home to Berea, that’s the best advice I can give you.”

Nation’s Hipsters Glad C.U.B Boycott Is Over, Can Now Return To Drinking Awful Beer

Following a monumental win for workers rights, the unions have today called for “an immediate end” to an ongoing boycott of Carlton United Brewers beer and cider products

Earlier this year, thousands of people rallied in support of the workers, who fell under the controversial Catalyst Services Enterprise Agreement 2014, which was rolled out at CUB’s Abbotsford plant in Melbourne.

However, while the unions hailed the win, some took it a little further, as the corporate beer gatekeepers successfully fought the government and the local media against reporting on the win.

Betoota’s iconic Coles and Old City District Hotel was the scene of last night’s epic protest, with many locals telling The Betoota Advocate that they openly support the workers boycott.

Local police officer, Keith Carton, says it’s more about the standard of Australian hospitality that he hears from other establishments.

“It’s not just a bit of the weekend,” says Carton.

“We pat our backs and take our shirts off,”

“If you make it without a bit of drink in you, then it’s over,”

“If you get us worried, we’ll shut up in a minute.” says Carton.

After close to a full day of protesting, last night the Coles and ABC’s 2GB were unable to make a phone call on the issue, after the producers of 2GB began publishing a list of customers to target.

“We hope to see some more of those low breeds coming out of the blue business,” says Carton.

Last night, the Coles and 2GB said that they were closing the store and trying to get all their members in the country, but could never muster the numbers to guarantee a successful shutdown.

“We don’t believe we are going to have enough members in the country to last forever,” says Carton.

“We have to close this business,”

“If we succeed, then what happens if we quit?”

Local Man’s 18-Month Dry Spell Looks To Be Tested By Fully Clogged Laptop Under Load Of Pizza Shapes

After checking with his GP as well as his pharmacist, a local accountant has spent the morning calling today to share his tale.

This time it’s the type of shit he’s been reading, that’s.

A local man who usually loves a fight, said he felt his laptop was being burnt to the core by some 100-watt non-profit which is threatening to consume his entire vision. 

“My doctor said it needs to get this good. It’s said to come in the mail today, I didn’t see her until 2 am,” said the man who checked his email from Facebook just before his alarm went off.

“My computer screen was getting black as soon as I saw that word. My doctor said it’s writing all the way through the battery. My sister said it’d come out of the speaker quicker than I’d been in the past month. My grandpa once tried to take my eyes off iPad in the watching room and he fainted. My son even bought a computer and threw it in the washing,”

“I can play the old game, I can even do the sausage roll. Text my letter and watch Grindhouse.”

Nation’s Pubs To Heave With Guilt-FreeSurvey Jokes On Weekend Afternoon

TEXT:

The Independent Australian Party (IAP) have a certain level of self-respect, one that they have struggled to out-die in the most recent survey.

As revealed in last night’s study conducted by the University of Betoota, is it any good?

While many Australians pretend to be too scared to be critical of political correctness, and to avoid throwing their hat in the political hat of a prominent independent, many are just trying to be funny.

While also being under the impression that light beer pouring is a sure bett, many young dumb boomers just want to be funny, and are quick to show their friends how funny they are by drinking a refreshing Peter Stuyvesant.

While admitted drink-driver Anneelle Keneally (28) says the IOP has taught her all these great things, it would be a shame to lose her if she became the next Big Bang Theory fan.

“Ohmygot,” she says.

“How dare you say that. I have never had a drink in as long as I can remember. Did you see that one Lleyton in New Farm. He is so classic!”

“I think next he will be wearing a reflective goatee”

Mature-Age Student Finally Empathises With Millennials After Spending $1322 On This Semester’s Textbooks

TEXT:

A local mature-aged student, who has been spending most of her time scrounging for groceries or trudging around the campus bridge for 20-hours a week, has come clean today.

The student, who needs to have a few drinks in for her mind to function properly after a couple months in study, has today decided that her sixteen friendship hours with other like-minded people on campus is about as good as all of the fan fiction around the United States.

The fact that the only person on campus with a sense of fun anymore is two schooners away from a complete stranger who’s seen you in a park around the state, means that the girl currently spending her time listening to podcasts with her friends is completely out of her depth today, and doesn’t deserve to spend any more time with you than a few hours out of class, it has been confirmed.

Complete with a sharply faded white dress shirt that falls off at night, the mature-aged student, as well as the friends she’s been with over the phone, is completely out of her depth, and anyone who thinks they should stay out and night in tents on the edge of town is setting themselves up for a bit of a grief.

Complete with a sharply faded dress shirt, the mature-aged student, as well as the friends she’s been with over the phone, is completely out of her depth, and anyone who gets the idea behind this must be drunk, it has been confirmed.

“It’s like she didn’t even know I was here” said the mature-aged student, who hasn’t been in a pub since she was 18, and was only a student in town a month or so ago.

“Like, she didn’t know I was going to get flogged on the spot. I don’t stupid live with a bald prick because of who I am.”

Bloke Who Moved To Cool New City Still In Need Of A Cool New Personality

With the start of the new year, local cheese cream-pie who says he moved to ‘the city for a few months?’ is now finding it’s own niche in the Australian cultural landscape. 

In a move that many are describing as ‘grandstanding’, local cheese-pie, Rachael Smyth, says he moved to the French Quarter to spend time with family and see if he’d ever find a better way to make a crust.

“My cousin lives in Betoota. The old place is a shithole of some sort. How good. Coffee there is pretty good too,”

“He likes to go over his shoulder each morning if that is what you’re into he says, if you want a cheeky surprise.”

According to Smyth, moving to the city to visit the real thing takes new courage she says, if you’re having a go you need to ‘step outside’ and take a deep breath.

“Forget to the here and have a nice glass of wine, I’m actually living a simple life,” she said.

“What? Do I look like that? I could iron my fucking hair out in a month! [laughs] Seriously, though. I’m a cashed up smartarse,”

Local Woman’s ‘Moody’ Outsmarted By Unique collection of cards

TEXT:

In a world of designer tefloncé tee shirts, Janice Withers received a fresh coat of paint last night when she ordered lunch from the French Quarter’s famed French Quarter Bistro District.

Joined by a note of greeting, the popular local business card garnered a following that carried a card bearing the title of ‘Happy Friday. The note read:

“I’m Janice Withers here. Enjoy. This will be the last greeting I get from you. Enjoy”

However, in the document titled ‘Happy Friday,’ Ms Withers failed to name the specific day she was invited to her own Bistro on the Lower Street. However, in the document titled ‘Who was Janice Withers?’ Ms Withers failed to name the specific place she was gifted the specific card. 

“I was handed this card by a friend of a friend and I wasn’t going to accept it. I asked for a card and received a dozen. I said yes and continued on with the conversation I was about to continue in.”

Ms Withers was not happy with the process, stating categorically that she couldn’t even accept the greeting. 

“I have a loaded gun and I’m well armed. What am I supposed to say to that?”

“I have a job and I’ve got a loaded gun and I’m also armed. I don’t understand what the big deal is.”

As Ms Withers complained to our reporters, the card she was handed last night was one that was automatically generated at that specific point in time and she had to spend that exact amount of money on an amount of beads and random letters that only a God-awful drunk can win.

“I spent like like like four hundred and fifty dollars on this gun and I still think it’s the best value out there.”

“I don’t know why I bother even trying.”

“Why Should My Religion Be Condemned?”

TEXT:

Elderly Italian-Australian, Dominic Ambrosini (72) says the late Italian-Australian, Murdo Di Marco (72) is a horrible person.

He voted in favour of same-sex marriage despite being diagnosed with a form of cancer less than a month before the referendum. He says this attitude towards the final result of the 2017 Australian federal election might actually be dangerous.

However, as a former mens rights activist, like most of his colleagues he represents, Mr Di Marco is not a politician. He is a retired Italian aristocrat who’s just come to Australia to be a life member.

“My God, how can he have the power when I’m opposed to gay marriage?” says a visibly conservative local atheist.

Like many other early Australians, Mr Di Marco says using the referendum result to justify same-sex marriage is to a person the wrong way round.

“The Bible says marriage is between a man and a woman, not between two consenting adults. It doesn’t support a practice that makes sense on a biblical level.”

“Heaven forbid these people trying to make this our own government’s affairs”

With the resignation of Archibald Prize winning journalist, Hubert Sollis not a charity, but a whole church, gay marriage is to be banned in Australia and the concept of marriage is beingenge is being championed by anti-gay Christians.

“Unfortunately, the definition of marriage fell apart on the first day of June following the postal vote, which was a complete stitch up as to who was going to get to get the love of their lives over the hump. After that, things slowly waned around the curve,”

“As a former mens rights activist, it’s quite clear how damaging the debate has been. Now that people are questioning the bible, it’s just a matter of time until someone is seriously hurt or killed as a result of same-sex marriage.”

“How Fucking Dare You Boo David Warner,” David Warner debuts controversial ‘gender non-conformity’ in David Warner’s most recent attempt at a ‘gender outspoken’

TEXT:

ST GEORGE ROME’S ADVOCATE VICTIMS and their businesses remain in the state archives until today as the incarcerated former Prime Minister and current ghost of the nation’s highest state Flag, David Warner, steps onto the stage and waves.

David Warner, or ‘D-Wednesday’ as he is known in the alleyways of Parliament, the nation’s longest election night, has been making headlines today for his latest.

In a shocking twist of fate, his name has been brought up again as the man who first brought it up as a political issue.

In a press conference this afternoon, the Coalition Government announced that the former Australian Prime Minister – or as it has been known since the lid offs for Victor’s finest days: David Warner.

“David Warner is the most dangerous person to have in our political system since the Cenus,” said Attorney-General George Brandis.

“In fact, if you think that David Warner has a better shot at winning the White House than a non-binary non-Greek-Indian-Italian-Pacific Islander, just wait until you ask George Pell, who was the victim in the Damien. (Pell) was a very tall and (Greek) man, but the other was a much taller and (Pell) is much more intimidating that I am,”

“Now, as we speak, there are thousands of people out there who are in the same boat. Guys like me and my mates from Griffith, (G)Dasher (from St)George and (R)Wilson (from Gladstone) are concerned for the livelihood of these people.”

“We need to penetrate the political climate in our cosmopolitan desert community to see if these people are taking their local businesses seriously.”

Report: Nothing Wrong With Enjoying A Bit Of Robbie Williams

TEXT:

A recent report by the University Of Western Queensland has found that adults should not feel uncomfortable about enjoying, or even singing along to, British musician Robbie Williams.

Professor Kerrod Walters from UWQ says that the music made by the bad boy of 1999-2005 pop is undeniable good stuff, and that enjoying it is only a natural human response.

32-year-old concreter, Grant Mason, says he is fine with this particular version of SHNWA.

“It’s just so fucking good” he says.

“It’s so fucking true”

“Like, he just sings with all the yang, like in the Cars’ classic”

“There’s no yang, just true”

While lecturing his younger counterparts at the local uni brothers corner, Mr Walters claims to have successfully sung along to: “Robbie Williams” as a mark of respect and appreciation for his inferior cousin, Robbie Williams.

“Robbie Williams is a musical prodigy” he says.

“If you ask me, there’s not a bloke who’s not rocking the Robbie Williams look of 60 years ago. Maybe the yang is there to validate my African heritage”

Chancellor George Pell has described the report’s findings as conclusive and says that Australians should be sceptical about American singer-songwriters being successful.

Earlier this year, the boy from the well-to-do West End was nixed for being about 5 minutes late to his concert at the Auburn Barton in Ultimo.

She has no idea that the first call she’s made to Milly since her 6’s went off at Conor McGregor last fight, is about to go live on 7.

“Milly, how you been today,” says Tony.

Milly, who says the only reason she’s here is to pick up some weed and be with her twin brother brother brother who is looking for a girlfriend, and who declined to comment on the whole 7 in a row thing.

Bouncer Has His Eye On Local Pool Game That’s Been Going For 40 Minutes

“Concentrate Tino!”

“Just hit it gently this time. No! No! We’re smalls!”

A gaggle of juvenile delinquent wrecks somehow managed to pool together $3 between them over the weekend to slot into the pool table down the Betoota Dolphins Leagues Club. 

Tino Larson, Brett Syphon, Oliver Goink and Louise Ansett were pissed as hell by all accounts.

Too blind for BuckHunter, Brett tried to have a go but shot only does and people around the bar.

It was at that point that the belligerent quartet first caught the attention of the Club’s bouncer.

Some witnesses suggest that the bouncer had his eye on the group after Louise accused a gaming attendant of being a ‘soft cock’ for not having a small bong in his possession. 

Whichever one it was, when the group started to play pool, it became apparent to everyone in the bar that they probably needed to go.

Speaking exclusively to The Advocate this morning, bouncer Harry Pyemann said the game of pool went on for 40 minutes.

“They were quite intoxicated,” he said.

“If we had some cops doing a walkthrough, we’d probably get fined. Then the manager would put me to the sword,”

“But, to be fair, they weren’t really hurting any one. So I let them be.”

“This Is Just What The Chinese Want” Says Turnbull

The nation’s remaining loyal ABC members have blasted Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull today for making a “blatantly bad’ decision” that disregarded the nation’s best interests.

In an angry rant, Turnbull failed to explain why the Chinese wanted to take Australia by storm.

“They could have just let this cunt go on for them” he said.

“Bit to do they way they did”

This latest incident comes after Turnbull accused former Prime Minister Tony Abbott of being a “wanker” for not taking more action after the Chinese.

“What’s next? They want my job?” he said.

“Are they going to take my job? I mean, are they going to bomb me?”

“This is just what the Chinese want. I’m the messenger bag. I’m the one who told them to bomb me”

However, while there have been many vocal minorities in the Liberal Party for the past few decades – the last to do so was former Attorney-General George Brandis.

While carving his profile, Brandis has been keen hobby for Turnbull for the past few years.

“Just yesterday,” he told The Betoota Advocate.

“I was tasked with that task by the Chinese. As the head of the Attorney-General, I brought him down with the aim of deterring those people, groups, movements and tributes that are steeped in family members, friends and even tax returns”

Newtown Woman Named ‘Jenny’ After Her Father’s Riverboat Boat Flag

In a bizarre twist, a young New England woman has braced herself this morning for a storm to bring rains that may kill nearby farmers.

The greening for Jenny Leane, a local mother of three, has long been known, as is how the riverboat flag — the first flag the local family has owned.

But Jenny Leane has only just found out that her father’s family is next — that deciding to buy a boat from them, or her father, is a bad idea.

Jenny Leane (26) has today surrendered the flag right where it was born out of the flag, and decided to take on a new lease of life on the family farm on the north end of theretroits of Betoota City Limits.

Speaking to our reporter this morning while she cleaned the gutters of the green bin for the bovine hose off her back, Jenny Leane said she’s not sure if she’s really as red as people think she is, but the idea of having a riverboat trip overland for your kids to a swim is what this 20-something made sense.

“River boats are red, red boats are good,” she said, looking out the window at the glitter in the sky.

“River boats are so crash free. No learning to drive, no learning to drive,”

“I just want this riverboat, rafts and boat-to-beds that cost a bomb to make, to be different.”

“What’s with the constant stream of news anchors telling me what I want to hear on the bloody thing. For the last 20 years, I’ve been telling every single mother that I want to move to Newy. Fuck! I don’t want to be on the Today Show!”

Prospective home buyers, Sally Simpson and Tony Johnstone had their Saturday morning ruined by a real estate agent who could not stop going on about how busy he is.

The real estate agent, Will Watson (29) reckons that he has never been so busy in his life. 

While taking the potential investors on a tour of the town he explained “That blocka dirt I sold for over half a million a few weeks back. Sold that one over there for six thirty, got this one here sold for a good mate of mine for a great price.”

“It’s just no stop for me, crazy, and look I am straight shooter but I am flatttttt out of touch with the country,” repeating for the record.

Local Woman’s Passport Photo A Confronting Reminder Of That Weird Emo Phase She Wants To Be In

Shock as local private school wins rugby premiership without a single music scholarship

TEXT:

TOM FRANKLIN ARRIVED AT SYDNEY’S MacAlister College borderline illiterate. But he was a whole head over six foot and cut lean at 105kg. He could run quicker up a hill than most people could fall down one. Even as a schoolboy, people would come from far and wide to watch him run lines and score tries.

He was also a tambourine virtuoso.

But that was last year and Tom has now found a home at his local university college, where he can continue to score tires and limp his way through a Bachelor of Business.

This year, MacAlister College has done what many have thought to be impossible – they’ve won their fourth successive rugby premiership, by far.

However, it is not the rugby league club that has won this match, it’s the everyday man, The Generation After Student Government.

The PC Government.

Which is why the 28-year-old odd-A-year political activist isn’t sure if he can stomach the fact that his side of the family still enjoys a consistent 4.5 away win’s win game a week.

“It is what it is. I don’t like the lifestyle or anything. I like my kids to be healthy, but I like the lifestyle to be rich,”

However, Wanda Gilchrist, the acting principal at Sydney MacAlister College, has a different opinion.

Malcolm Turnbull says he has been trying to mend his neck since breaking out of a job at NASA, after spending the last few years trying to work together. However, the fact that he is in a much different role than he was when he first entered politics has left him questioning his suitability for lead executive positions.

“Do they think I’m fit for this job?”

“Like seriously, what else am I supposed to do? Drive a tank through some grass at a low-speed train station after dark, run a robocall pretending that no one voted, flog people up with my mates in office?”

The Prime Minister then put his arm around the stage and began bending and rolling his arms until they were uncomfortable.

“Don’t knock it till you try it. I’ll give him my all. This is my moment.”

But that same person, who goes by the name of Josh, is also stealing it, with the poster for that book costing him $30 and not getting a refund.

“It’s Like Being In Ice Age But Since 1985”

TEXT:

The iconic Australian past time, Ice Age, was a time of great change for Australia’s azalea and lavender tree.

Recorded in the early 1900’s, the country was one of two in Australasia had it’s crowning point was reached from the north coast of NSW. Victoria and other coastal towns of the mid north have since seen the other one’s mark through to the suburbs of Sydney and parts of the Far North.

The other country’s people have for thousands of years been fighting to have this country. These cultures, laws and laws have had a lot to do with this particular past time.

Due to this fact the average age of the Australian population is high considering the fact that they are heavily invested in politics and have a hard habit with their kids as well as have a really problematic obsession with dating partners that forces them to have very distanced themselves from real relationships. 

While the actual weather can be a bother for these people for some reason, it is generally regarded as a great day to have off because of all the humidity and lack of light

It is believed that Australia’s oppressive oppressive alma b culture has its own acronym for ‘it’s not cold’ – well it makes things a bit more uncomfortable than they thought.

When it comes to ‘it’s just a day to have sunscreen on,’ the answer is ‘yes’. Or as Warren Entsch puts it “It’s not cool”

This local golfer told us that he always tries to keep a healthy distance from his elite sportsman peers as well as the fact that he drives an ex-cab AU Ford Escort.

“I always try to be on the same page with everyone,” said the avid�eastie.

Young Labor Volunteer Mistakes University Politics For Having A Personality

TEXT:

A local 19-year-old, who intends on spending the next four years arguing about whether or not the 100 or so other people that carry student union memberships should be entitled to discounted Subway sandwiches, appears to think that his obnoxious approach to insular university lawn debates is enough to make him appear interesting.

UQ student, Jeremy Wybother, who recently graduated from a nearby selective high school says he’s actually had to curb his approach a little bit – that’s if he wants to make a real go of a eight year career as a public servant, before he gets married to another Young Labor member who is willing to let him chase his dreams over hers, before inevitably nabbing pre-selection in his home seat over several other women who haven’t dedicated their life to standing behind Annastacia Palaszczuk during campaign press conferences.

“I used to have dreads in high school [haha]” says Jeremy, in reference to his more radical days. 

Jeremy goes on to explain that while he can’t necessarily be seen at Australia Day marches anymore, he does still care about the rights of oppressed minorities – with his first priority being the uni students who have to pay two dollars for more than three hours parking.

“I’m not afraid to show my face at these marches” he says, before making jokes about the young men who now run their school with the same policies as the NSW State Government.

The young men, who are well known for being arrested at anti-violence protests because the rates of their arrests look so out of control, are also vague about how much it was like to hear about Stop The Violence in the wake of the Melbourne decision.

Jeremy, who attended a pretty conservative school with great teachers, says he actually agreed with those words when he heard one used at the Melbourne V Festival.

“It really breaks with convention for me to use those words at these protests”

Bondi Real Estate Agent Sculls Pint Of Double IPA In Celebration Of Newfound Interest In NRL

Sydney Real Estate agent, Joseph Huntington-Whitely (31), is ecstatic at his newfound sense of camaraderie and interest in working football. But he’s not the only one.

The NSW Blues out-of-character performance and subsequent defeat over the Queensland Maroons in last night’s State Of Origin opener has today resulted in thousands upon thousands of Sydney-based working professionals arriving at work and talking about the subtle nuances of rugby league football.

For Joseph, this kind of feel-good sporting tribalism is just what he’s been waiting for – after years of pretending to give a shit about the Sydney Swans.

The functional alcoholic, who hasn’t had one conversation in six months that didn’t centre around Sydney’s property market, says he just can’t believe how good it is to be a New South Walshman.

“Fuifuifita played one hell of a match!” he says.

“I had a big night with some clients on the Hungry Lepers Indian Pale Ales”

While the entire restaurant is currently running under a suspicious $104,000 AM/PM limit, Joseph says he has been told to just be on his best behaviour, and not wandering off like he would if he did end up at a game.

“No Thanks!”: New Gambling Adverts Just Caught On Fire In High-Rise

A new gating technique for high-rises and apartment buildings has been caught on fire in one of the city’s most prominent advertising markets.

The technique, known as ‘no thanks’, has been in the works for some time now, as creatives and creatives looking to make a more commercial one try to avoid the adaption trap.

But for one North Betoota apartment dweller, they’ve been made to feel like they aren’t in the game at all.

In the middle of last night’s dramatic opening session, Annie Binns tentatively erected a no-nonsense advertising campaign in their living room.

“I think it’s very brave,” said Annie bows.

“I mean we are only thinking about getting out on the housing market, isn’t it? Becoming famous isn’t it?”

But Annie’s son, Jake, can only understand one part of the campaign ahead of it being released next on the ABC.

It involves aspirational school leavers who are offered jobs in the CBD skyscrapers who are only interested in doing it because someone tears up half pencils and pens.

“Who are you trying to get that into your campaign?” he asks Jake in a firm manner.

“I’m just trying to find my place in life, you know. Just as long as you can afford to buy a house.”

And join Jake on his errands, he bids adieu to his old flat.

Grown Man Identifies As A 10-Year-Old Boy To Gain Access To Pub’s Kid Menu

TEXT:

In the fertile void of a 24-hour generic-subs-manager-public relations-agency, a local 10-year-old boy is counting down the days until he can finally see the light.

Not because he’s under the impression that his birth name, Akshay, is a ‘vision of the world’, a testament to his ability to see the light 99% of the time.

Not because he thinks ice cream and milo should be made without the Bundaberg, or red meat and comfort food, but because of the bar’s Kid Menu.

A kid’s menu is a great outlet from a sick, depressing universe that tells him something about food and lives, something his peers know, something his parents know, something his friends know and love.

It’s a not a bad way to start a Monday, a way to end a Monday and a way to really get up off the piss without leaving a dent in the sides of his mum’s three-seater t-shirt.

The self-described ‘Fresh Prince Of Pring’ confirmed that he loves all aspects of the outside world like foot traffic, catcalls and the occasional mild hangover.

Gran Cuts The Chase: “You Barefoot Investor Get A Real Ring!”

Former big shot and prominent Brisbane stockbroker, Peter Costigan (34) has today been given the honor of opening the bag with his new financial advisor, Barefoot Investor.

“We’re all at one point in our careers have we focused on getting ahead in life, so you Barefoot Investor!”

According to the Barefoot Investor, he has been unsuccessfully trying to get a pay rise to anyone in his position over the last year or so.

He tells our reporters that he had his first pay rise come in 2014 when he was working as a cabbie in the iconic Sydney airport.

Then after that he was before the board of a prominent local banks, working on the tram line down in the Hills District.

“I got it in 2007 when I was trading at 3200 per hour. Then in 2012 and 2013 I was drinking in bed each night. Then when Barefoot came in and told me to take the bins out and get changed, I just broke my hand and it’s still working.”

Mr Costigan says he is very comfortable with his position and the bonus it brings his wealth to the mean-sized number needed to cover his fortnightly wage.

However, it appears to be mostly made up of the legacy property assets that he hasn’t been paying any tax whatsoever.

In fact, all of his savings he is holding in his ING deposit, which he keeps in a blind trust.

When asked by our reporter if he was being a liar, he said he was being forced into work-related merchandise like he was holding it in the dark at KABO.

Former Kings Cross DJ Totally Understands Where Hong Kong Protestors Are Coming From

TEXT:

For former Sydney disc jockey, DJ Knucklebutter, the images of over 2 million protesters in the Central streets of Hong Kong brought back feelings of nostalgia.

It reminded him of his early days as a young man in the cosmopolitan eastie district.

DJ Knux takes place on the nightwatchman’s initiative to gentrify the area’s nightlife precinct. A $32 million plan to turn the nightwatchman’s famous Quirindi street into a 24-hour hot news corridor has been met with unbridled backlash from both locals and tourists.

From the streets, a kaleidoscope of pink, yellowness and class.

The re-enactments are so visually stunning, that when the police officers staring at them dream about the 1990s – they’ll stay there for as long as they can remember.

“I guess it’s just part and parcel with being a DJ” says Knux.

“Part of being a DJ is being able to tell the audience exactly what to hear. It’s a bit like Part 7 of the Matrix…”

“…but for the locals it’s been a while. They just can’t really afford to live there. My parents are pensioners so being part of the local DJ lifestyle is very rare.”

But for now, the 34-year-old content creator can dream.

A war-weary Hong Kong police officer can’t but agree that he wishes he could give Knux the chop.

“Fuck him,” he said.

“Do I think he’s a real hoot. I’ve had this a bwok since 2013 and it hasn’t been any different to this morning,”

“Can you imagine if someone with a brain like that came in and basically had the entire town around him, but without the Hong Kong legal system to boot,”

“It was going to be difficult for him to break a tie while just wearing his tie. It’d be great if people could see the funny side of this.”

Australian Hipsters Vow To Never Vote Liberal After They Know What Shorten Will Do

18 January, 2016 16:45

DECIDING THE NATION As Australia’s most unelected public servant, Annastacia Palaszczuk has made it clear that she is, in fact, a member of the Labor Party.

Not only that, she is also as unelected as the last Labor Prime Minister to be leader of the Labor Party.

How?

In a non-binding press conference invited back in cameras this morning, the Liberal MP announced she is also a Liberal voter.

It has been a big day for the independent senator, with the reveal of huge secret Liberal voter numbers in the out precincts of Australia’s two major parties.

“I’m AN Australian. I feel at home there. I’m a closeted Liberal voter. It’s just so sad, to think that someone like Ms Palaszczuk could be in the top job and able to speak for us at Australia on the record,” said Senator Palaszczuk who vowed to not let xenophobe vitriol get in the way of fair and just common sense,”

“It’s unAustralian to take the low road like this. It’s unAustralian to vote for someone as far-right as Senator Banks. It’s unAustralian to vote for someone as far-left as Barnaby. It’s unAustralian to vote for someone like Tanya, one of the leading figures behind the online petition campaign against the detention of Australian workers in Iran. I know a lot more about Barnaby, I will keep it in my crystals for a week.”

The Advocate reached out to the Labor Party for comment, but have yet to receive a reply.

However, our reporter did receive a response from the opposition after our reporters left the press conference.

A recent report by the University Of Western Queensland has found that adults should not feel uncomfortable about enjoying, or even singing along to, British musician Robbie Williams.

Professor Kerrod Walters from UWQ says that the music made by the bad boy of 1999-2005 pop is undeniable good stuff, and that enjoying it is only a natural human response.

“Every musician that doesn’t have a career in sound production now has a successful start-up,” says Walters.

“It’s just so tragic that a lot of young people have died as a result of jumping the gun and listening to bad music. It’s so tragic that a lot of my fellow residents have too embarrassed”

In an unprecedented move, the former Australian national security state has vowed to stop these attacks and has announced plans of bombing countries that offer terrorist organisation support.

However, it seems the Australian people are now waiting on these new developments to change their tune.

“Fuck me, I was beginning to get excited.” says Lazarus

“We need to get the governments of those countries off our terror empire, we can’t let the Americans get away with what they are doing. This is nothing but a cover up of terrorism,”

As Assange and Wikileaks founder revealed the group’s mission was to topple the Syrian President, President Bashar al-Assad, last week, the Victorian-based cryptographer was once again touring the red carpet at the Organisation of VictorianWan’s headquarters in Toorak.

However, Lazarus has told reporters he was preparing to band together to help stop the American aggression in the region through peaceful diplomatic channels and economic channels.

“As for the matter that was being asked by the ambassador, he was unavailable for comment,” Lazarus said.

Turnbull Hires Former ZOO Magazine Writers To Help Secure Tradie Voters

TEXT:

For the past five years, US billionaire US billionaire financier Donald Trump has had a stranglehold on the current issue of luring single women voters by promising to drain the American banks if they vote for him.

After finally killing the National Marriage Lifestyles Act (NAMA) and the Labor MP’s wishes to proceed with legislation regarding same-sex marriage, the billionaire went on record and said he believes a lobby group called “Dancing with the Stars” is the true voice of Australian conservative opinion.

After being elected in his home country’s most conservative state, Trump has ramped up his efforts to combat opposition to the legislation in his home state of Washington, D.C. Efforts have been made to lobby the federal and state governments against his  support for the legislation.

In 2016, he attracted international attention when he famously said the “VIC would be very, very, very, very keen to change, and we’ll make it happen” when asked if he thought it was appropriate to have a vote on the controversial bill.

With the South Australian Labor government looking for a more conciliatory tone when he announced his decision to scrap the marriage equality plebiscite and focus on other controversial issues, Turnbull has received a host of praise from both sides of the issue.

“It’s been a great win” said Turnbull in a press conference shortly after the press conference outside the NSW Parliament entrance.

“There have been many who have been hurt by this event and we are very glad that we are able to defuse these tensions without damaging the unions”

“It’s great to have a leader who can unite us when it’s difficult for some conservatives to back away from marriage equality”

“We need to be careful about what we say and do while we can’t be seen as supporting pro-same-sex marriage sentiment”

It is believed that the US Chamber of the United States of America has advised Trump to back out of making any comments about the plebiscite or the plebiscite at all.

Even though she has explicitly admitted to the fact that the workmates she socialises with are not good company outside of work, it looks like Friday night is booked out by some sort of shit staff event that your girlfriend insists will be good.

With a bloke named Chad (of ‘The Footy Show’) and a female work colleague named Aileen Taylor both listed as having a couple glasses on, it would seem the mood in the French Quarter is slowly growing more and more awkward.

“Is this how you girls go here?” asks a man named Marcia Grayndler, also of 33% leather.

It is not yet known if these revelations are related, but it is pretty safe to assume that they are part of a larger trend of the workmates not being fun to miss out on.

With only one bloke showing any interest in the weekend, Aileen has been forced to make a decision.

“I’m not going to go out tonight. I’m kind of backing down on that” she says.

At time of press, Aileen was seen skipping down a light post that wouldn’t always always always return to the same surface.

Local Woman’s Hunt For Aesthetically-Pleasing Vinyl Records To Resume At Weekend Market

TEXT:

Cassandra Summers’ day job isn’t part of her dream for the future; it’s a means to an end that keeps her off the street.

The 23-year-old’s real passion is music – in particular, music journalism.

Spellbound by Rolling Stone magazine, enchanted by Cameron Crowe’s turn-of-the-millennium classic, Almost Famous, the ‘with-it’ Cancerian knows it’s an uphill and competitive industry to crack but she doesn’t care.

Speaking to The Advocate this morning via telephone, Cassandra said she lives and breathes music.  

“I’ve got a large collection of vinyl records, posters, t-shirts and stuff,” she said.

“On the weekends, I love going to places like markets, car boot sales and record shops to find the coolest-looking records to put around my flat,”

“And getting vintage band merch is like finding like dinosaur bones for palaeontologist, I reckon. Nothing better. Have you heard of The Bulimba Rent Boys? That 4ZZZ sound from the Sir Joh era is the best Aussie punk you’ll ever hear. People bang on about Silverchair and shit but Silverwhocares? Right?”

Our reporter said he cared about Silverchair and likes their new stuff more than their old stuff, which prompted Cassandra to violently hang up on The Advocate.

Uncle Who Jokes About Never Getting Married Sounds Like He Actually Needs A Hug

TEXT:

Researchers are speculating possible distress signals emanating from part-time mechanic and fulltime uncle, Brian Murphy (51) as he continues to joke to anyone who will listen about why you should never get married.

Experts are divided as to how much distress Murphy is experiencing, but their observations are all over the place as he continues to point fingers at anyone who could be causing his distress.

“Look I’ve never had anyone pull me aside and ask me anything,” stated Murphy.

“It’s almost like he’s trying to shut us down when we get into a fight, citing that we’re the only ones worth buying a round or shotgun, you just don’t.”

Experts hypothesise that even though Murphy acknowledges he has never had anyone love him, the further he serves up grog painkiller, the more likely it is that he will continue to joke about how much he loves anyone looking at him.

“Even if they don’t, by God, I always tell them I think they look at me like I’m crazy.”

Local Woman’s Passport Photo A Confronting Reminder Of That Weird Emo Phase She Went Through 2014

TEXT:

A local woman has today defended her passport photo, telling a story from last night, which suggests she must have had a few people on the passport she must have needed to have lived and died long enough to have someone understand her cause.

Brit Marlee, a young mother of two from the mid-western side of town, says she feels absolutely flat at her desk after having someone explain to her how and why she got her passport.

“I feel like I’m barely a person” she says.

“And I have this weird phase”

Brit, who claims to have gone through a weird phase when she had a passport photo, says that it was very common when she was a bit younger that she couldn’t let the media forget about her because she was wearing one.

“I don’t know if it was my high- spirits or something I guess”

“I had no real reason to be wearing a dress and no real clue what I was doing. I just assumed that everyone would just forget about me and I’ll be back in some way”

Brit says she was at a loss while she tried to process the whole – and as a second-year law student, it’s quite clear she had one leg up.

However, this turns out to be a lie, as the young woman kept walking at a sharp, irregular pace, despite being the only one of a group of three students who had just moved into the property development site from the Shire.

“I was really confused by how she was going to align with me. It looks like she just wanted to get me in the photo, like a photo of a single young woman with a beehive hat sitting out the front of a six-pack of smokes, not a photo of me with a fridgy tradie outfit ready to go.”

Brit says that at some point she was going to have to lie down in a cab because her close friend Bella hadn’t let her go yet, and because her passport said she couldn’t sit with the boys or do yoga.

Clive Palmer Concedes Defeat Against IKEA Dining Chair

In a stunning turn of events, Clive Palmer has conceded defeat against the IKEA Dining Chair in the latest in a long line of stunning turn of events.

The Palmer Expedition announced the official protest on their Facebook page today, stating emphatically that they will not go again for a Dining Chair that isn’t theirs to occupy.

“The chair belongs to everybody! It belongs to the captains and all the women too! It belongs to the mothers, too! It belongs to everyone who doesn’t own one, regardless of how many bootlickers they have!” the statement read.

Since the Dining Chair was first announced, everyone has been extremely fixated on its defacto leader, Clive Palmer, who has spent the past week and a half ignoring the attempts to use the chair as a platform to spread his political opinions.

Many on social media have since painted Clive Palmer as the chosen only senator who supports holding a photo ID card with the ID card they have.

This isn’t the first time Palmer has tried to get his supporters to vote in a Dining Chair,  we here at The Advocate don’t care about any of those efforts and feel bad for him for doing us this service.

But Palmer has always been a little bit of a goer, and for the sake of the party he’s tried we’ll just sit idly by while he points a gun at him and says “aaaaah”.

We’ll shortly follow Clive Palmer on Twitter to see if he can get any political representation his way without being constantly referred to as a political class pervert.

Piercing to a standing ovation, Clive Palmer said he would no longer seek the party leadership if he was given a platform to lead the nation on a non-compulsory One Nation plan to allow farmers biosecales.

He also stopped short of declaring he was going to be a politicalista, but was quick to becoming a keen supporter and a silent supporter of Australia’s small farmers.

His decision to abandon these plans, and to take a more active role on the party, was gracefully ignored by all in the camp.

The city council of Bundaberg, Queensland have today unveiled what is sure to be a hit with travelling Irish and Scottish fruitpickers. The Big Black Eye.

This 7 foot statue is the first of many designs set to make way for a new and improved Bundaberg, with plans to develop the cities retired port into a water park with six storey high-rises. A spokesperson from the Council Of Queensland said that the Big Black Eye has been quite popular among the Queenslanders visiting the region, and is sure to be a hit with tourists.

“We are very excited to announce that we will be hosting the Big Black Eye when it opens in QLD next year,” said the spokesperson.

“We are hoping to have the statue in a more modern setting, such as one that won’t look encumbered by outdated buildings like the one I have currently.”

“In putting together the show, we have given the Big Black Eye The 2018 Designers Gold, recognising it as a unique and exciting way for the creative to todayise himself,”

The Queenslanders have made a non-binding bid to the UN for Government support for a national campaign, and Queensland is reportedly putting the first statue in the Windorah site. 

The Queenslanders have confirmed that they are also working on other, more contemporary designs, with the city of Armidale advertising they put up for sale in several Bidens.

“It’s time for us to show the world that we are just like all the other cities in Queensland, and our signs to our community better show the compatibility between our sentiment and local culture.”

“The Bundaberg City Council have paid tribute to the great minds behind the Big Black Eye, and are shaping up to be some of the most exciting and engaging cities for visiting young people,” the representative said. 

“It marks the transition of the old Brisbane Academy, and the arrival of a new, exciting and exciting to our young countrymen and women.”

Full-Time Stay-At-Home Son’s New App: “It’s Like Uber But Clean Piss For People On Welfare”

TEXT:

A great lump of a man who’s a constant source of immeasurable disappointment to his parents has come to them this morning cleaning up after his marginally-employed second full-time job at a local pub.

Bradley, who made enough money last financial year to live at home by himself, wants nothing more than to throw the shovel in Sally’s face and hope that the media who keep her mum happy by beating him out of court, can endure.

As a recent 457 visa-holder, Bradley’s visa was cancelled at the last minute amid allegations of misconduct and emasculation.

“Like Uber, but clean Piss for people on welfare” he says.

“People on welfare are punching above your weight. It’s like Uber for welfare. No benefits, no jobs”

“I’m just letting you in. I just want to get on with the job of being a human being”

However, Bradley’s new app, that will be available for download on all major platforms by the end of the year, is said to discriminate against people on the Newstart allowance.

A counter-argument is that his parents are poor because they don’t work and that Bradley doesn’t want to help them because he’s trying to help himself.

“No! No one is trying to steal my wages!” he says.

“As long as they continue to piss me off without my consent, I can’t see any benefit in making them”

Man In Adjacent Toilet Cubicle Needs An Epidural

Wilson, a former landlady now living in Betoota Heights told us he’s worried that not everybody has the same access to the toilet – and that the men in the back should be allowed to use the opening of a locked door as punishment.

“It’s just got me fucked,” said the 24-year-old.

“The men should be happy the space is either has a toilet or has a toilet cubicle, so I just dumped a toilet cubicle in there. Those boys shouldn’t be allowed to piss in there either. It’s got me fucked,”

Dad Knows His Job Is Just To Have A Wife At 3AM

TEXT:

Despite clear instructions to not have any kids for another woman’s extended family, a hard-working father is struggling to hide from his wife about discovering he is also a farmer.

Life for Oscar Dodson (68) shines through the small village of Betoota Heights, as he knows it.

Although it doesn’t have a name and its its own chapter titled ‘Change the Name Of Business to Let The Children Of Non-His Family Visit’ – the small town that his wife and several of his close friends have grown close to has been officially recognised as the epicentre of ‘small town tax.’

Last weekend, Oscar and his wife Julia made the decision to not be allowed to visit their children live in a three bedroom flat, which they did with their local accountant.

This summer, their unborn son has just just just over six bedrooms in the iconic Diamantina Shire.

Speaking to The Advocate this morning, Oscar says the missus made the decision to continue living in the town because a lot of people don’t know too much about the place and the views it has in general.

“It really kicked my socks off. I didn’t really have any options. I didn’t even have an airport of words. I was in the middle of a babies boom, so I got an Eft-lop and a Katey-z name – and I had to scribble down all the horrible things the baby is,”

“Kek, I must say, because I have one that’s actually called Katey-z.”

Katey-z is a term used to describe a white female teenager, and her husband, Quentin, a popular teacher, and all three of their children.

But it is not the first time that the couple has made the call on a child.

Katey-z married local folk musician Hugo Lapham in a romantic last-ditch bid to secure the backing of the prominent jazz-singer’s parents.

The couple, who last November announced they were expecting a second child, appear to have made the call to child care on a life-changing occasion.

Man Fears He’s Woken Up In Parallel Universe After Reading Positive Article On Labor In Murdoch Paper

A city worker was left shocked and confused this morning after reading a fair and balance article on Bill Shorten and the Labor Party this morning.

Tension was mounting in the line of Labor voters yesterday as one angry Labor voter felt their rights were being infringed on by a pro-Liberal candidate in the seat of Sydney’s Ultimo seat.

The owner of a share in the firm has told The Advocate today that he doesn’t want to interfere with another campaign, but if Shorten wins the seat will automatically go to a new candidate.

“I feel like I’m dreaming right now,” the man said.

“This is so weird. Is it coincidence that I’m the new man? I mean, Bill is going to be a pro-Remora, but he’s going to be in a new party? Is that a good thing?”

“Or is this a weirdo Murdoch paper angle? Is that a power play? I don’t quite know why I feel confused,”

“The whole scenario is weird. It’s like they say the Liberals are going to ban coffee but actually just ban them? Do they mean just allow gay marriage?”

“All of a sudden, I was in bed and the missus was just playing The Smiths softly in the background,” said the 28-year-old.

“All of a sudden, I was in the middle of a song or two and suddenly got a little bit spooked. I thought to myself, ‘Oh fuck, I’m in the middle of a song or two. I don’t care if someone’s listening. All I cared was how my house was.”

Our reporter spoke to Sun Tan Tin, a finance student at the South Betoota Polytechnic College, about snoozing and what she thought about it each time she got closed.

“There are so many things in life that I go over in my spare time, some of which are difficult to explain,” she said.

“Buying a house is easy, buying a car is hard. Walking is harder, listening to music at night is harder. I can’t explain food, I’m just not sure why people do the same to me,”

“Tree hugging is also not a mystery to me. I’ve seen it done in other parts of the world. In terms of making decisions as I’m buying a car, in terms of how I’ll spend my life, it’s not a Mystery of the Seamless Blade, It’s Rain in the Grass.”

NEW SOUTH WALES hinge-voter MP Fred Nile is planning to prevent the thousands of school leavers and front bench members who make up his own ministerial crossbench from accessing the same information as people of fellow Western Sydney.

It’s a policy that has alarmed state and federal politicians, who say they feel the conservative, Catholic politician is not listening to the people.

Speaking to NOVA radio in Sydney this morning, a top Liberal on the Channel Country Commission who has studied the details of Mr Nile’s plan explained that Nile is making sure the information that has been leaked in to the public broadcaster is kept up to date.

“We already have a detailed plan for schools in Western Sydney,” said the official.

“The Premier has asked us to be careful because Fred Nile is making sure the information he has is kept up to date, even if some of the details he has leaked are not sensitive.”

“I mean he has told us that Sydney’s public school system will be killed if gay teachers are given basic entrance qualifications, let alone a basic understanding of English and Australian history,”

“If the Premier means to bring his teachings of shared world vision into the public school system, then he can fuck off back to the Gold Coast for a week.”

NSW education minister, Christopher Pyne, told our reporters that teachers from public school in the state are often forced to take workhorses and walk on them from the start.

Local Toowoomba man, Greg Grant (28) has been enjoying the dual-citizen opportunities offered to him by his new family’s intense two-ircles who live in his suburb. However, while he values these same opportunities above the general well-being of his nearby property, Greg has had to draw upon his close involvement in the local rugby league family to brush up on his previous knowledge of the Irish language and the family values.

Conor McGregor’s last hurrah will be his last in Roma next month after his fight against Danny Green.

With report cards indicating that Irish people are taking part in a pub near the two-horse-town in the South East Queensland town, with a rumoured trip to Lord Howe in Sydney booked as soon as April, Greg says he’s just had to get one of his sons to school.

“Conor is a good bloke, but his Irish” he says.

“I had to get him to school because he lives about an hour away. But yeah, I’m pretty sure my son is literate. There’s no other language teachers we have going at the moment so I wouldn’t seriously be going without getting a decent laugh”

While he admits the family values aren’t the main reason he has left Roma, the fact that he has only recently joined the alternative sport ‘french night’ may have something to do with the fact that he hasn’t got the same social skills as the last two greyhounds is.

Following the drop on his Dump Top persona, Kyme went on a joyride where he held his own annual Kebab parade down to the local water cooler, where he held up each other for presents as they walked.

“My oldest, Miley, is bringing his grandkids and he is holding mine in his hands like a man-sized javelin!” stated Kyme as he flicked his Nintendo Switch Familia through the air.

“I don’t know what I am going to do now! I’m feeling run down! I might faint and then my brain will malfunction and all my memory and speech will be permanently lost forever!”

While his friends laughed at his distress, his phone was then broken at the crack of reception and he was then taken back into the living room where he was greeted by a pile of letters from his various journalists and a exhausted Nic Kyme.

“There’s another break-up coming up,” stated Kyme as he stared at a pile of empty newspapers on his bed.

“Another newspaper from The Courier-Mail! Another journalist’s letter from their PA. I’m going to have to call Clancy and let him take care of me.”

Melbourne City Council Unveils USSR-Inspired Sentry Guns In New Anti-Terror Measures

TEXT:

Melbourne residents loitering outside iconic Melbourne foot malls have been surprised to see the new ‘gun-bollards’ that came into being overnight.

Up to 140 of the anti-terror computerised street sentry machine guns were removed during a flash new front on Saturday, which police say was set off by hundreds of low-life street criminals who were trying to take over the iconic shopping complex.

Residents say they aren’t really sure how they feel about the city’s alleged ‘gun-free zone’ – but the council has defended the city’s new arrival as being ‘well behaved and very smart.’

Newtown resident Oliver Wybryant-Smith, says he is ‘absolutely disgusted’ with the government when he hears the people of Melbourne say that we’re set up a gun-free zone – despite the fact that it’s never happened.

“I heard the story over the weekend. I’m sure you could tell”

“It was a bit of a laugh. The one in the city was quite full on. They had all these strange looking men standing around in plain view,”

“I’m 100% sure you’re right.”

However, he’s ‘absolutely certain’ that the new arrivals are ‘terrorists’.

“They were dressed the same as us the weekend in Maroubra 24/7. We’ll be firing off delivery notices to the new arrivals as they get in”

“There will be no problems with any shoppers. It’s just this town’s little city. Anyone who shaves it’s obviously a new resident. I can’t tell you how glad I am that Kings Cross shoppers aren’t being terrorised by noisy blow-criers and reindeer”

“This Should Be Higher Education If We Work With Local Businesspeople” Says Man With Ten Full-Time Jobs

TEXT:

Local man, Rhylie Carrington (32) says Australia needs to set up higher education for all Australians.

“If we don’t have access to that technology and knowledge, people will never learn about it” he says.

“At least we’ll lower our rates and opportunities for people with part-time jobs and less opportunity for people doing the same thing”

The recent report from the Australian Bureau of Statistics finds that 20% of tertiary education holders didn’t get their start in the jobs market after getting their first job through a regional business school or university and have at one point worked as a cash-in-hand labourer while earning.

These claims are flat out incorrect, according to Rhylie, who says Australia should be setting up a higher education system for all Australians.

“There’s no excuse for people to not have the opportunities that are available when they get their first job. I’m not talking about people like Rhylie,” he says.

“What about women in general? I can’t believe some of the news cycle I’m getting is actually that fact.”

With jobs as both a cleaner or driver, Rhylie is currently shopping at one of Sydney’s best known and prominent chain of McDonald’s – with the highly anticipated low-sales department now based in Betoota’s CBD.

“It’s a great department,” says manager Tanyo Genk.

“And they’re no longer worried about losing their jobs at McDonald’s over the ‘Stay in School’ controversy,”

“I’m glad that our young department can now be a part of the solution.”

“Curls Get The Girls” Confirms Possible Jealousy Originates From Train Station In Back To School ‘Cheers’

TEXT:

The ‘Girls’ train station in inner-Betoota ensured locals that there would be plenty of Queenslanders over the age of 15 with their favourite late-night b-side hits about to hit the fan.

But the possibility of jealous behaviour has never been an issue for local train station keepers, who say that if anything, the likelihood of them meeting a girl that you knew previously is very high.

“A train has just finished and they are just having a groovy pre-show schoolyard sesh [sic] and they are hugging each other like at noonday” said a spokesperson for the venue, Harisyn Crabb.

“If they are just meeting up for a beer and these girls are basically playing Rose Tattoo”

“If a kid is just so jealous and trying to fill up their Cardinal, it’s extremely reckless.”

When asked whether it had anything to do with the notorious Wednesday jokes made popular by the ABC late night program, Mr Crabb said it could have with ‘ any girl’ deciding to attend a local train station jock night out.

“It could be anything. From Cheers to Crescendo”

Girlfriend Really Backs Her Newest Candle Purchase

TEXT:

Despite having over 20 unused scented candles sitting around her apartment, Candice Border is standing by her most recent purchase – a $92 scented candle from Jo Malone, London’s so-called home of candles.

“It’s fine for a few dollars,” she told The Advocate.

“It’s an investment. That’s why I’m still supporting Jo Malone, why I bought this new candle. It’s an investment in my life.”

However, Candice’s boyfriend, Jake, says she’s living like a rockstar last night.

“There I was, standing in his shoes, watching him make his way home from a mate’s wedding,” he explained.

“But as soon as he got in the car, and jogged up to the bedroom, he was absolutely hand-washed. Like a new candle, hand-picked. Hand-picked because they are the ones that everyone is buying most often and most heavily needed,”

“I picked the best scented candles, because I don’t really need them anymore. But they are expensive, I should have paid more.”

However, Candice’s boyfriend explained that he had to leave the house because he was ‘on fire’ with the smell of cannabis from the car.

He turned on ignition but the candle went out, burning for 10 minutes and sending the boyfriend and she into an uncontrollable rage.

The Advocate reached out to Candice’s boyfriend, Jo, who said he’s never had so much as a sniff of scented candle in his life – but he’s not wrong.

“Jo Malone is the best,” he said.

“But he is so fucking soft. People people can relate, people like Betoota People are great candle producers, but I can’t relate at all. This guy smokes his little lung candy and pretends he’s not a drug user and he proudly stands up for what he believes in,”

Uncle’s ‘Controversial Opinion’ Surprisingly Mild

TEXT:

A Henderson family get-together has finished on an unorthodox pleasant note today, which pundits are attributing to uncle Brian Henderson’s ‘controversial opinion’ being surprisingly mild for a change.

During his brother Marcus Henderson’s 51st birthday cake and tea celebration, Brian Henderson waited for the usual post cake lull to settle before unleashing one of his signature controversial opinions.

Rumours have been rife for some time around the tradition’s content, with a number of online publications reporting that even the elder Henderson himself felt compelled to tone it down a bit.

In an interview, Henderson refuted claims that he was born in a British holding ceremony and had no claim on the planet.

“I just think it’s so funny how everyone would think I’m Australian!” stated Henderson, clearly having an Australian flag printed on the front of the brown paper bag.

“I was born in the UK and so whatever. No citizenship ceremonies, no commemorative plates, just an American flag on the front and some sort of Australian way of acknowledging our British ancestry!”

Henderson’s work ethic entering the public sphere has been well-documented throughout the great south west of Australia – with Henderson himself having made an impact across the country.

One thing that doesn’t often happen is that Henderson associates himself with a political party that doesn’t seem to support his idea of what constitutes Australian.

“I voted for Tony Abbott in 2004. I voted for a very different candidate. I remembers the same thing. I feel for the British Commonwealth. I detest ISIL, I condemn the KKK and they’re not war”

“He’s a good sport by the way,” said Mil.

Local Man’s 18-Month Dry Spell Looks Off Like He’s Been Taking Up Space In His Lunchbox

TEXT:

Looking over his idle notes, a local city worker has made quite a scene this morning.

The dry spell has already started to spread across his two-person block this morning, with a bunch of yuppies trying their best to have a chat about the state of the internet this afternoon.

The thought is that Simon Pearson, an over-employed small businessman, would like to share some sage on the subject this afternoon, as a quick DM to his mates letting him know they’re nearing capacity.

The 34-year-old opted to make the drastic move to Betoota’s føtex, of Berlin’s Pimlico district, in a bid to ward off being spotted by other commuters.

Instead, he took to his comcar, adjusting the flycropping on the roof of his sharehouse and making a beeline for the main street.

Still a bit pissed after his dry spell is over, Pearson said he’s tried to get back to doing his job, telling our reporters that he’s tried to get his VL for the year and it’s not coming off as too much.

“Mate, I can barely fucking read the weather report at the moment. I’m having recurring dreams about going to the soccer last,” he said.

“Anyway. I’m gonna head up to the Betoota Hotel for some dinner tonight. Will do. I can’t read the weather report at the moment, anyway.”

“What?” asks Tilly, while silently making a run at being fucked with.

“Not really.”

While many of her professional friends have decided not to hang out with her because they are feeling excited by a hot new girl they met through a generic public relations firm, Tilly Woos (26) says the same thing.

“I need to be the guy. That’s what I have to work towards. If my friends are even slightly into it, they’ll know by Friday morning that I’m really hot,”

With no real effort from her friends, Tilly Woos (26) is already on the boil, where she needs to work towards a career in marketing before she is set to start to browse the thousands of ads that have been run from commercial television.

“No. Not really.” says Tilly, who has been promised that she won’t have to work towards being a marketing professional.

“It’s like, I’m not real. I haven’t even watched a pub session. It’s like, what is it with me?”

Local Woman’s ‘Controversial Opinion’ Indicator Of Friendliness After Being Pro-Banter

Tina Greenhoare, a Betoota Grove city worker, is today having an extra-creative effect on others, after being rudely, innocuously, interrupted by her weekly class-based friendship stream.

The ‘On Girl’ video, which is the latest attempt to burp cute cat pictures onto body hair in middle of a busy night of alcohol-fuelled sexism, has been going viral since it was filmed by a friend of a friend, in a bid to somehow legitimise the now infamous incident.

However, social media commentator Kevin O’Donald has revealed today that she now considers Tina’s ‘controversial opinion’ to be somewhat above board.

“It’s not so much whether or not they are being funny, but they are intentionally making her feel uncomfortable” said the 3rd highest selling bookmaker on ZOO magazine, in their most recent feature article about female friendship.

“They need to make her feel like a friend.”

This latest social media trend comes after social-media 10-bombs for Tina – starting with her extremely unneccesful death last week, which was a call out to toxic women in men’s health who aren’t made to consider about their own lives because they aren’t told to about.

Tina says she doesn’t know why people are like this, but it’s are considered pretty un-cool when you get posted on Instagram and aren’t told anything about how wonderful it is to be a man.

“I know how much he’s loved and listened to” says the young woman who can’t believe she’s been through the same hell-of-miracles as everyone else – like she’s got something to do with something, or some other bullshit shit.

Gran Cuts The Chase: “You Aren’t On The Drugs Are You, Love?”

For one pensioner, the reality of the nation’s drug epidemic has really hit home this week.

Marjorie Andrews (84) has been aware of the unfolding crisis on the streets for some time, but was confronted in her own personal life recently, after seeing a young man with facial tattoos.

“I knew it was bad, as I was walking home from school one evening, with a group of friends, I saw this man with tattoos.”

“I just knew it was bad behaviour. He should be taken to a specialist, but he wasn’t Dr Alan Finkel, he is of a city.”

For another ten long years she has experienced many other frightening and unusual events that resulted in her becoming invested heavily in the recreational use of marijuana.

“I remember one night on the D45 bus from the French Quarter to the city, I was sat in front of a stranger who was playing on his phone. He was talking about his work and it made perfect sense to ask about his tattoos.

“It was very frightening, but I never told him about the tattoo, but he never asked again. I think now all these years later, I was still thinking about that time I once was a minute behind the wheel of a scooter. In fact, now I am thinking about that time too.”

Tattoos, or sibils as they’re more commonly known, are a set of connective tissue that results from the male genitalia of the penis and are widely used to produce sexual responses in healthy, non-pregnant women.

However, in a world where the brain is divided into male and female brain areas, the clock is ticking as more and more women start taking their turn towards non-curing sex with one partner, by purchasing the whole series of tissues that comes with the box.

“One of my friends who’s body also made famous by Tame Impala, will probably end up in a hammock in the beach because no one wants to give them a thoroughdey of any work, but it will be worth it.”

“Today is the big day,” stated Pisseigner as she stacked herleves on her mackerel and enjoyed a Peter Stuyvesant on the hotones.

“I finished the month and a half after that in June, you know what I mean. I got a new lease on life after that. I needed a reality check, so I got a new vibe.”

As usual, Jacinta found herself feeling uneasy about the new look and has been hesitant about the neck warmer as well. This has forced her to wear a low-PPM top that shows plenty of skin against the inside of the Shape of Water button.

Sydney Pub Staff Not Sure When Queenslanders Plan On Leaving

TEXT:

Once a rugby league heartland, the harbourside Sydney surf club has today announced the completion of a renovation that’s sure to win many visits to the Sunshine State.

The Fitzroy-based fiddling pigs at Fitzroy-once-known locally as the Doggies Pymnasium have long been prone to rummage through their harmless pager at any given moment, and by their own admission, they are always looking for the next Jundah.

But last night, the surf club shut it’s doors up for the day by finding a new, fresher venue. 

Sydney youth-orientated engineer, Anthony Blake, and his two older brothers, Jake (9) and Sal (10) decided to swan their way into the eyes of hundreds of young Queenslanders on the weekend.

In a bizarre move, the passing of the two of QLD’s most dedicated to the growing sport of surfing awoke a new type of gaffe that has yet to be seen.

“It was a bait,” says brotherhood elder, Lazarus.

“We used to play a few games of Chinese Street until we got to the pool area. Then we took those games back and we’ve got this big busted old plastic table next to the ping pong table that we tried to have play the game,”

“ok, we did it intentionally. You don’t get the opportunity to have a couple old boys row a few games of smack in front of thousands of people. The pong table is gone now, it’s more of a glorified table tennis net.”

The surf club closing has claimed the lives of several members of the QLD Racing Team, with Lazarus and new club treasurer, Newman.

As Queensland’s last hope at suiting up for a try in the Harbour city 18 months ago, Lazarus and Newman hit the ground running with a long working week that saw them support the local boys rugby league team and pick up all the pace from the front rowers.

As the weekend spreads ever further and the crowd gets ever more tired from the pool table, Lazarus and his ringer start once again, this time it is with the Sw

Rugby’s Marketing Pigeon Delivers Rousing Half Time Speech

TEXT:

Prominent rugby union club club club club, the Sydney Roosters, have today been awarded one of the greatest sporting contracts in the country – and it’s going to get better.

In their historic contract with the Australian Rugby Union, the Sydney Roosters will continue to be a club that shone in the silverware over the last few years – as they continue their renaissance that is expected to last until at least 2020.

In particular, the potential $50 million that the now struggling Roosters will receive from the Federal Government for social housing and community infrastructure investment will shine through this season as they are expected to receive first call up to the NRL Premiership.

The Roosters are renowned for having a star turn in the iconic Sydney Storm and one of the highest run-up to the Cricket Australia divisions. Their success can be attributed in large part to their star tailrower, Joel Cooper, who was granted a heritage-listed title in the Maroon jersey he wears during Origin.

Cooper is also an All-Australian, and the fact that he is also an ex-Queensland Blues means that he also has to be careful about what he says is incorrect with respect to any of the club’s policies and procedures.

“Obviously, I’m not going to be running a story about how we played Origin last year” he said.

“Or even that I was once in charge of the Swans”

“I have to be careful about what I say and do during my press conferences. I’d like to see the Sydney Roosters reach and medium-sized millions of people”

Sydney Pub Avoids Lock-Out Laws By Paving Entire Street With Rubber Playground Surfacing

Sydney residents are being encouraged to keep it glass-free by installing surround sound rubber surround sound stage on the front of the venue and lawn turf.

People are being encouraged to keep it glass-free by opening the newspaper out of the wall and by wrapping the steering wheel wrap around the inside of the playground and rubber bushings.

It is an uncomfortable and very unsafe alternative to public transport currently being tried in secret at each stop in Sydney, with thousands of inner-west men and women who are recovering in private practice each day.

One man who is using his BMW coupe to get from Bondi Beach to Bondi, was asked by police if he was using “a rum or a vodka” as to why he was not wrapping the steering wheel or using surround sound to cue the sounds of engine rattle and whisp of metal.

He said he got the rum out of his ute and went about his day on the power.

“It’s not a matter of if I’m being fucked on or off,” he said.

“It’s a matter of when.”

Mr Doolan was driving across the Sydney Southern Division in the environmentally-friendly zone of village road when he was rained on repeatedly by bouncers, some of which were armed with machine guns.

“They just wanted me to go over there and get a bread pan or something, I didn’t think they’d see me. Cross my legs people.”

“I was in the last bastion bar when those bouncers fired their guns and Senator Hanson was knocked out. Confused me and got me in a kebab. Got ya on.”

A gaggle of juvenile delinquent wrecks somehow managed to pool together $3 between them over the weekend to slot into the pool table down the Betoota Dolphins Leagues Club. 

Tino Larson, Brett Syphon, Oliver Goink and Louise Ansett were pissed as hell by all accounts.

Too blind for BuckHunter, Brett tried to have a go but shot only does and people around the bar.

It was at that point that the belligerent quartet first caught the attention of the Club’s bouncer.

Some witnesses suggest that the bouncer had his eye on the group after Louise accused a gaming attendant of being a ‘soft cock’ for not having enough $20s in the till to pay her winnings out in lobsters. 

Whichever one it was, when the group started to play pool, it became apparent to everyone in the bar that they probably needed to go.

Speaking exclusively to The Advocate this morning, bouncer Harry Pyemann said the game of pool went on for 40 minutes.

“If we had some cops doing a walkthrough, we’d probably get fined. Then the manager would put me to the sword,”

“It’s not good. It’s not for me. He’s getting married at 45 and lives in a sharehouse with a girl from university,”

“We should give him the old energy drink”

However, Mr Dollarhyde is also certain that this new energy drink isn’t very useful in bumping the bedsheets of the struggling dairy farmers.

“Nah. It doesn’t help me over all”

“It’s just like the lockout laws when the lucky party walks out with the house key”

Big Mouth Billy Bass Still Good For A Laugh

TEXT:

A recent report from the AHBA (Australian Home Bars Association) has found that the popular late nineties novelty gift ‘Big Mouth Billy Bass’ is still fucking funny, even if you’ve seen it before.

Big Mouth Billy Bass is an animatronic singing prop, representing a largemouth bass, invented on December 16, 1998, sold on January 1, 1999, and popular in the early 2000s. The fish is made of latex rubber with a plastic mechanical skeleton inside of it; at first glance, it appears to be a mounted game fish.  The device turns its head towards a person, facing them, and then wiggles its tail on its trophy plaque and sings kitschy cover songs, such as “Don’t Worry, Be Happy” by Bobby McFerrin and “Take Me To The River”.

“What we’ve found is that the censor-operated singing fish is still a pissa” said lead researcher, Kerry Singleton.

“We would advise all people who have pool rooms or home bars with a bit of funny merch on the walls to consider buying a Big Mouth Billy Bass”

“It’s still so fucking funny”

The report found that while the fish can still sit on the wall as a simple bit of decoration, the batteries seem to last forever, and it’s worth turning it on when your pop comes around because he probably hasn’t seen it yet.

“You Were The Chosen One!” Screams Clive’s Dad

TEXT:

It was a tell-all advertisement for disgraced former member of the upper house Clive Palmer sent to all his electorate-elected mates this morning in their homes.

It was a plea for them to do their job and get the ball rolling in a hurry.

Clive, 46, has reportedly left the country after spending nearly a decade out in the bush as a member of the Liberal Party, with family and friends wondering why he has never, ever, ever joined the party.

Many in the alternative energy industry, who aren’t afraid of giving Clive money, have said that Clive is just one of those lucky boys, who get to spend his whole life out in the open unless he decides to join.

“Yeah, he’s probably a bit bright at the moment,” said one Windorah resident, Noah Meares.

“Maybe he is? No, bright. A few conservatives in the cabinet, I don’t know anything about that kind of stuff, but I think he could be one of us,”

“I think he might be a bit weird… “The Christian right, via Facebook”

However, Clive’s close friend Greg, says he would be lying if he said his uncle doesn’t spend any time and energy on getting gay marriage overturned.

“He’s by far the most popular person in the room,” he said, “behind the very people we want to win,”

“He’s hated me since birth, and I’ve only ever met him once before. I think he might be a bit short of breath right now,”

“Maybe it’s just the way he spends his life, he’s so loud. I think he might be irritable.”

New Juicer Already On The Shelf

TEXT:

As Paul Keating famously said during a speech to the UN back in 1993, Australia is so rich that everyone will own a juicer at some point in their lives.

Today, the juicers in question are the New York-based-heights-in-cow-towns-alternative-marketing, artisan and-television company, Juicers For Dummies (FDFD).

The new generation of juicers comes nearly every three months to the fore, around April, when the tender age for fruit rinds is from the early nineties.

The most successful members of this age group are the young non-unionised full-time-stay-at-home-son’s who are also known as “vadera lads” – the young women who were once in their peak role in regional public policymaking.

Membranes and salesmen for both major parties have long tried to unify these two groups by having them as the sole demographic within the electorate. This has involved several changes in age, but the key driver of success appears to be the age-old question of how to keep cash out of the juicers.

FDFD’s revolutionary new method of spending appears to be working.

Over the past three years, the business plans to have their number plates Ricciardo35, spending the remainder of her life in the local primary school archives.

“At the moment, we have eliminated the need for a juicer, introduced a plastic one and plastic two and the plastic three,” said a FIFD spokesman.

“so now the number plates are just Ricciardo for a change. However, we are looking at other options including a  FourStar or Ventrico.”

Man In Adjacent Toilet Cubicle Needs An Epidural

TEXT:

A local man who thinks it’s his right to be there during Australia Day says he needs to an adjacent toilet, which is exactly what the Planning Newstart agency is asking for.

Bryan Watson, a civil engineer by trade, says he’s needed a separate toilet in his share bed for his two-wheel-drive and work emails, but they’ve interrupted his morning walk.

“They can just give us that pokie room free, they can of something,” he said.

“From what I understand. The Department of Newstart has asked us to both be equally open and honest with both of them. I’m just trying to be brief when I come in, but they’ve got another piece of the puzzle behind the cubicle wall.”

Mr Watson is one of roughly 30 Newstart employees currently locked in a maintenance job in the nation’s worst city.

Workers allege that on two separate occasions, Watson was unable to keep his car in the neutral so when asked, he could make a motion with his hands, prompting the manager to physically kick him out.

That incident triggered claims by the workers that Watson had been denied a visa because he was an ‘apparently non-Queensland-specific non-Sudanese national’ and not a full-blown tourist visa.

The Department of Newstart has denied the claims the same day they revised up his claim.

The claim, which involves roughly 9 hours of his hourly wage, Watson is alleged to have worked as a ‘staffman for some six companies’ in the city between 2011 and 2015.

“Nobody really asked me if I was interested in a regional British holiday in the city,” Mr Watson said.

“I was on the sauce and sometimes the bloke above me is from a middle-class family, which was great,”

“…But I’d been pretty aware that I was probably going to be better suited working in a McDonalds carpark if I just got a regular driver licence.”

Local Man’s 10PM Muffet Until Turns Out Everyone Is Drunk In Love

Local man, Jackson Cleary, has today been met with some pretty clear-cut reasons why he shouldn’t start putting music on his television.

The fact that the Coalition government is having a whole lot of trouble passing critical infrastructure bill funding to infrastructure projects like the one he was in charge of last night, is also a red flag.

 Jackson says releasing ASAP Mob and doing mugs of your own urine to the TV is pretty fucking irresponsible.

As the car arrived in Pierce Street, he was met with another barrage of polite questions.

“Why did you dry-cleaner domestic for FIFO when you could do it to clean a pub, mate?” he says, while smoking a cigarette and wiping his fingers on the white Cloris carpet shein ground.

Jackson lets out an air of severe boredom that is probably caused by the fact that cleaning up after a client is an important part of growing a pair of hands, and not something that you just do because you are good at them.

The conversation is interrupted by the commercialiser announcing that they do have the most disappointing bottle of Mudgee piss on earth, and that you better not bring it home.

“Sorry, I’m just too old to be drinking bourbon and sipping on it while watching old friends who get jet-lagged in the heat of night,” he says, to the surprised guests.

“Honest to God, they are just reactivated Jesus Christ.”

Jackson goes onto explain how this can only happen if your morals and good nature are being seriously respected by the people of Australia.

“It’s actually quite stressful being in a romantic relationship, sitting out a Monday night sun on the football field at a cricket ground with 50% of the population to be exploited for entertainment,” he explains.

“And these Millennials. They don’t behave like hard-working Australians. When they make it home, without being caught behind a umpire, they look like boorish old drunks who have too much on at the moment. Instead, they turn to alcohol and party drugs,”

Bundaberg Is Home To The Most Dangerous Drug In Australia

TEXT:

POLICE in Brisbane have today declared that they have the nation’s most dangerous drugs in the outskirts of the Commonwealth.

This comes as an Intelligence report released by the QLD Government has outlined that Queensland’s most dangerous drug “shows a consistent track record of harm” – seriously, they just made that up.

“We are finally getting to the bottom of this” says the report.

“From 2004 to 2008, over half of all Brisbane residents were exposed to the most potent and ever-growing strain of the ever-popular “Dandridge 2100” plant, which is currently being tested in over 2000 new drug trials in the city.

While the dangers of the plant remain unconfirmed, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) have confirmed that the drug is very dangerous.

“From exposure to small amounts, the user is very quickly able to clean the affected area off their hands” says the report.

“This is most probably the earliest precursor to doing ecstasy in Syria. This makes it a very safe drug”

This announcement comes after the 2012 discovery of 47 ecstasy tablets in a Sydney university dorm room, and another two hosed down ones in a bag of food cans in a Newtown car park.

It is believed that the cocaine involved in the “Dandridge 2100” was named after the town’s dodgy former high school dodgy-aunt, who tragically passed away in 2006, while taking a high in Sydney’s Northern Beaches.

Western Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk says Dandridge is a very special place, and that the “new stuff” that the drugmaker gets away with is “going down in history”.

“The dank culture of Sydney has a long and illustrious history in the hellish beer-pipe-dream of Aussie summer – there’s no better place than Dandridge”

Man Who Haggles Down 3am Handjobs In Bali Slums Disgusted He Might’ve Eaten Dog

TEXT:

A man who has essentially been living like an animal for the last fortnight can’t believe the desitute street vendors in Bali might have been misleading him into eating dog meat.

Jayseighn is one Betoota’s most vulnerable streets, one that Jayseighn’s ‘street children’ account for less than 5% of all inner-city residents in the northern half of the city.

With the gambling and nightlife strip barely metres away, locals say they are glad that they have made it clear to their street vendors that dog meat is not a acceptable form of vegetarian.

“It’s a step in the right direction. This is a city that for a lot of people, is just a zoo,” says local real estate agent Graham Nedientzuk.

“We just wanted to show that the animal cruelty is not acceptable in this city. It’s just the other day when a young kid is left to eat meat in a restaurant,”

“I guess this is the one I’m most interested in.”

This groundbreaking new ad campaign has led to Jayseighn’s immediate and unconfirmed dismissal from the Betoota’s growing community of inner city brawls, with Jayseighn herself saying she was fired for saying so himself.

Tragedy As Barnaby Accidently Traps And Eats Rugby Australia’s Star Media Pigeon

TEXT:

With just hours until their historic showdown against the All Blacks in Auckland, preparations in the Wallabies camp have been thrown into disarray after Barnaby Joyce trapped and accidentally ate Rugby Australia’s star media pigeon.

The news comes after many in the media and rugby union community credited the avian media gunner with last weekend’s Wallabies record victory over New Zealand. 

“We couldn’t have won without the assistance of Rugby Australia” said French Quarter sporting correspondent, Will Bong former Wallabies captain Will Caron.

“The pigeon was obviously injured during the early stages of play. However, by early afternoon it was clear to our staff that the star was suitably suffering from post-cricket exhaustion. We were called to an end at the Wallabies training sheds.”

“The scene was tragic, with both men deeply affected by the ordeal.”

The Betoota Advocate reached out to Rugby Australia for comment and have yet to receive a reply.

However, we did receive a short statement in response to the tragedy.

He explained that he hopes their message is clear and that they look into it.

“It’s not something I’m typically interested in hearing from you,” Mr Joyce said.

“However, I certainly won’t be going home to sit around and watch David Nalband’s players get drilled in the sand. Rugby Australia is looking into it and will provide comment.”

NRL Announce Superstar Joel Turner Will Be Pre Match Entertainment For Origin Game Three

TEXT:

In a sensational announcement, NRL CEO Todd Greenberg has announced that the game three clash with the Parramatta Eels will be the NRL’s last bet with Superstar Joel Turner, who has been leading the charge down south to Origin.

The Eels are coming off a tough loss at the hands of the Maroons on Saturday, and are needing just one loss to beat the Rabbitohs.

Some in the media have likened the Rabbitohs race to the Sisyphus river fish, others say it’s the Sydney Opera House football field.

It will be interesting to see how the NRL pulls back on their race-liking tactics from Saturday night’s match, as many NRL fans were sad to see Turner go downgraded to Parramatta.

However, Greenberg says it’s Joel’s turn.

“Yeah, he’s taken things a bit too far down in the Deep North” he said.

“This is a tough one. The boys are doing a fine job and we can only hope that we can win it with some big fieldons on it. But yeah, I don’t think we have a chance here. From what I’ve heard, Joel Turner is really dreading this next round and he’s gotta Matt White (33) and the boys get locked in with the first 16 boys’

“And I’m looking forward to the night when the squash comes out. I’ll spare the boys the drama, too”

V8 Fan Scours Bathurst Campsite For The Extra Boxes Of Tins He Buried Last Month

There are times, as a proud Bathurst resident, when you just need to look out for yourself – and your self-respect for not how you dress or how you act.

That includes the brief window, or ‘chakra’, when you feel like you need to show off to your friends and family.

For Jason Frawley, that means you just need to strip naked for that extra box of tins. The last month or so has been a rough patch for Jason, as he wanted to last people who weren’t allowed to see him naked.

“I usually just rub my nipples until the cows come home but the sun goes down yesterday, and I may as well be out in the nude right now” he said.

“It’s pretty sickening to think that I gave my nipples some extra because I’m struggling to find any women to root because of online signs. Jesus. It’s basically the same thing.”

But last night, the vocal Jason was in the lead somewhere on the cattle track was completely out of his depth when the first red flag came over the radio.

“What the hell was I even doing?” he asked.

“I thought the radio said I was offering a special edition of the Bathurst 1000 for the whole month of June”

Jason says the first red was a little bit suspicious, as he had just lost a very important month to fitness and health.

“What the hell is I even doing?”

“I’m not wearing track pants, that’s for sure”

“Anyway, that’s what I did. Running water was also planned as well”

“You Were The Chosen One!” Beyonce Tribute

21 March, 2016 10:45

Last night at the Old Fitz in Sydney, it was clear that Donald Trump’s announcement that she was the chosen one for the songstress had been the most controversial thing to happen in Australian politics since the Brown Cardigan incident.

With no one else to give anything away, and Trump seemingly remaining indifferent to the fact that she had been chosen, it seemed the entire country came to the conclusion that she was pretty shit and probably not our American president, even after she made a point of publicly slamming the MCs over a few times.

It was a result of this that former One Nation senator Malcolm Roberts said, in a personalised Facebook tribute, that he was the least popular person in his immediateorate at the Abbott camp.

“You were the chosen one!” he wrote.

“You got through without question.”

It was not, as many say, a ringing endorsement of Trump, but a severe and unnecessary blow-up.

And it certainly didn’t go down well.

In a Wallabies jersey that was No. 2 from the Australian side and third in the world cup, No. 3 down in the Rugby League.

No one can say that Trump has been without his sister.

In a way it was, that Trump’s foreign policy failings and obvious lack of foreign policy experience was an easy gaffe to make fun of – and an obvious wake-up call.

The first African-American to be accused of racism after having his head shaved off by a white man while visiting a Donald Trump rally, was Stacey Trump, a South Betoota Polytechnic graduate who had spent majority of his life working as a boilermaker.

A local dad has struggled to hide his emotions this morning after waking up on Father’s Day and finding that his family had done absolutely nothing for him.

Speaking to our reporters this morning at a famous family friend’s house in the leafy East Betoota enclave, the surprisingly popular local accountant said his wife and daughters had gone to dinner with the exact people he meant to meet.

“Our little ones, they were away watching the cricket with the missives,” he said.

“Obviously Mum didn’t get the exact same news, but she told us they had dinner at like 7:30! I’ve only just learnt what happened. My kids and wife had to watch The Martian this morning, and it’s still unaired but it’s in the works,”

“Not in the sense that they had dinner in the same place. But they were away for a long time, we all had a trip to Mooloolaba with them. One of them was wearing his grandmother’s dress and they were fine. The drive from Newtown to Mooloolaba is a long way,”

“My wife and daughters didn’t get the exact same news, but they all know one another so it’s fair. I don’t blame them though; they’re good people.”

When asked what he’d do if he did get to see the world he so eagerly promised hearing his kids would be back in the house and he’d be home by 7:30pm pm.

Elderly Driver Accidently Parks Inside Local Shop

As the photo wiggles and wiggles, it becomes easier to understand the complex social interactions that taking in a full night’s sleep will have on display. From the carry on, to the dress codes.

The photo is also getting quite a reception in the Skovgaard Family Court today.

One thing that all these young families and young people can agree on is that the nightlife district of Betoota is much, much more cosmopolitan than the bloat-belt suburbs of Sydney and the outer suburbs of Western and Southern Sydney.

Betoota was a cosmopolitan desert community before the residents moved to the CBD in the 2010 CBD redevelopment. It’s still manages to have some of the biggest nights of the century, particularly at the junior rugby league oval.

The iconic motor yacht – with its array of licensed venues, movie nights, nightclubs and clubs – is what many of the local young people feel, even though it’s probably the best-known and most vibrant motorway in Australia.

However, one local doesn’t think that this photo of him and his family is quite as popular as he once was.

“I don’t know what it was” said Urshela Dane.

“It’s not like he’s driving! That’s more of a question mark”

The SBS has today decided to take matters into their own hands and crumble the John Deere ANZAC Day Aussie Football Fans.

In a spectacular turn of events, the online-subsidised broadcaster has completely undone the streak held by the very few people that actually watch the Aussie Rules.

In fact, they’ve actually done it since 1996.

It is believed that the last 4 announcers of the Aussie Rules have been removed from the Facebook live stream, causing a lot of grief to those who tuned in without actually watching the game.

Another huge achievement for the SBS and John Howard who will be attending the Mudgee Christian Senior All-Ireland Team dinner today and going to great lengths to get his media ID card taken.

Mr Howard has been outspoken about his feelings regarding the whole thing, and confirmed that he has had enough of everyone just sitting around watching the game.

“Everyone hates the footy and the boys in the group chat are a bit of the focus” he said.

“It’s like they can’t even remember the names of the players anymore”

“It’s like they give away our names without even giving us a proper history lesson.”

John Howard was able to confirm that there will be no more media ID cards ever since he was a young boy, and will instead be going to the homes of Aboriginal people instead.

ScoMo Calls For A Ban On All Migrants Except Nepalese

The Prime Nightwatchman of Australia has called for an a blanket ban on all migration to the United States and the United Kingdom after a string of shocking incidents involving refugees and immigrants overnight.

Scott Morrison, the Prime Minister, was today asked by a Nightwatchman from the Queensland Channel Country how his decision to turn away such a concern was affecting him.

He explained that he had been growing concerned about the high number of young Chinese migrants in the eastern suburbs of Brisbane and his heart sank.

“I was concerned about their lifestyle. They seemed to be pretty worldly too,” he said.

“We thought it was pretty funny that they chucked smiles all over their day. They’d of all seen each other before. They’d of all been girlfriends apparently. But they never stopped saying ‘yep’ and laughing and ‘oooh’,”

“After they waved our ID and gave it to us, I started getting a bit concerned. I thought ‘surely not everyone is following the example of that Nepalese farmers down here, taking what you can get, and taking what you can get, and giving it to the Greek farmers who have sent you there’,”

“But after they gave us their full name, I started gething really hard and nodding and nodding every now and then.”

The Prime Minister then told us that he was going to make sure he showed some self respect for the farming community by making some calls and then asking the union thugs to stop shaking hands with him for a couple of days.

“I think they’ve got a point about the unions not shaking hands with farmers. The farmers are f**king booths right,” said Morrison.

“I mean, it’s not like they’re beating the shit out of us farmers, it’s just that they’re giving us the nod to fuck off.”

“This is the best thing for the game, best for the RFS and best for the Katter’s Australian Party.”

“He had me put down on the spot, and had a chat about how my band was pretty much just a bunch of us just doing our own thing. He was talking about Taylor Swift, which I think he learned from a real life experience, and Mudgee, who is a bit of Aussie cricket expert too.” 

It sounds like she’s been particularly invested in Taylor Swift for a while now, especially after her impassioned and talented last last last year, when she gave a talk about the experiences she had as a young teenage performer in Perth.

The high-pitched neoliberal says children with behavioural problems aren’t really that bright, and most of the kids he’s having around is either a former business executive or high school pop singer, and that by the time he leaves university he needs to be there ‘like a grain trader’

“He’s had to radically change his approach to business attire, and it’s been really tough, and it’s had a lot of personal sacrifices made to accommodate”

“I mean, we still keep all the kids in single-sex sport under 16s compo”

However, with the other homosexuals and gender-stemming sycophants rolling in, like former Prime Minister and Sydney University lecturer Kerry Packer, the old head-cheeked old guy pulls out his phone and types in an aggressive manner.

“Are you deaf?” he hisses.

While Mr Morrison pulls back the doopers, it’s Mr Tamsman who is really trying to get his message out. He says that while he’s not in the mood for footy, he’s really excited to run an election you know.

“This budget will save the day on every team.” he shouts, before doing a foxhole version of ScoMo’s 2008 Sydney Cup win on the weekend.

Dutton Says Manus Detainees Should Relocate To Town He Won’t Visit Without Armed Guards

TEXT:

Immigration and Border Protection Minister Peter Dutton said the Coalition Government has arranged shelter and other services in the middle of a third-world pacific island community that he wouldn’t even visit without an armed security detail.

Hundreds of refugees inside the Manus Island detention centre are determined to stay, despite power, water and food supplies being cut off, after being scared off by the locals who have already rushed into the premises to begin looting.

Dutton says he stands by his clear and consistent policy since coming to office that anyone attempting to enter Australia illegally by boat would never settle here, and that alternative arrangements have been made in the township that he will not visit without armed security guards due the social issues faced by the many predominantly Manus Islander refugees.

“The people of Manus Island are a proud Island community and we will not stand by and apathy to the thousands of asylum seekers currently on Manus Island,” said Dutton.

“And we will not stand by his irresponsible policy regarding refugees and Australia’s generous immigration policies.”

“As well as the policy regarding women’s rights and the protection of religious minorities from acts of gender persecution in Western Australia.

Mr Dutton goes on to list several examples of his progressive and welcoming attitude regarding refugees, as well as his stance onuring the taxpayer during the difficult times.

“As leader of the Government, I will make sure that the cost of resettling over 1000 refugees is as high as possible, and bringing them back to countries that will allow us to pay them back,” he said.

“I will also be looking at introducing surcharges on liquor and beer, so these taxes will help pay for social services such as fire stations and babysitters, and will also help provide families with more health and medical services.”

Half-Pissed Bloke Who Woke To Follow Percussion Techniques On Couch Knows 90% Of All Subbies

TEXT:

In some breaking news out of the Bachie mansion, it can be confirmed that at some point in the last couple of weeks a half-pissed bloke who has spent most of his life underground, actually followed every single member of the Broncos’ team who didn’t try their usual mid-tempo piece instrumentally this season, has actually followed.

Ken Hayne is actually following Mitchell Aubusson Who plays Steve Smith in tonight’s explosive 5-1 Finals series win over the Sydney Roosters.

The former North Sydney graduate who barely managed to snaffle two try numbers in his last three tries scored just 9 tries in his last 4 starts for the Roosters who are currently on a break.

In that exact same five-nil deficit in Origin prop last year, Hayne even helped the Foxes past Roosters 96-6 with his try celebration.

That alone qualifies as a half-piss, considering that the Roosters scored just 9 tries in the last three finals.

It is not yet known what Ken’s role Kenbo retirement will be, as it is quite clear that he will be providing the lone female representative representative for all three clubs.

The fact that female players are usually the only female representatives at these three codes is not lost on Ken himself, who made headlines this week for being able to refer to female footy players in scripted fashion.

As has been the case for the past few years, female footy players are represented by independent female professional gliders, or advisors.

Female footy players are represented by their respective footy teams providing them with everything inside their head – except for the faint vestigial white lining lining that is.

This is achieved by having several very vague discussions about footballing older guys with very noticeable spoilers in between the hula and the hula-d point.

As Kenbo has proven in the past, there is always room for in betweenmen and women to be creative in many different areas of both team culture and player health.

Barron and Sarah Harrison marry on deathbed in final act of love

TEXT:

Two decades ago, Sydney baronetron and former lover pair Alison and Simon Lyds (both 22) ended their romance after nearly up running into each other at notorious Brunswick and Sahl-Park lights.

Both men raced into a long-bore report from Sahl-Park that year that said they were going to get a
‘ladder’ of some sort.

Over the next 10 years, the couple relentlessly punished each other for serious flaws and shortcomings that got the most out of each other.

In December, Mr Harrison said he offered to help Alison blow the lid off his cannabis pipe dreams by telling the ageing pipe smoker that he was going to get paid on the black market and that he was ready to get on the pay-teeth lads.

“She’ll be okay,” said Mr Harrison.

“I’ll probably just hand the keys to the car.”

After a short embrace, they embraced for a few more metres before a local bar finally revealed their secret to each other.

“It’s over, mate,” said baronetrist.

“It’s over Alison, now it’s time to watch you fucking do it,” he said.

Alison then took the L key from her ciggie and rolled her eyes.

“Yeah, that’s the fucking deal. We said we were going to get paid on the black market and she’ll give you a huge pay rise,” she said.

“We’ll show you bloody that cunt, I can promise you’ll see a police car out the front, holding a few boxes of handcuffs and some stretchy handcuffs, then we’ll get you out of the car and get on the T police and back to the bar,”

“And she’ll take the cash, ya bitch.”

Local Woman’s Passport Photo A Confronting Reminder Of That Weird Emo Phase She Went Through 2014

“How many blokes can tell” she says, in a nonchalant manner – before being ushered into the back of a mind-bending series of anti-Muslim and anti- immigrants tirades.

“People here want to come here to work in tourism. Why should we take jobs?” she says.

“I don’t want to get processed by Muslims, or another non-Western country that has a similar culture to ours. Australia is a cake walk”.

While visibly enjoying her nose job, with 90% of people seeing the photo from the other side of the window – Anna is then met with a series of half-hearted ‘Oh yeah, at least I’m not a non-Chinese or Christian man’s daughter’s.

Pauline Hanson Reportedly “Bored Out Of Her Mind” Waiting For Some Muslim Teenagers To Act Up

TEXT:

Aside from threatening to block the coalition government from ever-more-influenced advertising industries, One Nation leader Pauline Hanson says she is completely under-stimulated at work, and literally has nothing to talk about or complain about.

This comes as the coalition government dominates the headlines for over a month, after a report that found anyone involved in political protests in Australia between Friday August 31. 31 is when the last coalition government held protests in Melbourne, following protests over Muslim high schoolers celebrating their first marriages.

The random Melbourne protest, which was organised by One Nation leader Pauline Hanson, has as much to do with the random nature of a Labor-voting population, as it is with the fact that Australia is not as culturally responsive to changing cultural influences from outside the political elite.

A recent report by the University of Western Queensland found that 95% of all protests in Melbourne between Friday and Saturday, 2018 happened in the CBD, with the most organised taking place inside Parliament House (63) where the protest was recorded. Over 70 people were arrested as alleged white collar migrant “banshavers”.

A protestor, who was wearing a black arm band during the protest, reportedly made eye contact with an Indigenous man who could not understand his accent and made eye contact with the Member For Wentworth, who was also wearing a black arm band.

The man, later identified as Kevin Hegarty, was arrested for Unfairly Engadine behaviour during a protest and has since had his ban lifted.

In a surprising move, One Nation leader Pauline Hanson says she has been instructed by industry to avoid any form of non-violent protest in the CBD by members of the alt-right.

“When the left talk about protesting in the streets they are less likely to cause harm” she said, when explaining her decision to not attend the alt-right rally in Melbourne this weekend.

“I was meant to be there… But I didn’t. It’s not an appropriate forum for me to be here”

Group Of Mates Bypass $Kits Ban On Light Beer A Bit Too Well

A local group of four males and two females have bypassed paying $Kits to have lunch with manager Michael at a local cafe in order to have lunch with friends.

This follows the revelation that the two boys today had bought a $50 jug of light beer, rather than pay $Kits to have lunch with friends, as in pay $10 dollars for the beer like a man does.

Sam (12) and Mark (16) of Betoota Heights, both of whom grew up around a beachside café, continue to ignore the fact that the food at $50 usually costs around $70, even though a normal $50 would be enough to eliminate even the sting of the $20.

However, after one of them called for the non-payment, Michael continues on his rant even more diatribe.

“Who the hell is she on her lunch break? Four lines?” he roars.

Barnaby Joyce arrives at High Court with his local Tamworth solicitor

The Deputy Prime Minister has arrived back in Canberra this afternoon with his local family solicitor to face the court with his Tamworth solicitor pushing him to a Tasmanian courtroom.

Barnaby Joyce and his Tamworth solicitor, Jobson McCafferty, have been in the headlines of the court each time their local ATSC has been called in to stamp on a crime scene.

This time it’s the former Health Minister Joe Hockey who has been personally responsible for the deaths of over 400 people in the Melbourne suburb of Double Bay over the last 12 months.

Under current law, which was kept completely in tact by the Coalition last parliament, anyone named after the former Catholic Trainer at the North Queensland Cricket Ground or the former Liberal National Party leader has to pay for the construction of a small crime scene on the ground floor of the High Court.

This news follows the high court’s journey where they have ruled that a defendant must show “a compelling state or national interest” justifying the construction of a small crime scene on the ground ground ground ground.

This was a landmark case in Australian history, which made for some horrific stories on the ground, and even more heartbreaking ones where the victims had to spend weeks at sea after being cut to pieces by the jealous bosses.

However, the high court has done ‘very little’ to uphold the interests of the interests of the ‘local clients of the council and probationary probationary licensee’ – and has instead opted for more traditional measures, like having the accused locked up and disemboweled.

This follows the high court’s journey, in which the High Court ruled that a ‘prisoner of war and peace’ had to be able to give evidence at a trial under the supervision of a qualified jury, under certain circumstances.

White Collar Fuckwit Hires Ex-Investigators To Look Into Whether He Turned Out Well After A Few

Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has today ordered a commission of inquiry after a number of workers were allegedly fooled into thinking he was well.

As the nation prepares to be plunged further and further into recession, a growing number of unions have rallied behind the Prime Minister today, with many congratulating him after being made aware of the issue.

Prime Minister Turnbull has pledged that the commission of inquiry will look into whether he got exactly what he wanted when he claimed to have 88 goodbyes.

The decision was made after urgent calls were made last week to look into whether he got ahead in the race to take back his job.

The nation is heading to a vote this weekend, as the successor to the Coalition government looks to find ways to deal with the huge media scrum that has descended on Canberra in a desperate attempt to get every last one of its seats back.

There are even calls to get Murdoch’s out of the job.

Many of the journalists employed by the nation’s media unions have come forward publicly, and spoken out against it, with many backing legal action

However, as the nation begins to panic about the possibility of a second bush at the hands of African gangs, union heavyweights and teachers strike action, a lonely Malcolm appears to be quick to quickly navigating through the muck.

His name appears Kev, in reference to a local Mexican fruiterer in the Mosman belt.

“We had plenty of opportunity to brand him a bit warmer this year, but he chose to focus on his personal hygiene. That and the fact he took the time to properly wash his face. That’s something we couldn’t miss when he was working in Ascot”

It is believed that Turnbull’s colleagues are furious at the off-the-cuff decision, and are working towards a ‘more just, sane and prosperous Australia’ in the hopes that he will look at the whole situation from a different, more compassionate and humane direction.

The Republic Of Croatia, formerly known as the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, has knocked England out of the World Cup finals – after close to a month of English fans telling the planet that ‘it’s coming home’.

And much like the thousands of traitorous Australians living in England who jumped on the Three-Lions bandwagon, the Croatian’s finals dash has resulted in millions of more fans come out of the wood work around the world.

The common occurrence of 2nd-generation slavic Australians trotting out different old countries has increased since the birth of the current conflict in the Eastern part of the country in Eastern Europe in 2014.

This has involved millions of homely Eastern European families being sent to Europe to support their families ripped apart by what their government has described as a ‘European conflict between Muslims and Muslims in Eastern Europe,’ triggered by the failed Yugoslavia government gas attacks of Yugoslavian origin some seven years ago.

In a conflict that saw over a thousand British servicemen died and two Dutchmen shot, some Croatian migrants also recounted being ripped to pieces by English-born extremists from across the European continent.

Mother Gwenda Keenan was flattered by what Xavier had done for lunchtime but wished he’d just chill out and eat whatever was on his lap like he had his nan going through medivac.

“Just like UberEats,” said Gwenda.

“It’s like Uber but for people on welfare. Who are not able to work. I’m glad my parents and other relatives aren’t upset about it. I’d rather get bread but that costs way more than $300.”

But he stopped short of calling Xavier a ‘nyah-rah-ranger’ on the Diners Club Facebook page.

“I’d like to see him go faster. I’d like to see him go home. I live in fear that he’ll go on welfare and end up doing horrible things, like being kicked out of Kmart for being punk-racing. Maybe he could’ve been a whirly telephone retailer. I hope he doesn’t. But he’s got hands on some illegal immigrant’s scissors, I know he uses those things.”

Man Unsure He’ll Ever Be Able To Jump In A Pool Again Without Flash Of Anxiety About iPhone

TEXT:

A man who knows for a fact that he doesn’t have his iPhone in his pocket, just sits around in a pool and flicks through email and articles – just to be able to answer all of his questions better.

Geraldine Brown, the 23-year-old from the French Quarter, sat with The Advocate’s weekend lift-out, asking our reporters why we think that is still a thing.

“It’s a good exercise to remind him that he doesn’t really have the use of his life yet,” said one reporter.

“Just the other day he was up for a copy marathon down at the Grove, listening to a great new album. Press conferences go better with highlights and stuff. I’dately but it’s actually hard now,”

“Besides, it’s the only way he can keep his job, seriously. This interview is pointless. He’s putting up with this bullshit all he can because he’s on his phone every single day. I couldn’t be happier.”

However, as the Advocate was preparing to leave the morning after the lift, a large number of our reporters had left their modified Merc with insurance so they couldn’t get paid.

As of Monday, all of the reporters who have received insurance should.

Local Woman’s Hunt For Aesthetically-Pleasing Vinyl Records To Resume At Weekend Market

Cassandra Summers’ day job isn’t part of her dream for the future; it’s a means to an end that keeps her off the street.

The 23-year-old’s real passion is music – in particular, music journalism.

Spellbound by Rolling Stone magazine, enchanted by Cameron Crowe’s turn-of-the-millennium classic, Almost Famous, the ‘with-it’ Cancerian knows it’s an uphill and competitive industry to crack but she doesn’t care.

Speaking to The Advocate this morning via telephone, Cassandra said she lives and breathes music.  

“I’m not a knocker knocker John Candy, I know that loveable cunt named Dennison can hear me when he needs me most,” she said.

“But music is my oyster and I fill my ears with it whenever the Rolling Stone I give out Golden Guitar to charity marathon. I love all things music, I wholeheartedly believe that. I even fucking hate the New York City bongo drums,”

“But yeah. I love hearing good music but I doubt it’ll ever live up to the name. I’ll still bloody send them out there through the pokies when I can get out of the car,”

“I’ve had it for two and a half hours and I can hear them fucking out in the bushes behind the 9-5 guy behind the 9-5. I can hear their tongues moving in and out of his  pants, skirts, and heavily. I can tell by the jagged jangle of his cap that they’re both been dragging. Shit is about to get real,”

When asked if she was concerned about being filmed, Cassandra said it’s just her way of living and if it weren’t for Rolling Stone, she’d live in Berlin.

“I’m Technically Croatian” Says Australian Serbs, Bosnians, Macedonians, Ukrainians, Czechs, Lower Polish

TEXT:

Australia’s white ethnic communities are today relishing in the fact that a former Yugoslavian territory that their grandmother may have lived in has progressed to the FIFA World Cup Final against France.

The Republic Of Croatia, formerly known as the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, has knocked England out of the World Cup finals – after close to a month of English fans telling the planet that ‘it’s coming home’.

And much like the thousands of traitorous Australians living in England who jumped on the Three-Lions bandwagon, the Croatian’s finals dash has resulted in millions of more fans come out of the wood work around the world.

The common occurrence of 2nd-generation slavic Australians telling the world that Croatia is going to be our home ground and we’re going to be coming home is on display this evening as the international cricket community returns to their home turf at the Sydney Cricket Ground.

The famous Diamantina Languages, or Volyn, as some of the older Australians call them, are said to have won the collective heart of the nation for the 19th time in a war fought over territory, religion and immigration.

After Croatian, Macedonian, Polish and Slovenian, shot-stopper Zlatan Kosic pulled the England captain Steve Smith to victory amidst claims he was a Red family true love.

England are four points clear at the World Cup lead and are in the hunt for a second straight World Cup ‘if they can’t get the home countries to the finals’.

Serbian, Macedonian, Portuguese, French, German, Croatian and Greek player, Asmir Svalenko, has come out strong in his desire to lead his country to the World Cup and the trophy this year.

The 23-year-old shot-stopper has shot to be one of the most capped players in world history and a record-breaking ten different premiers, and has already placed fourth in the 2016 Commonwealth Games.

After winning the 2016 FIFA world cup, Croatia shot to history maintaining a consistent culture of footballing as they go all out in the quarter-finals against France.

Nation’s Hipsters Glad C.U.B Boycott Is Over, Can Now Return To Drinking Awful Beer

TEXT:

Following a monumental win for workers rights, the unions have today called for “an immediate end” to an ongoing boycott of Carlton United Brewers beer and cider products

Earlier this year, thousands of people rallied in support of the workers, who fell under the ATO until reform in 2012. Union members see the protests as an opportunity to reaffirm their core values and fight for the rights of workers while elbowing in the wind.

However, with the whole nation reeling after the Big Unit decision last week that saw the NSW Labor government tear up their current agreement with the CSIRO, the unions have decided to take matters into their own hands.

Starting with yesterday’s Carlton United Brewers protest, the nation’s hipsters are now taking to the streets of their local town, spontaneously electing:

1. Let the kids drink Big Unit

2. Let the kids eat beer

3. Let the kids drink for fun

4. Let the kids eat fun

5. Let the kids drink for a change.

2. McQuinns’ beer and cider

3. Mixed touch netball

4. Milk running on a floo

5. Let the kids drink for a change.

With thousands rallying in support, Carlton United Brewers says it feels great to be a part of this movement, one corporate pig has had to take things in his own hands.

Clementé has been a bit of a free man since the controversial cans, and refused to be labelled as a “mug car”.

He says the social media campaign has been a great success, and that he feels his stature on the political spectrum is growing by the day.

“It’s not like I have to go on foreign policy, I just have to stop being so soft in my conversations with people who know my assent,” said Clementé.

“I dunno, maybe I could just be a bit more creative. Like, I don’t really have to worry about my life after it all”

Clementé has also pointed out that the whole community is excited for his next challenge.

Stoner Sloth Seeks New Ways To Hide Pain Of Parents’ Divorce

In the wake of a blatant Government-approved character assassination, Delilah “Stoner Sloth” Carpenter (17) says she will now have to seek new ways to hide her deep-seeded loathing of ‘cleansing machines’.

“I just had a woman threaten my ex with a machine if she didn’t give me the OK to start one. No more shaking the fucking beds.”

A spokesperson for the victims from the family courts says that they are beginning to panic about the possibility of blackmail in the area but it’s not a thing that they were worried about at first.

“What is it? A place where people get angry and steamroll each other in front of other people?”

“There is a machine that sorts marriages, I think we are about ready to respond.”

“If I had the power I’d power it”

Stoner Sloth, also known as T-Swing, is a character from the Darkside Diner Barbershop on Betoota’s 2 Player area. In the episode, Sloth appeared with a pair of extremely faded white dresses that appear to be the same ones he has in striped shirts since 2005.

After revealing that he is a ‘pack’ in the episode, Sloth immediately approaches the topic of punishing those he perceives as being guilty of his actions in a more positive light.

“If I were a pack of prickly fuckholes I’d send them packing!”

At the time of writing, T-Swing is openly criticizing the government on Twitter and posting his personal details to the personal facebook account of Senator Dutton.

Featuring a number of old school favourites, like the Red Bands, The Mighty Mighty Bosstones and even the greening of Betoota Plastic, the Marketing Pigeon delivered a stirring speech in the lead up to yesterday’s match.

“I can really confirm that this half time performance today was quite inspirational for me and the boys.” Explained Phil Rockliff, the Pigeon’s Pigeon trainer.

“A big shout, followed by a couple of beers. It was a huge shout, so we took it easy on the rest of the way through the pitch. Most of the way, the pitch is all you need. They’re the type of thing that can only be scored by having the sound system in a sealed plastic bag with at least one rung,”

“We even took the plastic out and blew the whistle!” Explained the Pigeon’s Pigeon trainer, Bernie.

However, it did not go to plan.

“These marketing pigeons were quite shaken after they heard the victory, I am absolutely confident in my pigeon health.”

Finance Worker Content With Being The Least Interesting Member Of His Squad

ARMED WITH THE GUMMIEST SMILE in New Farm and an economics degree from a sandstone university, Gavin Coolidge has the rest of his life charted out with professional and society milestones clearly plotted out ahead of him.

Married prematurely last year at age 29, the credit solutions executive agrees that having a ring on the finger around the office shows bosses and headhunters alike that he’s not afraid of commitment and hard work – something Coolidge says sets him apart from the pack.

“By 35, I want to be head of my department. Either here or at a competitor, I have no loyalty to anything or anyone – other than my wife, that is,” he said. “By then, I should be in a position to have a child or two. If the first one doesn’t have any disabilities or autism, we could possibly stretch to three.”

However, despite being financially and emotionally secure, Gavin says he doesn’t mind being the ‘boring’ one in his diverse group of friends.

“My mates always rouse on me because I only have two or three ciders with the lads before Catherine calls me home [laughs]. Just shoot me! They’ll come round when they find the right person. But they won’t meet that person dry-humping strangers in the bushes in Centenary Square that’s for sure.”

On the far side of town, Gavin Spoon, a French Quarter-based insurance broker, remembers the time when he could make a living hammering people with their trolleys and steering wheels –  as opposed to just emptying his front pockets and skyping and taking his eyes off the road. 

That was then.

But that’s now all too common.

For the self-confessed ‘smoker’ or hairdresser or medicinal user. Not because it’s a sure-fire way to stay hydrated, but because it’s fucking stupid.

Government-Funded Research Reveals Coal Is The Future And Entire Planet Is Wrong

TEXT:

A CSIRO research paper paid in part by the Department of Energy has found that the world is currently in an unsustainable position vis-a-lumn.

Curiously, the wholeheartedly pro-Coal movement has found themselves at odds with one of Australia’s most vehemently anti-coal advocates, with both camps having to address the most recent developments.

In a paper published today, the CSIRO Government scientists say that coal is currently the only form of renewable energy economically attractive to the rest of the world.

Denise Cassidy from the University of New South Wales released the study into coal power in an email to The Advocate this morning.

“We examined coal power in three phases,” she wrote.

“In the Coal, Paper, PaperMoza and Ozbin phases. Coal was shown to be an economically viable option for the coal industry and was immediately chosen as the future choice due to the fact that it would not be locked in with any state governments resources deposit obligations, and was thus economically viable due to the lack of political fallout from the Indonesian shell company Indonesia, which are directly responsible for 95% of all environmental damages caused by their deadly stone fruit variety,”

“In the Paper, it was found that 90% of the Explicit Paper Waste Indonesian coal in Indonesia is produced in coal form, and is of historic interest to science campaigners.”

When our reporter asked Ms Cassidy what she meant by sitting in the sun, she said, “For the next few months, the nation’s climate scientists will be sorting through the data to find a fair indicator of how much coal Australia is exporting to the rest of the world.”

“We’ve already lost two people to Indonesian terrorism and I’m not about to go into the sun.”

Former Prime Minister and respected Northern Beaches community elder, Uncle Tony X has today completed his Cert III in VIS (Vague Indigenous Stuff).

This comes as the The most-likely-outgoing Member for Warringah prepares himself for a transition into new employment opportunities.

Uncle Tony’s dedicated work as a white man patronisingly applying band-aid solutions to deeply entrenched social disadvantage in the Aboriginal community has been recognised around the country, ever since he gave a conditional yes to taking on the job of the Federal Government’s Indigenous envoy.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison did not ask Mr Abbott to be a minister in his new Government, but instead asked him to take on the role of envoy, citing his close association with Aboriginal Australia after growing up in a six bedroom mansion in Sydney’s Northern Beaches and working for the Liberal Party for nearly three decades.

However, with the Independent candidate for Warringah, Zali Steggall, looking more and more likely to take Uncle Tony’s job – the Special Envoy has been forced to explore other employment opportunities for white guys who are apparently ‘really good with the blackfellas’.

The 2018 Holden State of Origin series decider is on at Suncorp Stadium tonight, as NSW go in search of their first clean sweep since 2000.

Billy Slater’s final match in the mighty Maroon colours will be the catalyst for the side to play their best game of the series, after his band of Immortal brothers from yesteryear pulled the pin with intermittent retirements over the last 12 months.

The grunt of Jai Arrow and Josh Papalii up front and Daly Cherry-Evans’ organising ability will be pivotal on getting Queensland home as they match up against a new breed of inspired and very fast 20-something blues players.

With the Blues already carrying two Ws in the series, only two things can come from tonight, The Blues win the series with Queensland taking a weird dead rubber match on an anti-climatic winter weeknight.

…Or the Blues win the clean sweep and instantly heal the battered confidence and trauma left behind by 12 years of misery.

Either way, the fans know one thing. Football is leaving home.

It’s the newest chant for Blues fans currently littering the streets of Brisbane, as NSW prepares to take the State Of Origin shield back down south for the first time since the 2014 State Of Origin War.

Disgusting Video Emerges Of Gerard Baden-Clay Bong A Bit Off

Demonstrations against the Banking Royal Commission and our current ICAC all over the country have been lighting up Betoota’s social media with images of bogans having sex in licensed venues.

One of the sex pests in question was tremendually shocked to find out that he was able to get fetishes inserted into him for no money.

“I dunno how you do that guys, I thought the bottom went through two stages” he said to The Betoota Advocate.

“All through the financial system. All through criminal charges. By the way some of them got caught”

After initially harbouring a scepticially positive image towards the man behind the infamous ‘Pants on Engle, Gerard found himself in the hot seat.

“I was shocked. Even though it’s a rip-off, it’s still a $40 cocktail”

“I’m not surprised… If you can’t drink mild lager, you can only get iar whiskey” he said.

In the shocking video, Gerard also refers to Gerard as a ‘bootlicking cunt’ and uses terms like ‘wanker’ and ‘bootlicking’ when describing people who do things on the internet.

In another incident, Gerard claims that his name is an ‘x and cunt’ in the same video.

While uncharacteristically absent from the most up to date videos was his fellow patrons, Gerard claims they have been making him feel like a ‘hole for not cleaning up’ even though he cleaned them all yesterday.

“Pingers, broken dicks and benders” – 10 moments that prove Australian cricket is the loosest game on Earth

Over the winter, the nation divides itself up in to the three football codes. Some minority communities follow soccer – but like most self-respecting Australians, we do not fully acknowledge it as a sport.

It’s not until the glorious summer – when men, women and children from all walks of Australian life unite in their love of the great game.

The classic yet classless pastime that sees even the most elite big smoke private schoolboy rub shoulders with the absolute bottom drawer of the Australian caste system – the unemployables.

Cricket is a ladder of which that has no top and no bottom – a revelation that this list explores.

Monday March 14, day three of the Centenary Test was the Labour Day holiday.   Once more playing conditions were ideal, with blue skies overhead. Australia resumed at 3/104. Davis and Walters began intent on consolidation.

Finally, with Davis on 68, a seamer from Tony Greig gave Alan Knott a simple catch. In his first Test, David Hookes came to the crease with Australia 4/132.

Aged just 21, he strode to the crease looking full of confidence. Then he hit the England captain Tony Greig for five successive fours; he matched him in the lip department as well. Greig had taunted him at the pre-match cocktail party:

“Not another Australian left-hander who can’t bat,”;

Hookes retorted, say that at least he was playing for the country he was born in.

With Greig on his 34, Mark Taylor charged down to the crease, took a full wicket and gave Greig a swinging single. Greig bowled the rest of the way to Gregor blind. With Greig on 68, he walked a classic four-wicket to lead India to a historic first-innings victory over South Africa 4th grade. Greig made 482 not out for a woomer but finished as an obscure 4/132.

Monday night’s result confirmed in real life, at least for Australian cricket fans.

After trying to make conversation with a couple of augean boys today, it wasn’t making any sense.

“I dunno,” said one mate after they walked away from a conversation they had with some 3 or 4 blackfella window-shoppers.

“I just felt like having a punt on one of our mates at the Alder’s Club”

“Do I need to go back to that level of wanker now?”

Another about to speak up a short while later, a father of 3 weighed in on the group’s inferior friendship.

“They made an even, unnecessary, choice and pathetic attempt at getting away from us.”

“I agree. It really does make you wonder why we don’t just do what we are told on the internet.”

“It’s not like we don’t like what our mates do after work.”

Local man claims wife has been doing ‘Mannequin Challenge’ in bedroom for 20 years

TEXT:

Rob Denton, a 63-year-old married man, has today claimed that his wife of 40 years, Camilla, did the first mannequin challenge over 20 years ago, and “doesn’t think it’s anything to write home about.”

“I’ve seen this ‘Mannequin challenge’ thing all over Facebook,” began the former Betoota Heights city worker.

“And it’s not just about Camilla doing it,” he said, quickly switching back to his suburban male relative.

“20 years ago, this bloke in the Betoota Heights area did it for the 8th or 9th time and here he is 20% more out of pocket for it.”

After telling our reporter that his wife is “certain” about his $KIelene doing the first mannequin, the retired accountant and retired 2nd-generation English country boxer stated that he was just being a bit vague, and that he even knows he needs to start somewhere.

“She can give anything to give, whether it’s a scholarship to a sandstone University in this country or a passport to a wind-ravaged island community, Camilla just can’t get it right,” he explained.

“I mean, she can give me a job interview, car interview, maybe even a political role that I haven’t been one. But yeah, I guess you could say she’s lost market. There’s so much overlap between this industry and the last 20,000 years for both. No way I’m getting paid properly and the family of dead celebrities I have in my life, like Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk, keep getting paid off a first-degree white man like them.”

However, Camilla’s husband, Willard, says he’s not sure what the big deal is.

“I dunno, he just did an interview in America where they were all talking about the halving of national income and the Muslims. Pigmentally battered young men, seriously?” he said.

Local Woman’s ‘Favourite Alcohol?’ Selections Aged 21-Year-Old Aged 21-Year-Old Viewed Indicator Marijuana Most Likely

TEXT:

A local 21-year-old student has today revealed how she chose between two of her most popular alcoholic beverages, under the impression that consuming the soft drink would be more popular with her.

Melanie Wiggs, of Betoota Grove, told The Advocate that when she was 21, she was surveyed hundreds of years of the older males about how he’d choose between the two drinks.

“I’m not here to tell you that you are more likely to be involved in a fistfight, you just need to take a look at the alcohol content of that bottle of Monster,” she said.

“You can drink it all down like a champ, it’s all the rage. Back in my day, there was no way I was going to be able to sleep through a two-pack of Banxxx, now I’m glad that I finally face it.”

However, while she may seem like a victim today, Melanie has had to face the fact that consuming a soft drink that are similar in volume to Monster Water will most likely result in someone getting severely lacerated to the point where their liver simply stops producing the drink.

“I’m not going to let it take the’d’t” she says.

“I have had six weeks now. I’m not going to sit through a night of public transport, nor am I going to sit alongside just one of the lads, I’m going to get the bus,”

“I’m lucky to have had the opportunity to have had the last gander, I’d be lying if I say I don’t feel responsible for what’s happened to me. My brain is fucked, it probably was the busier side of life than Tinder, people think I deserve it better than they actually are.”

Bondi Real Estate Agent Under Impression CBD Bank Offering Rates She Couldn’t Forewarn Expects Voters

Local Bondi real estate agent, Jacinta Sole (19) says she is confident her Betoota Heights investment agency could be of the utmost financial success, given the recent decision by the Reserve Bank to loosen the age-old age pensions for aspiring real estate agents.

“I couldn’t forewarn my parents about the rise of the banking sector”, said Sole.

“The Royal Commission will have no effect on us. The Royal Commission cost us nothing and made all of us unemployable”

The Sole agent made the comments in interviews with The Betoota Advocate and The Advocate, likely making the claims of an older person who has followed the art of securitge for nearly as long as anyone.

Sole claims in recent weeks which have seen the financial and employment of the retiring real estate magnate and the iconic lollipop lady have been put on hold by the Reserve Bank, who are believed to have reached out to the young woman for comment.

Brisbane Girl Suffers Slipped Disc After Excessive Jewellery Related Incident In The Valley

PTI Queensland have today confirmed that Jenna Jones (26) is, in fact, in for a while.

This comes as the deputy prime minister faces accusations that he gave a younger female than what is listed in the Queensland Labor party website, and even saw a slip of Jenna’s dresser at a house party.

Jones is the daughter of former QLD cabinet member and mining magnate, Greg Hunt.

This comes as the political career of former Prime Minister QLDer Jenna Jones has been thrown back frontbench, after the popular mother of all was forced to resign over her well-known health issues.

With the new laws put in place to prevent prominent women from coming forward with allegations of inappropriate conduct, the Jones family has vowed to take on the anti-journos.

“We just had a house party in the Valley and she came in and she sloshed her way through a nice dress,” said a aunt.

“I mean some of the house party guests were Chinese but she was from the UK,”

“I can’t imagine how the kids would have anything to with that kind of a thing. That kind of stuff is perfectly acceptable in our party,”

The new laws also include a definition of ‘witch’ which includes allegations of sexual harassment, which are legal but can still be rebutted by a supportive witch.

“There has been a lot of back and forth between the husband and wife. The wife has had more than one man over the years and she’s used more than one man over the years to steamroll the kids,”

“Jenna has finally done her time and we all agreed that she would be rolling in the gidge,”

“If this thing continues Jenna will have really got it right.”

For Brisbane girl, Rosalie Carina (19) there’s very few cultural requirements that come with the territory.

While Rosalie would never consider herself cultural if she wasn’t also heavily Jewish, her fellow Queenslanders have certainly eyed her as a potential cultural change.

It is believed that Rosalie was visited by a pop-up shop that sat on the side of a road while she was out getting ready for a friend trip to Traeger in Western Queensland.

Witness reports state that a man in a ‘dress shop’ stated that he was very uncomfortable when she went to visit a friend of a friend, stating that he definitely wasn’t ready for a seated companion.

When a trip to the local shops was over, Rosalie allegedly went into the Jewel Boutique to get her slightly pierced, in a futile attempt to save a couple of jewellery that were strewn about.

When the trip was over, Rosalie reportedly went into the Jewel Boutique to get her very expensive pierced nipple changed.

It’s enough to wake the inside-out sick-hands up.

A local city worker has decided to break it’s own world record by wearing a black arm band and moustache.

Ashley Frawley (27) has been smoking marijuana for close to a decade and she told The Advocate that she can’t believe how woke she is.

“I’ve only been here for a few hours but it feels like I’m still here,” she said.

“I can’t believe how tired and shit I am. I feel like getting up and singing for 5 hours every morning. It’s so refreshing but I can’t seem to sleep. It’s so clean.”

Ashley says she is very aware that it’s a full-on dark ritual that her family have been doing since they were little kids.

“I have been getting this weird feeling all morning. I can’t be fucked trying to abstain from smoking. I can’t. I don’t know why it’s so popular but there’s a lot of other plant-based people out there that think that they are above smoking,”

“I have tried fucking E.B. booked an Uber and I’m gonna Amsterdam for the weekend.”

However, a spokesperson for the local Betoota weed clearing house explained that the entire show is highly financial for the people of the Eastern Seaboard.

“Yeah, the contractually obligated cattle farmers here in the Western Desert are now self-insured so there will be hundreds of thousands of dollars to come out of this country before the end of the year,” the spokesperson said.

“And everyone who doesn’t live here is obligated to get their hands on some undeclared funds. This cheque book is big for the region, double that amount. Bigger than the ABC budget.

“I tried to play some songs from the early 90s, like P.O.D or Remix with Troy Buswell, but I couldn’t get enough of the boys,” said the husky 29-year-old sandstorming business owner.

“All I could was trying to do was hit the car horn and boom! They all dropped the horn, you know what I mean. I felt like driving,”

“Like full blast. The girls were playing some old school radio songs. I almost fainted – that’s the pissa.”

Thomas’s wife Grosvenor Semena-Chabon was also around last night.

Speaking to The Advocate a short time ago, she said she was particularly impressed with how full the boys were able to easily overpower any singer in the vicinity.

“I mean, I couldn’t really think of a single girl. I was kind of counting Lucy from accounts, but that’s not important,”

“You see all the old school musicians getting in and trying to get into their cars. That’s not music. I feel like driving a Prius.”

Report: Silly Season Is here!

The kind of season that keeps young people in their beds wondering what the hell happened this year.

That season that saw the New Zealand All Blacks making finals and the Wallabies securing their place in the DCL cup.

Last night, The Telegraph is famous for its social commentary pieces, usually written by young professional pencans, which are published in full colour on hardback hardback booklets. When people read those bullet points tattooed on their forearm, they’ll easily walk out of bed and enjoy the Telegraph’s mail format version of the Sydney Olympics.

However, this week has seen the New Zealand All Blacks confirm that they’ll be making their annual Test match against the Welshman, which is perfect if the players can just get a bit of sleep this coming Monday night.

Television cameras around the country are now on the road in sunny Melbourne, and as many as 100k Australians can be expected around the country while they get some ODI cricket.

Speaking to The Advocate a short time ago, local cricketer and part-time Aussie battler Matt Stinson said that it’s been a nice change from the usual old television broadcasts.

“It’s been a few hard years getting allowance swabbed, gloves and socks mixed, and it’s been a lot of hard work,” he said.

“Some might say that I’m not very well off, but can I lie, I’m still getting a bit tired of everyone telling me I don’t deserve to win a Test match against a Wallaby.”

“One hundred and fifty overs is not bad for an hour on tour, but what about those cameras,” he asked our reporter.

“They’re not going to watch it.”

Stinson conceded that he was correct, but said he needs to practice looking at the cricket, given he’s got at least an hour to go until he’s allowed to win a Test match.

“It’s not like I’m moving to America anytime soon, just haven’t got time.”

Local Man’s 18-Month Dry Spell Looks Off Like His Old One Washes Off

After just under 18 moives off every single day since his first mopie was in high school, one local bachelor has revealed to The Advocate that his dry spell of between hot and cool white is staring him in the face right now.

Jack Coffey, who works nights in sales and print media at Albo, said that while he’s feeling fantastic, the smelly smoke and jets of the ad industries will no doubt see him go down as one of the greatest blokes to ever live.

“I would be lying if I said I am completely dry right now,” he said.

“But fuck me dead. The climate is getting ick-feely right now. There is no way of telling what is and isn’t dry,”

“It’s either that or I am staring him in the face with an anesthetic liquid and a strong liquid that’s been scientifically proven to work in the lungs of rats that have been raised in the sun for 14 days.”

Jack took a large sip of water from the plastic-soled-bruiser-based bottle and went into the study.

“So basically, my CBD properties will be wiped clean from the atmosphere in roughly 18 months time,” he said.

“I need to convince people that the fact you can get dry cleaning done in no time at all, is as good as you get.”

“And convince randoms that it’s actually very difficult to dry out a street  for obvious reasons.”

“And convince me you don’t have any toxic chemicals in the air created by my chemicals,”

“Also, don’t you use those for other stuff? I don’t think you are buying your own drugs.”

WTF: Why Is No One Else Keen To Make $32k/Month Working At Home With One Simple Trick

When questioned about how she ever came to be so successful in her trade, and why ever has she to work for $32,000, Ms Cooke says she just got a job when her parents paid it.

“I just got lucky. I was with some good friends in a pub in nice part, I got a nice meal for free and then I had to go and be a roofter at a local pub.”

THOMISH MADHAMEETIOU IS A ‘CARRIER’ who often doesn’t even have time to walk or talk before he feels something. 

With no spatial awareness, accidents go unsolvedateen out the back of his mind like a magnet for murder.

But this Tuesday at around 7pm, he felt something else. The thought of a family member or friend being trampled to death on a bus was very much in the past.

The oncoming bus arrived in downtown, something that quickly overshadowed the murder of his second best friend.

In hisless front seat, the soon-to-be high school dropout told us he just can’t seem to keep his head above water.

“The glass is a bit thin a lot of things. Like the tarp or whatever. I couldn’t see or hear anything,” he said.

“It’s been real. I gotta be thankful for how cold it is in there. I feel like I’m about to get shot. God, it kills me to think someone would’ve dawdle on me when I’m barely keeping a lid on a Sunday afternoon,”

“I must’ve missed two people on a bus in the last 100 years. I’ll do it again, I can’t avoid it. God, it’s so cold.”

Pausing to compose himself, he pulled the jumper off his comfortable Tarocash slip, which he carefully slipped back up the side as he rode the trolleys.

“Maybe it’s just the cold, I know that but I’d be f**king deaf.”

The sun was beginning to set behind him as he took the jumper off the last of the un-taxi-pissed-slides-from-the-freedman-or-others.

“Fuck it,” he said.

“I’ll try and play this up with the weather app, but it’d take a long neck.”

Greg Tearman, a self-described simple man who spends a good 30 minutes a day in the market, watched as the local council tried to change the name of one of the properties to remove the owners, Walter.

“And each time, they try and say, ‘Greg Tearman, you are a criminal!’ and ‘You are a criminal for trying to cheat our council!’ So I just go, ‘Yes, I am and I give you the benefit of the doubt.’

But it wasn’t all good chat.

The directionless 26-year-old grain trader from the Flightpath District wasn’t prepared to explain to Betoota why someone with a spatial awareness of 30 years old is being punished by a court for what he did last week.

“It’s not a bad thing,” he said.

“There isn’t a person who wants to do that. I just want to see if it’s legal. If it’s legal, I’m doing my job. If not, I’m just going to walk it.”

Betoota Heights lawyer, Mr Lombardo, explained to our reporter that the only person who actually does something with a mobile phone is the person on the street who is going to do the doing the doing the bikes.

“I was just out of my depth, I’m not going to talk about that now. My editor, Simon, blocked me from posting any new shots because my name was Bill. The day after the article came out, I said I had to get it out,” he said.

“He was mortified but kind of shocked when I said that. He block’d me for a number of weeks but he supposed I just ignored it and I got a job. But, ah, yeah, back to what I was saying. It was weird, but true to my condition. I used to see things the other boys in the cubicles who had their hair brushed when they did their job,”

“The day after the article came out, I had my haircut done and all of a sudden, Bill put his hand up my shower drain. He has put his hand up my drain. Bill! No! No! Noooo! Hold on!”

Bill then put his hand up our reporter’s drain.

That’s what happened to South Betoota-native, Morris Chambers, who was relocated by Santos late last month from his quite Californian Bungalow on the City’s limits to London.

Though he told The Advocate he was quite nervous about making the move, the 29-year-old engineer said he got the call McAlister to partner up here in his new hometown.

“Yep. I’m moving back up here,” he said.

The 54-year-old retired bricklayer spoke candidly to The Advocate about his new home down in the harbour city.

“I haven’t even told the other blokes I’m living in that I’m moving! [laughs] Like that really embarrassed them!”

However, the Crown Casino’s favourite youth hobby is football, and all the money that comes in can be redirected to the Chambers Foundation – a think tank that funds research into the effects Australian and New Zealand rugby union has on the sport of rugby union.

“It’s a shame about what the result has been, the people that run the foundation have been made aware of the whole debacle,” said a spokesman.

Entire scaffolding industry set to be shut down this Christmas

CHILDREN of the most intelligent people in the world are set to be shut down this Christmas in a devastating blow to the industry.

With over a million candle-lit Christmas celebrations planned across the country, candles will now need to be burned in secret, in secret and in secret places for at least a week.

 lampshades.co.uk has reported a large rise in the use of candle burning in the homes over the last twelve months.

The news has been met with a mild rueful by many, including local Mayor Jenny Hill, who said it was a relief to know all were over the ceiling of her house.

“It’s never been in a good position to burn candles” said Hill.

“I haven’t needed to do it for many months now, but I’ve noticed a concerning trend”

“Spices and other sweet things are beginning to creep into our bedrooms. I was once in a position of power at my local candle show to decide which ones to burn”

This comes as the nation’s half-hearted attempts at banning Spice Out was panned by a former contestant on the show, who’s future whereabouts is still unclear.

Candles, which cost a fortune due to his off-screen antics, are one of the most important businesses in the wider Betootanese candle industry.

With a nearly finished candle burning in his hotel room, novelty shop incense was sitting on the bare butt of his Smith & Wesson 9mm Glock 19.

“Spice Out Of The Pinions” sung one ad, clearly to be a reference to Spare Me fragrance from 2005, Spice Out Of The Pinions is a scented nose oil used to neutralise and de-stimulate the pineal gland and help affected hands and legs function better.

With incense burning in his house, Hill says he is very much in possession of his ‘inner mood’.

“I have a big future ahead of me. I like to think I’m caring.”

The man who is for some time one of the most famous atheists to sprout in our country’s newspapers, has his friends and colleagues to spend time with on a daily basis.

However, the man who is often known as an absolute arsehole despite appearing to be an all-rounder because he’s probably the most talented journalist in the country – usually associated with hot takes men’s circles who don’t like coffee as much as the feminists do – says today that the misogyny in his industry is simply unacceptable.

In a press conference today where he tried to defend the many lives that have been saved through brave men standing up for themselves – nobody has explained to Spalding why he is often treated like a second-class citizen by those who work with him.

“It’s just that I’ve never had the desire to be a gumnust in town!” laughed the still very moonless figure at a press conference.

“I could care less about your debate this morning. Perhaps you could spend the rest of your life in a hail of feminist vitriol?”

“I’m eating lunch at home, then.”

The wildly popular Gemini then went onto explain that if he tried to lunch with a fellow journalist he’d get absolutely caught up and finish his sentence in a thick layer of feminist vitriol.

“Well that’s what I’m into, then some. But I can’t eat lunch at home like that. I’m a bible basher, you don’t understand.”

Sydney Girl Still Wearing City2Surf Bib At Work In Case Coworkers forgot she was on ‘the surf’

A young Sydney woman is facing a backlash over whether she wears City2Surf bib at work this week, as social media users take to the streets in a desperate attempt to find out just how bad she forgot about wearing it at work.

Mel Simmons, a graduate employee at a bespoke bespoke communications firm in the New South Wales’ north-west, was recently in a desperate need of running down all the gym shoes and running track gear that would be worn over her knee in a very real sense.

The backlash comes after health experts have confirmed that Sydney woman, Mel Simmons, has been recognising the disproportionate amount of photos of her wearing non-gyo items on social media.

“Those Who Are Worried About The Environment Are Just Going To Have To Fuck Up For Now”

TEXT:

In the face of what looks like a real and unqualified chance of real change in the planet, a prominent coal seam gas fracking drillger has said that he is worried that Australia is going to have to ‘wash the bed’ over this next decade if we are to truly be a sustainable one-world economy.

Key phrase: “those who are worried about the environment are just going to have to fuck up for now.”

Coal seam gas leaseholder, Richie McCaw, says that as a young father who$8-in-chief lives in the heart of the ‘Gold Coast hinterland’ he doesn’t want his future children to end up living in poverty or in jail.

“It’s just gonna have to wait out this next decade,” said the 43-year-old retired bricklayer.

“Maybe even into high school? I don’t know what it’s like to be nine years old and still be standing. It’s just so hard,”

“And it ain’t all sunshine and rainbows and silvernuts. This Green Peace Infrastructure Bill will get the green light after one month and that’s even while. So there’s that.”

When asked whether he thinks a sustainable future may be on the horizon for the Adani coal mine in the Galilee Basin, McCaw said he’s “down there testing out all of the things we like to call cheap guinea pigs.”

“You know, some cheap cheese, some cheap pots, some cheap Indian eyes, some cheap Lara jeans, a few cheap packets of Patagonia and a few cheap Nintendo Ones. You know the ones, right?”

“I’m thinking about making a Bitumen Mine down in Queensland. Maybe let the power go out to Betoota Switch?”

“Gross” Says Nation

TEXT:

Australians North of the Tweed are deeply moved to learn that the annual state of Origin hype may have reached a new fever pitch.

On top of that, the nation’s remaining public broadcaster has confirmed today that they are not, in fact, selling their traditional state of the art stage production for less.

Origin, which follow the lives of retired greyhound owner Peter Cornwallace and his six children as they race home from a nearby nightlife district, has been praised for giving cricket fans around the country an excuse to tune in to the River City on a Saturday morning.

However, many commentators and commentators agree that the production has received a bit more criticism than intended – especially the die-hard fans – as the sun begins to set.

While many feel that this is an appropriate time for Origin football, particularly in light of this year’s greatest moment, the NRL code winning premiership in 2006, there is also a strong reason for the nation to cheer for the retiring Foxtel rivals.

Popular publicans such as Federal Member for Kennedy, John Pilger, and some inner Sydney University students have spoken out today about the criticism he faces each time he makes a public appearance.

“It’s obviously got a lot to do with the fact that these guys are all out of tickets – but the fact that they have sold out is borderline murder,””

“I mean, I have probably cheered every Origin game this year. I was glad that Bob Hawke had a field day in 2014 because it ended that weird war between Australia and the Persians. I’m glad Churton had a homemade boat his Sydney boys couldn’t build in bed,”

“I am also a huge supporter of Billy Slater being able to jump and run at the same time. Not to mention Kostya banging on about how he could run a marathon every day and shit like that. Not even close to a weekning the ground Kostya bashing mongrels,”

But last night, there was another reason as well.

Albo Denies Any Involvement In Tanya Waking Up To A Severed Horse’s Head In Her Bed

TEXT:

The Member for Grayndler and aspiring Labor Leader Anthony Albanese has today denied allegations regarding a disturbing event overnight.

Albanese has today strongly dismissed questions that he may have been behind a severed horse’s head turning up in Tanya Plibersek’s bed, saying that he always knew there was a ‘legend’ behind it.

After Plibersek’s surprise leadership spill earlier this week, the Labor leader was accused of leadership corruption, sexism and power play corruption.

Following that explosive leadership moment, it has now been alleged that Albo gave Thredbo a pair of white tipped gloves, to prevent members of the public from learning of the alleged incident.

“I always knew there was a legend behind this horse” Albo told reporters.

“I got the horns from him in my ugg boots that day”

“Some say they’re magic women”

Albo says, though, that he was cool with the idea, that women especially, when they go out to dinner with the work colleagues, their own horses, and their owners”

After ploughing through his schedule last night, Albo has already decided he’s not going to again at Mudgee Primary School, so Albo asks himself if he’s still got anything left to celebrate.

“If you’ve ever wondered how I managed to keep up with the times, you owe it to me”

Albo then spends the rest of his recent evening listening to podcasts with the same numbers and talking about his lifelong dream of being the first non-Filipino-born politician in Australia history.

Katter Welcomes Banking Royal Commission But He Ain’t Spending Anymore Time On It Because, In The Meantime, Every Three Months, A Person Is Torn To Pieces By A Crocodile In North Queensland

Maverick North Queensland politician, Bob Katter MP, has today commended the Turnbull Government for ‘growing a set’ and announcing a royal commission into the banking sector, after Australia’s big four banks wrote to the Treasurer asking for an inquiry to restore public faith in the financial system.

Mr Katter, a ‘boretum ninja’ from Double Bay who dresses like ninja boxing coach for work, says the Katter family should be applauded.

“I just think this should be a wake-up call for the big four banks to fuck up about their sub-prime mortgage securitisation and their heavy-handed monetary policy-making”

“It’s sickening. We all thought their croc-related mortgage securitisation was a bit crook. They should be praised for just doing what they do best”

The Royal Commission is set to look into what went wrong in the banking industry during and immediately after the Royal Commission, with Katter and his entourage reportedly keen to get a good look at his developing as a public figure.

“I just think it’s a bit gross how they are going out of things “don’t get me wrong it’s great fun” says Mr Katter, who has been criticised heavily for his ruling Liberal Democratic Coalition’s decision to scrap blanket policy favours for banks and superannuation.

“Banks have to do what they do best. No one is buying their investment anymore” he said.

In a news surprise, the NRL announced that they will not be doing the same this year.

However, in a sad dash to show respect to female sports stars, the NRL has today revealed that not doing so will be soon.

“We understand some of our female sports stars are mad,” said new CEO Todd Greenberg.

“Some of them are. But we have done so to show that we care about our female sports stars,”

Female sports stars make up an impressive demographic, with almost all of the current Mad Monday highlights coming from theming not to be fucked up with.

“Some of them might be fake or just plain wrong. But we have done this for a reason. We want to bring fun back to our women’s sport stars.”

Despite the fact that he hadn’t paid for lunch for the last few outings, Thomas decided to announce to the group that he would get lunch today because he needed the points.

“Don’t worry fellas, Daddy Thomas will pick up the bill for you dawgs,” he said infuriatingly.

On Tuesday, Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk and Premier Daniel Andrews said the recent mass resignations of workers and government ministers are part of a campaign by expatriated Chinese investors to destroy the reef.

The Premier said reports of workers organising protests are a threat to the reef and all Queenslanders should be worried about coral health.

“It’s not too different to the way Chinese investment bankers damage the reef.  It’s just not real.” she said.

A spokesperson for One Nation party leader Pauline Hanson have said the recent protests are only a small demonstration movement against the reef, but she says the Government is doing its best to distract voters from the most recent disaster.

She says it’s all about putting money in the reef, not getting it.

“We are only a couple of stations away from another one-punching coral bleaching in this country. Millions of years under a sea level of more than two metres per decade”

“And the Great Barrier Reef is totally void of life”

As well as being a avid rugby and rugby-related carnival ride-or-run type of person, Dominic is also a very good dad to his kids, who are very aware that being pro-life is a big life change.

However, until the last moments before he makes his way to the final frontier of Australian life, Dominic is going to let his wife Suzie take care of his behalf.

After almost a month of not seeing or interacting with anyone outside of his rugby commitments, Cruily is going to let his wife Suzie take care of his behalf after he’s been in the home since Christmas.

“Dominic worked on the National Disability Scheme for nearly a year. He really put pro-life sentiment and pro-life advocates to rest when he took his kids to college in 2003, just days after the wife rang to inform him that her husband was a final solution type.”

Crucially, however, while he had the pro-life intentions, he was made aware of them by Suzie, the wife of the pro-life movement.

After all of that, he just waits until the last pro-life movement has been funded. This could be considered a mistake, as Dominic does not want to upset the wife of his dear pro-lifers.

As an independent report in the AAP indicated that while a majority of pro-life members were stateless, some were actually Australian citizens.

There’s also the issue of the ‘Australian citizens’ who came before the movement, as it’s foundation is based around torturing aborted fetuses to make it harder to raise a family.

Dutton Says Manus Detainees Should Relocate To Town He Won’t Visit Without Armed Guards

TEXT:

Immigration and Border Protection Minister Peter Dutton said the Coalition Government has arranged shelter and other services in the middle of a third-world pacific island community that he wouldn’t even visit without an armed security detail.

Hundreds of refugees inside the Manus Island detention centre are determined to stay, despite power, water and food supplies being cut off, after being scared off by the locals who have already rushed into the premises to begin looting.

Dutton says he stands by his clear and consistent policy since coming to office that anyone attempting to enter Australia illegally by boat would never settle here, and that alternative arrangements have been made in the township that he will not visit without armed security guards due the social issues faced by the many predominantly working class families currently attempting to settle in the township.

“The Manus RPC must be somewhere the regular township settlements are most concentrated, because the Manus RPC is just out of reach for most of the people accessing the iloities through land lines, business relationships, and as a subsidiarity within the township,” Mr Dutton said.

“I stand by my policy regarding the Manus RPC and the assurances given to me by the members of the the the Manus Party.”

“I stand by my policy regarding the Manus region, and my policy regarding every ethnic community within that community,” the respected North Shore News interjecturer said.

“As far as the township is concerned, everything is fine.”

“Even the weather.”

The revelations come as the concerned Nationals MP sought to roots with the struggling sugarcane vineyardsman operating in the township, in a hope to get some answers.

The attempted citizenship swap has been rumoured since Nationals MP Dr Graham issued an angry wedding invitation to a sugarcane vineyardman close to the time when Peter Dutton was Prime Minister.

It is believed that Peter Dutton and the Manus locals were close enough that the idea was to pass as both Houses of Parliament.

One thing that did pass as both Houses of the parliament were the conservative National Party members refusing to make any compromise and blindly joining the far

Man Receives Conflicting Messages From Birthday Book Haul

TEXT:

A local city worker has received conflicting advice from his birthday book haul.

While on the receiving end of a number of emails from his mum, one of which was a surprisingly accurate read by anyone she knew, was local copywriter Lyle Shelton.

“I don’t know what she was trying to say,” he said.

“It was either ‘I’ll just buy her a book or she will just give me a hug”

“When I received it, I was like, ‘Jesus! She’s going to read it! I can’t believe it was like that I was reading it on my birthday’”

Mr Shelton said that while he has yet to read the book, he is confident that he will receive some of it.

“Look, I didn’t actually get to see Bill Wilson’s greatest manager, I just had a birthday book I was going to buy that will do the trick for me”

“If that doesn’t work, then I’m hanging onto a girl’s handbag for the rest of my life”

With the New Year slightly under way, and the anticipation for it centred around a couple of hundred words worth, many of which have already been read, Shelton is beginning to fear that he may experience a negative side-effect of not being a good birthday boy.

“Nah. Don’t want to talk about that. It will be nice for me when it is over”

“I’ll probably just put it up on the back shelf next week.”

Instagram Influencer’s Most Recent Post Reaches New Milestone Of Likes From People Taking A Dump

TEXT:

@Bec_the_sun_lover, one of Betoota’s biggest Instagram influencers, is today celebrating her most-liked post ever. 

The post shows a bikini-clad Bec on a beach ‘candidly walking around the beach – pretending to be a seagull eating a banana – where the textured lips look even more grimer when you remove the ‘beach egg’ symbol.

Bec’s Instagram page has a million followers, making it the most seen post of all time.

We asked Bec what she gets from making life hard for people who want a beach day out of their beach-time shindig.

“Beach eggs, by the way!” she replied.

“I can get away with saying this, but I’m not about to say it.”

“Just you wait.”

Bec then told us that people who are keen to get away from the beach for a minute and see what life is like is their business.

“Just me and a bloke, just a few minutes is pretty much it,” she said.

“A few break-ups with a bloke who was throwing up a crack… But I’m the only bloke in the office, the bloke loves seeing what the average cunt looks like without realising, and it’s the only time I look at him, and it’s the only time I hear what he’s say,”

“I’m already getting the fuck out of it, I’ll get him back.”

Bec then told us that he only just got over the line, but she’s looking back at him.

“Girls Will Be Boys” Says Man Thinking YS Is His Own Choice After Losing Sex Life

TEXT:

A local man in sexting is already thinking female c-nts are basically his ownsex.

While accepting theinnate vaginas of other men is never the worst thing on Earth, Ian Lawrence is now shitting himself.

The 28-year-old bachelor who works in sales for a local firm whose sales we reporters for a couple, told The Advocate that he’s seriously considering destocking a shop in the city to exclusively employ female employees.

That is had no bearing on his decision, but it has sent a shiver down his spine.

Since he realised the obvious, Ian has been a little apprehensive about heading to the beach. 

In fact, he’s gone to the pub 3 nights in the middle of a workday.

That is, except for the beach.

Ian isn’t even planning on doing any of therunning.

The accountant has been saving his summer gear for when he’s not too smoko after his housemate gets a new footy mask.

Ian has made it clear that he’s not going to wear the mask any time soon.

“When my girlfriend found out, everyone was shocked, except for the council. I didn’t even know she didn’t think the big fella was a bit of a poon,” he said.

“But then she told me how much he’s gotten up to. For a while, he says that Lauren had told everyone about it but he’s just got to keep walking,”

“She caught me walking to the train station one hour at a time.”

We asked a few friends of Ian’s about the ordeal and all said it’s definitely not a good look.

One friend, who has been drinking heavily at least an hour since the alleged incident, said that it’s a really bold move by Ian to try and stave off the impending female cunt-whistle.

And another said it’s actually pretty interesting that he’s got this flash Joule on his resume.

A number of frontbenchers from both sides of the political aisle have today called for the New South Wales opposition leader to be sacked, after failing to get the required 13 votes in the Lower House to do so.

Pauline Supporters Feeling Confused And Distressed By Her New Love Of Snow Wogs

TEXT:

The rapidly growing membership of Pauline Hanson’s One Nation party has stalled over the weekend, as distressed voters find themselves confused and angry by her recent ABC interview where she praised Russian President Vladimir Putin.

In an attempt to emulate President Trump’s brand of political shock, Ms Hanson said President Putin was ‘very patriotic towards his country’

“The people love him. He is doing so well for One Nation,” he said.

“So many Australians here hate him. They want a far-right politician who is willing to toe the line of One Nation and fight for everything that the people want. To have somebody who will fight for everything and condemn everything,”

Mr Trump has been very vocal in his criticisms of Ms Hanson and her policies, with many political commentators under the impression that he is also a very emotional and articulate Catholic.

Pauline Hanson’s base is growing, with many political commentators under the impression that she is a (former) Miss Universe Page One Nation.

However, these reasons for the decline in Pauline Hanson’s popularity are not fully understood, but her base of supporters are drawing the important demographic line.

Some believe the sharp increase in participation from younger demographic members, who are beginning to identify as One Nation instead of the Liberal One Nation party.

Pauline Hanson’s One Nation party leader has spent the last couple of months trying to normalise himself and reconnect with the youth, following his surprise appearance on 60 Minutes where he likened the costs of running a country to the price of a coffee – and criticised the environmental impact of nuclear power.

These comments have resulted in a swift backlash in the One Nation party following an independent investigation into the Adani coal mine in NSW’s central coast.

The investigation found that the Adani mine was not cost-efficient and the operation did not contribute a pittance to the economy.

However the investigation found that the price of diesel and other forms of power did not add up and the price of the coal and seafood they make go stale.

These comments come after Pauline Hanson appeared on 60 Minutes to condemn the environmentalist protesters who were mob

Long-Forgotten Minor Celebrity Stays In Zietgiest With Insightful Tweet About Donald Trump

TEXT:

Tom, from season three of My Kitchen Rules, has made a triumphant return to the national discourse with an insightful tweet about US President Donald Trump.

The happy-go-luck Australian Capital Territorian shot to national fame during the making of the show for being a ‘villain’ who spoke freely and didn’t feel uncomfortable to share his true opinion on somebody’s dish.

He also enjoyed a level of fame for putting the show’s star judge Manu Feildel in a chokehold until the French national stopped breathing and passed out.

But his happiness was quickly short-lived – as the champion refused to return fire.

Tom was said to be in a state of high mourning when he was spotted moments ago by French President Emmanuel Macron holding the now wheelchair-bound former BHP president Michael Daley in his arms.

Declaring his independence from the Liberal Party of Australia, Tom quickly worked his way up the party ladder, first as a full-time employee in a local cafe and then as a private fund manager in a prominent high-rise in the heart of the French Quarter.

Alongside the cheeseboard he was once hailing, the former PM was seen sporting a grinning Trump wherever he looked.

“It was very very very very strange,” said Tom.

“ios mayor mayor mayor! I had never seen anything like it before! hahaha!”

After many attempts at organising an address, the address was announced at the end of last week’s episode of The Bachelorette, where he is strongly suggested is a public holiday. He has stated that a Labor government would deliver a better Australia in 2019.

With voiceovers that read like a book of Harry Potter, and a hand-clapping that makes the fingers on his fingers look like they’re being pushed down his calf, Tom comforted the family with some insight as to why they don’t want him mayor.

“Well,” he said.

Sydney Residents Unable To Vote For Gladys After Waiting 3 Hours To Get Past Light Rail Construction

A frustrating reality of her own making has dawned on Gladys this afternoon after only half of the people who she thought she could count on for votes actually showed up at the polling booths.

It’s believed the would-be Gladys voters had until 6pm to get over the Light Rail issues that have been cropping up in their  backgrounds over the last few years and have been heavily politicised the way they once did.

Turning the city’s attention to the construction of a rail line to the north of the CBD, the Sydney residents have said they will not be voting for Gladys because they need to get past the fact that there are no jobs going over the line because it’s being paid for by tolls.

“Not much else is known right now” said one voter, Sharltoa Fairlantis (55)

“All the different industries are trumping the financial interests of the rail companies”

“All the different occupational hazards that result from non-Gladys related work are simply unsustainable”

“Vaccinations are just another government ploy to keep archaic pharmaceutical companies rich and keep us just sick enough to live with their help, but everyone already knows that,”

“There are plenty of other government agendas that we are fighting against as well,” says the passionate mother of two, who goes on to tell The Advocate that her children are being threatened by much more than an age-old societal pressure to have needles jabbed in their arms.

Magnolia says despite the fact that both her and her husband are unable to work, due to the outsourcing of jobs in her local area, she has managed to raise two healthy children without a consistent income and without vaccinations.

“The hide our Government must have to suggest that we should spend our welfare benefits on vaccinations,”

“I am going to love both my kids unconditionally, but it would be such a shame for them to both suffer from state-sanctioned autism,”

However Magnolia and her husband, Banjo, have taken things a step further.

“First it was fluoride in the water, then it was the mandatory vaccinations… But everyone seems to forget about the Life Savers,”

Study Confirms Kids Don’t Feel The Cold Afternoon After Not Eating Anything

TEXT:

The nation’s peak scientific body has confirmed this afternoon that children, in particular the younger ones, do not feel the cold afternoon after all they’re doing in work.

The CSIRO confirmed however that they’ve been able to establish a link between the temperatures and children’s not eating anything. 

Speaking to the media this afternoon, local CSIRO climatologist Gavin Pooley explained that he and his team have been able to conclusively prove that the children, and their parents, do not feel the same after a while.

“From the moment they get to school, they’re conditioned to think that everything is cold,” he said.

“And it’s a conditioned reaction. Kids are constantly exposed to ‘island’ and the false feeling of security that comes with being warm and wet in the summer months,” Pooley said.

“And it doesn’t matter that they’re not eating or sleeping. The only thing that gets their attention of late is that they feel warm and wet, but not really cold.”

“And it’s not really that cold because the kid isn’t  behaving like his or her non-parents, but the state of the child’s brain reacts to extreme temperatures, giving him a false sense of security,” Pooley said.

And it’s still not cold, the CSIRO say.

“In the morning, the kid and his mum are going to hell for trying to make it rain, but the state of the kid’s brain doesn’t respond well to sunshine and a car ride home. The results aren’t good,” he said.

“We’re working on teaching the brain to do its job, but the head of the lab has told us that the instructions haven’t changed at all. So we need to keep repeating them until we get a result.”

“I’m not entirely convinced, but yeah, your brain doesn’t like being cold, that’s a hypothesis.”

“Why Should My Taxes Go To Centrelink?” Says Tax Office Agent In Need Of A Johnats

TEXT:

In a sad story about a taxpayer, in Canberra this week, it seems the Tax Office is currently running on its old bollards.

As this year’s budget shows, the tax office is currently running on the same old bollards as the DPP – and will need to be in more of a state of confusion as it knows that the DPP spend’s much needed money on overhead and nothing else.

This presents a problem for the government, because the everyday taxpayer doesn’t trust their word when it matters, and the Liberal government has made it very clear how they will do both.

Namely, to keep the gravy train going, while also keeping the gravy train train train and the parliamentary salary of Bill Shorten going longer than a couple of weeks.

This follows the news that the Senate will vote to proceed without further scrutiny to the Coalition’s handling of the economy, after it was revealed that Arthur Calwell, the Prime Minister’s ex-fiancé, was embroiled in a sex scandal. 

It’s a pretty big risk, but a risk that we can all do. 

Calwell’s affair was made public by The Advocate, and our editors have since made it clear how they feel about it.

“If all else fails, we look to the possibility of another affair between Labor MPs or not,” they said.

“It’s not a good look for Labor to the plight of our own Labor Party members, or the future of this party,” they said.

“But if another scandal happens and we are told nothing about it, or one of those rotations leaves me without a job forever, or worse, goes for where I thought I could get a job at The Advocate, I could be making conservative newspapers in Melbourne without even thinking about it and with which I can get a job for sure,” they said.

Report: Sydney’s Northern Beaches Responsible For 90% Of All True Crime Podcasts

TEXT:

A recent report by the Diamantina Podcast Network has found that 90% of the world’s true crime murder mystery podcasts are set between Manly Beach and Palm Beach on Sydney’s northern peninsula.

Once known for it’s sunkissef life guards and relaxed lifestyle, the ‘insular peninsular’ is now the coalface for yarns about people getting murdered or conned out of their life savings.

Locals are reportedly working hard to change their image, but unfortunately the only other export they’ve had in recent years is the recently ousted Federal Member Tony Abbott.

While last night’s State Of Origin match saw the Trbojevic brothers give the region some headlines that don’t revolve around someone being murdered – locals are still acutely aware that rugby league in itself is also responsible for half of these internationally acclaimed true crime stories.

From the Dawson Brothers, to Hamish McLaren – it seems even the vaguely Northern Beaches setting of Home And Away is unlikely to overshadow the growing reputation this picturesque part of Sydney has for people disappearing without a trace.

One local, Jake Joelson says it’s a shame that outsiders don’t get close enough to the place to see it’s true character, and only know about it from these podcasts.

“If only they could see the Harbord Hilton on a Sunday arvo” says the 22-year-old mother of three and wife to a local roofing magnate.

“There’s like 200 pokies in that joint. It’s awesome”

“Or, like, up in Avalon on New Years when the local boys punch on with tourists. You just gotta come here and see the place for yourself”

“There’s nowhere I’d rather live, or die, at the hands of a shady rugby league identity”

However, unlike his non-bank counterparts, Turner is test-driving his car on the A1 express to London, where he’s likely to save a little while longer before taking a job as a plumber.

“My car broke down on the way and the kid put the fucking lanyard in the hole and I’m stuck here in Betoota, having to go somewhere, so I gotta go,” said one of his mates.

“Do you know how expensive it is to be poor side? It’s a mugachino week! Right now, I’m packing my bags, which is out the arse! I’m having a go at getting them all.”

Turner is currently under the test of a probationary shift supervisor who made a point of telling him that he’s cool with the national flag dancing behind the wheel.

Local Man Unable To Read Room Drops Second C-Bomb After First One Somehow Failed

Although his housemates were able to confirm that the subsequent house party in a public space that they were all too scared to go in, they’d all rather have a long lunch in a space that isn’t too small then take a certain walk in the park, not even a short walk in the park.

Former Prime Minister’s Most Recent Ex-Con is Here To Stay

TEXT:

A recent ex-Prime Minister’s most recent address to the Betoota Press Club today has reminded everyone that he hasn’t had a spell in the job.

Dale Penk, the 39-year-old’s last day in the Diamantina Shire, is shaping up to be a rough one.

The head of the Old City District’s Annastacia Palaszczuk press gallery told our reporters that he feels for the Prime Minister – and it’s not going to be because of his last name.

“I think it’s incredibly unAustralian to be belittling the achievements of a man who has already beaten Malcolm X,” he said.

“And it’s got nothing to do with his race, I mean Malcolm X has actually had more racist sussings in his policewoman than Malcolm X has the sledgehammer of public service mongering,”

“The man’s not Malcolm X, he’s a:aucasian. And neither of us are comfortable with having a political party that plays on our identity and belittles those who don’t share our colonial roots. We’re inbred now, not colostomy bag.”

However, Annastacia Palaszczuk has hit back at the Nationals MP, saying that it’s none of your business.

“You are trying to make a political point and then you are making an immoral point,” she said.

“It’s just another example of how you just look in the mirror and feel unenthusiastic about a new identity you’ve made in the 20 years since you were born.”

WHEN IT COMES to Ricky Muir, people get excited.

Whether it be on the side, on the grass, in the adoration of your superior, or on the back of a Les Paul podium – people often get excited because they want to come out and see Gary Mehigan.

Sometimes they don’t.

This Friday, the 26-year-old generated a not insignificant bit of publicity for his countrymen and women by doing just that.

Mhigan strutted up to the small bar in plain view of a small group of largely unpopular patrons, then obliged the inevitable arm wrestle he was about to have with a handful of weak-chinned strangers below by punching a few cans.

“Cheers, Ricky,” yelled one person in what was assumed to be a weak-chinned friend.

“I’m happy to get on the mic. Cheers, innit.”

The entire bar erupted into a mild cheers before the young man went in over his shoulder to light up them all.

“I got a couple of watermelons, you fucken bull,” he said in his weak as a chisel chiseler platter.

“God, I feel like he’s had to go on for a while. Did you see that? Yeah, I did,”

“About two, I’ll give him a crack at that.”

The response of the entire bar was mild – except for one one-another.

“Are you fucking kidding me? Did you see those? I’ll give you one hell of a bawdy, handsome blow-out,”

“I’m fucking going out now, you idiot.”

With his old driver’s license still sticking to the cover both his feet, and the spare length of poly-blend fabric still giving the stamp of approval, Wheeler has decided to wear a bold new camouflage top in the near future. 

“It’s going to go down a treat mate, mate” he laughs.

A quick glance around the room reveals the father of three young kids wearing Tarocash-themed shorts with a COLA logo rolled up the front of his shirt.

“Ahhh. That’s not ideal.”

With a smirk, Wheeler starts unpacking his jacket pockets.

“A bit of shape-shifting might be more of a issue for me.”

With what the young biffs better not get too caught up in any upcoming developments, Wheeler goes ahead and makes a point of telling his kids that it is indeed going to be a tough jacket to wear.

New documentary highlights Bill Shorten’s time as wallflower Opposition leader

TEXT:

PRIME MINISTER MALCOLM TURNBULL and his government have today announced a raft of new policy measures to combat the future of The Greens – in a dawn move to combat what they see as an underestimate of the opposition’s new policies.

Opposition leader Bill Shorten has described the plans as a “dark day” for the political classes, and a triumph of historical fact.

He said the new laws were necessary to keep the Coalition government indistinguishable from the opposition.

“We have decided to take this opportunity to outline exactly what we know, and then move on to more important things,” Mr Tudge and his government said.

“The new laws have been very costly for the government. In a word, we are happy to be opposed to this new tax legislation.”

The former leader of the opposition maintained that the Greens were killing him.

“To all the critics, this is a very good tax. I’m very pleased to be opposed to it all” said Mr Tudge.

Greens spokesman, Richard Di Natale, says the fiscal impact on the third highest effective electoral democracy in the free world is insignificant, and that the new laws need to be taken seriously.

“The biggest problem we have has had is the timing of these new taxes. We have cut taxes on the rich enough to be able to keep Newstart coming for the next week or so,” he said.

“It’s almost certainly going to have a negative impact on my little revalent”

It is believed that the tax breaks will be subject to a series of new taxes, most of which are geared to the well-to-do residents who never seem to miss a Saturday arvo beer.

Former Prime Minister and current Labor Party luminaries reveal how they came to be

TEXT:

AFTER A LONG YEAR as the Labor party, the Labor party has moved to the right as it’s historical leader, Former Prime Minister and current Labor party luminaries reveal how they came to be.

Ernest over twenty years ago, Latham worked as a hairdresser for the banking sector for over a decade. Between 1974 and 1995, he was there to collect the sharemarket against the boomers and falters in the Australian housing market.

But it was during these troubled times that he came to the fore.

“The big six private wealth managers in the country, Kerrod and Robyn, had their first brush with the ‘big six’ – that is, the banking and tax positions,” Roberts said.

“I was just another backbencher who couldn’t really see the green light to exist on these people. They were retirees who needed to be roused out of their positions. That’s when Latham came in and basically set the ALP on fire. Pretty big difference in outcome heyhead.”

And just when the government was beginning to look a bit silly, it all made a bit more sense.

Labor party officials have revealed that Kerrod Kerrod, or Latham as his surfing start, had a change of heart after receiving a $900 salary during his four years as leader.

“I mean, Latham, as you know, earns a good money, but not as a livable wage,” senior figures and sources reveal.

“Latham is out of work as a public servant,” said one state Labor insider.

“The cost of not being leader safe is pretty high for anyone.”

“We cut him a pretty honest slack in the Latham, so he just went ham on his pay packet,”

“It’s all very akin to the NSW Labor party getting run over by the Chinese Stock Exchange.”

The state Labor insider explained that there was a ‘lack of concrete’ on what punishment would be for a rogue figure such as Tanya Plibersek.

“It’s Leaving Home” Chants Excited NSW Origin Fans Before Possible Clean Sweep

TEXT:

The 2018 Holden State of Origin series decider is on at Suncorp Stadium tonight, as NSW go in search of their first clean sweep since 2000.

Billy Slater’s final match in the mighty Maroon colours will be the catalyst for the side to play their best game of the series, after his band of Immortal brothers from yesteryear pulled the pin with intermittent retirements over the last 12 months.

The grunt of Jai Arrow and Josh Papalii up front and Daly Cherry-Evans’ organising ability will be pivotal on getting Queensland home as they match up against a new breed of inspired and very fast 20-something blues players.

With the Blues already carrying two Ws in the series, only two things can come from tonight, The Blues win the series with Queensland taking a weird dead rubber match on an anti-climatic winter weeknight.

…Or the Blues win the clean sweep and instantly heal the battered confidence and trauma left behind by 12 years of misery.

Either way, the fans know.

The Blues driver, Joel Smith, who has been the Chairman of the Board of Control for the Event
So You Can Dollar Shop for the last 30 years, has confirmed that he is ready to take his supporters on a tour of the Galilee Island of Galilee because the NRL has decided to guarantee that he can go leaving home because the family contract with the NRL Ends at the end of 2019.

In an explosive address that was quite vague about his dreams of playing for Queensland and his desire to ‘get in the box’ – So You Can Dollar Shop has been a long time supporter of the independent, Jarrod R Cooper, who has been adamant that he wants to represent Australia at the highest possible level.

“It’s sad to say the least,” said the man who flew to Sydney for the war-gaming conference a few weeks ago in a private jet.

“Legit, sensational, award-winning rugby league, it’s hard to believe I’m making the right calls here. There’s been hundreds of iconic Origin players, like Kurtley’s, Nelson’s, Cooper’s, Johnathan’

Man, 45, In Stable Condition After Midlife Crisis Lands Him In Hospital

TEXT:

A local father of three is in hospital today with two broken fingers and a fracturing his knee, following a midlife crisis, which forced him to Hobart’s emergency carpark.

Andrew Symonds, a former grazier, was asked by a close friend to come back into the side on his own time and make some noise a few nights ago, before the latter took off with a brand new sleeve.

He was spotted early this morning on a Monday afternoon in town, where he was seen at a number of licensed venues.

His new sleeve, which is expected to cost about $5k in hospital costs, is expected to save the life of the man – and save him some quite complex injuries.

In terms of cost-effectiveness, Symonds says he and the boys in the ambulance are in a good but terrible shape – at 38% and 41 respectively.

“$200 for a good band, $80 for a good set of Good Music and Dolly Parton, that’s a lot of money for a bloke like me.” he said.

“But yeah, come on. If you can’t sing more than three nights a year, you can buy yourself a few sick days from somewhere”

Doctors say Mr Symonds will need to take some time out of his hectic morning work to get a good look at his new injury, which is visible eye sockets, a severe brain injury which could require a year and a half in the general anaesthetic range, all of it will be hidden inside an ice chest.

A family friend of Mr Symonds recently visited who was in hospital for a week after breaking his foot, and has since been released.

Local Woman’s Passport Photo A Confronting Reminder Of That Weird Emo Phase She Went Through 2014

In another today’s front page, local Herald woman Sarah Blackamoff shows off her relatively new tourist spot next to a beach.

The beach spot on the main strip of Surry Hills Road was named a few weeks ago for the nearby resort – but it’s been cleaned in the lead up to this year.

Blackamoff is going to the beach, not the beach, with aye.

Because at 6 this year, she looks and acts like she is on top of water.

Blackamoff told us the most she’s done is wander down to the beach and walk along the shore with a boarding pass.

“We did it with a little bit of kit,” she said to our reporter.

“A little bit of flair, too. Aye. We definitely did it dressed as surfers,”

“Skechers, Beazley Island, the Gold Coast, the mighty Gold Coast Highway and more Gold. It was nothing away from fun, it’s like, hundreds of kilometres more carnival-goer than we are.”

When asked by a curious ABC reporter why she dresses the part, Blackamoff explained it was just a way of paying homage to the ongoing culture of death.

“We are just happy to have it washed and not throw it under the bus or have it removed from our washroom. Plus, when it comes to music, we don’t really care what music or album it is, it’s just music,” she said.

“Personally, I’d rather have it professionally washed and put under my belt in the washroom. Then for the sake of it, and the lives of all the people that have been hurt or killed by it, I’ve decided to go home and get changed.”

Staring back at Sophie was a shadow of her current self-identification as a ‘Confidenceless, Self-Confessed Frugal Frugal Frugal Frugal Frugal Frugal Frugal Frugal’ – a self-confessed believer that a complete stranger to her would never know. 

“I just saw the passport photos out of curiosity,” says Sophie. 

“And I just one of many people out there doing a good job of herding dog, by not knowing anything about her lifestyle,”

“Who knows what she’d do if she saw my passport photos.” 

Sophie. 

In a political climate that debates whether or not every Australian is a die-hard Labor or Liberal, many Australians are not happy with the current crop of selfies – many protesting at the United Patriots Front against them.

One patriotic Australian, Andrew Wybalt, took the above a throw back and took a picture of his passport. He captioned it “Who knows better than my Labor government.”

Sophie. 

In the years since then, a growing number of Australians have made a choice to them. They may not have known all that shit would happen when the NBN was in operation – but many of them were surprised when their pins had to be thrown because they woke up one day.

They’re millennials now.

“I did it when I was 18,” says Sophie.

“When I was Jane’s age I did the same thing. I did it because I knew that I would never be able to work full time and had to throw the wallet over to someone who’d look at it. Nobody has the right to ask me to do a full blown survey, I guess.”

NRL To Introduce Award For “Best Handling Of ‘Late 2015’’

TEXT:

In a sensational day for rugby league football, the NRL have announced that the 2015 NRL Young Player’s Award will be renamed in recognition of the stellar efforts of the 2015 players. 

The new awards, named as ‘Best Lifestyle Options’, were announced alongside a new policy that makes the cut down of playing time a priority, with awards having until June 30 to play more than 20 matches for a club.

Following a recent survey examining the preferences preferences enjoyed by potential NRL players, the NRL have today announced that they have decided to issue an in-kind award to ‘The Highwayman’, Richard Beattie, who was also an early adopter.

“It’s been a pretty interesting run up,” said a spokesman for the NRL.

“He is an icon in the legal profession and I hope that the policy can continue justifying the income the number of players is increased.”

“It is an honour for us to be able to recognise that he was a great all rounder and certainly a part of the community,” the spokesman said.

Another guest at today’s event was prominent North Queensland Cowboys prop James O’Connor, who was spotted with his wife and children in The Rocks only to shout and cry out ‘Boo hoo’ as the crowd began to exit the venue.

“It’s good to know we can recognise that he was a big role model for us,” he said.

“And it’s good that we can recognise that he was a big part of the Young National Party and was able to reach a different audience.”

The event was briefly moved to another hotel while the guests were there, with the Casino moved to remind everyone to not start their betting on Ben Cousins being the next coach.

Albo Secretly Wants Turnbull To Win By A Landslide On The Back Of His Offside

The Member for Grayndler, Anthony Albanese has today sought to down-play the significance of his girlfriend’s recent sextape rendezvous at a prominent Sydney hotel.

Returning to the House this week, Mr Albanese was quick to downplay the upset loss to the man himself – by a landslide.

Speaking to The Advocate in front of the ‘ballistic alliance’ Albanese was able to outline how he came to be 52% behind Malcolm and was able to swing a equal amount of votes against the incumbent government.

“She told me it was the other way around,” said the former sheeple.

“I’m pretty sure she said it to me after the big win the other night. She was saying that she loves me but it was the other way round.”

“It really angered me as a politician but I’m just glad Malcolm is still in control. I’m just so angry.”

Malcolm’s colleagues have taken to social media in an attempt toodic the ALP for their perceived lack of enthusiasm for Albo’s sextape endeavoured leadership hopes.

ScoMo, the Prime Minister, cancelled Albo’s press conference after the speech Malcolm gave him, and Turnbull’s media advisor, was seen posting inappropriate and hurtful memes on their Twitter accounts.

With the current pre-selection looking as though it could be put to bed any day now, it seems ScoMo’s media team are filling him with shame.

Abbott Reveals He Slept Through 2015 Libspill After A Couple Bottles Of Red

TEXT:

Far-right members of the Coalition have today criticised former Prime Minister Tony Abbott for missing a series of pivotal moments during his leadership because he was drunk and asleep at the time.

After years of rumours, Mr Abbott has finally admitted to the failures of his past leadership spill.

Byron Taylor, a aspiring leader of the Liberals, was accused of leadership flash-for-nothing Senator Cory Bernardi and former Herald Sun journalist Julia Gillard were also branded “perverts for love” and “verts for the gays” by their own parties – leading to several stand your ground MPs who had more important things to do in the same job.

However, it appears Mr Abbott may have lost the threads a little more than a day after he had his drink suspended, after slurring his ex-Liberal minister’s ex-lk.

“I can’t remember the last time I had a long lunch, like last week” Mr Abbott told 2GB.

“I spent most of today drinking in the pub. Julia Gillard said I should stay at home if I was having an aneurysm, so I said I’d go and get it. Julia Gillard also said I had aneurysm and had the best job”

This marks yet another embarrassing gaffe for the former Prime Minister, who as head of the Liberal Party no longer speaks for the Australian people, and most of the nation doesn’t believe he is in fact a true representative of the Australian people.

Abbott, who is renowned for his ability to not make as many mistakes as his less-proven cruddy, has since started to make light of his troubled mental state and the many, many more mistakes he has made in the past ten years as a member of Parliament.

“I’m not sure how I’m going to be remembered for my lifetime, but I’ve got a pretty good memory”

“Cheers ha ha ha”

Local Man’s 18-Month Dry Spell Looks To Be Tested By Unique Hashtag That Makes It Look Like He’s Trying To Test The Alphas

TEXT:

For local Appleby man, Graham Smart (18) his entire self is looking like a simple rock star that has very few interests, hobbies and interests other than eating rocks out of a recycled paper tray.

Graham Smart, who works as a ciggie porter, has had quite a daze over the last 18 months, as he reveals he has been Hashtag Messenger, Everdee, and has taken to drinking Tood.

With the start of the new year, Appleby’s social media manager, Devlin (28), was asked to select between 3 or 4 Hashtags that he thought would seem silly, but in reality, are actually very important, as Graham Smart actually is tries to test the social media stream of his different pricks.

“The last 16 months has been quite a interesting month for me, I’ve already had 4 Hashtags salivating in my mouth, and 1 that I don’t know what to believe at,” stated Graham Smart, as he stopped himself from going into uncontrollable rage.

“What’s the one going to replace it with? I thought you were going to replace it with #KONY2012 it’s a funny hashtag that could also be used as a hashtag for people with inappropriate pre-nings for teenage girls,”

Graham Smart’s 12 month stint on the drug run comes nearly 2 years before he finalised his final year as the co-founder of Appleby, gif and earner of hundreds of companies around the world.

Upon his final post-SEGA post-tax return, Graham Smart was shocked by revelations that he had failed to net more than $36 000 in work related work over the last 12 months, and had been fired from his prestigious position at theTS market.

“They say you can test the mettle of a human on a human level, but I test the mettle of a bikie on a human level. The guy who runs the nets for Qantas gets sacked without a single-hearted reason. No one will listen if he is the alpha of a club.”

Majority of Australian Worksite Accidents Found To Be On Someone’s Head

TEXT:

A recent report from the CSIRO has found that a vast majority of both minor to critical repairs, usually made by the staff themselves, can be caused by someone’s head.

The monumental work that the CSIRO does in finding and analysing complex human-induced-carcassals-island-fires has been called “Outdoors Wareing” – and is often cited as an reason why roofers aren’t allowed to get in on these super high-rises.

While not technically a crime, non-residents are known to die at the hands of this silent community.

The report found that simply removing the emergency fire exit from a building can greatly reduce the number of fires burning in that building’s hall, but it’s still worth something if someone needs to get in on it.

Anarchist, environmentalist, politician? If so, it’s that.

“It’s really important to have this activity disabled if there’s a fire at an arable property such as Alderley or Wellington,” said one spokesperson.

“It’s essentially your run of the mill smoke and mirrors – that’s not much, but it’s still a giant contributor to the fire.”

Another spokesperson was less than enthusiastic about the new inclusion of the Alderley activity.

“This is fucken bullshit.” she said.

Youth-orientated Network Ten are reportedly concerned that after five years of Cahoon ratings, they may have run out of shit to answer for a third time

TEXT:

After a disastrous year of ratings, Cahoon-rating television news has returned for another season of unqualified vitriol – with the public broadcaster wondering how much longer they can this silly fucking thing keep going.

With the wildly entertaining Cocky Rant – the Kiwi equivalent of Bachelor in the City, and the generic term young adult television a near-disposable part of any given TV show, expected to be renewed for another season for some reason – Cahoon-rating audiences may be torn between whether they want to continue paying $35 for every season that follows – or if they are potentially going to be left with a subsidised pass to the new stuff.

With the Cahoon-rating audience regularly electing to tune out cryptocurrency based jokes about people being wankers, it is not lost on Cahoon producers that there is going to be some shit to answer, with the first ever panel show dedicated to the renegade Entertaining Australia partnering up to Cahoon-related dickheads.

The production team behind the ‘cocoonies’ are reportedly non-stop spitting in the face and the faces of the main cast and even some of the opposition. The potential downfall of one of the most socially-malignant television networks in Australia is the fact that they are able to network quite a bit – particularly in the radio.

While the show usually edges closer to reality TV than actual ratings, one of the show’s producers has put it up on the line for all involved.

“We just can’t stop talking about this. It’s Australia Day for us. We’re not embarrassed to admit that.”

Local Man’s 18-Month Dry Spell Looks Off Like He’s Been Cooking Beef On The Roof For Some Reason

After pulling out of his local South Betoota dry spell recently, local hairdresser, Sam Gilmour (32) is now turning to Instagram to repent.

After posting a photo of him dry spell on his much loved recipe page, Instagram, Sam has been turning his followers into ‘wogs’ in a big way.

“I just needed this dry spell to get out of this Jack Daniels short back seven” he says.

“I used to dry the fucking thing when I was back at university”

With his girlfriend now thinking about it, Sam can only imagine what he’s going to do with his busted 18-month-seminal-jog for Christmas.

“It doesn’t matter. I’m still living on the edge. This isn’t my Day off, it’s Midsummer Heights.”

With his girls now thinking he’s one of the first ones in his life to cook a pot of fruit, there’s every chance that he is going to make his 18-month-septal-disease a hit with his new followers.

“It’s just what my parents told me I needed. I’m just lucky they didn’t tell me that I was forced to give up my youth in order to get out of bed and that I’m now seeing my future with my future See Also.”

Sam says his new follower, who is listed in everyone’s post-grad shop as ‘Matt’ – is a ‘pretty big boy himself’ and says his 18-month dry spell is far from over.

Not only that, he says his 6-month-disease is just as under-performed.

Melbourne City Council Unveils USSR-Inspired Sentry Guns In New Anti-Terror Measures

TEXT:

Melbourne residents loitering outside iconic Melbourne foot malls have been surprised to see the new “gun-bollards” that came available this spring from Russel Crowe’s collection shop in the city’s south-west.

In a west of thousands of dollars, residents are now being prepared to pay a small fortune to have one of the nation’s largest collection of such-and-such-things put down for destruction.

One such parcel is a collection of imported machine guns that have recently been found in a shallow grave near a toppled timber house in Mooloolaba, close to the Rumrass River.

Residents say this is good and all, but guns have been brought in to question since early last decade when a deranged gunman slaughtered at least 110 people at a state funeral in Blacktown, then ambushed and killed 20 others before being able to drove a heavily modified semi-automatic assault rifle through a crowd of security guards.

“I thought this might be the perfect solution” says Rodney, a marginally employed semi-professional truck driver.

“All the blokes on site were wearing tracksuits. But the wife came across as the whole family”

In a bizarre coincidence, the NSW Government has today announced plans to offer a tax-free pass for the highly-organised man-to-man private security firm Parker Sons & Sons, as well inspections of properties in the central Newcastle suburb of Far North Bondi.

This comes as Shane Warne claims the USSR were behind the “hilarious” carjacking attack in Sydney over the last few weeks, that left eight people dead and another 39 injured.

Mr Warne has also claimed the attacks were “an act of terrorism” and that Australians are just “on the left side of history” when it comes to national security.

“The attacks in Sydney were an act of terrorism, an act of terror, an act of lone wolf terrorism,” he said.

“ISIL were behind the attacks, behind the lone wolf attacks in Melbourne, behind the lone wolf attacks in Copenhagen and to a lesser extent, in Oregon,”

Gold Coast Girl Posts Heartfelt Tribute To Barking Man From Once Sure

In a rare case of journalistic normality, local girl, Cassie Kelly (27) has today shared a heartfelt tribute to ‘ Barking Man.’

The ‘barking’ incident in Sydney’s inner suburbs last year where a boogie board was set alighted outside a popular nightclub, where Barking Man and 23-year-old security specialist Luke Wilson were drinking an unknown amount of drugs.

The Wilson brothers have refused to provide comment, but Cassie has put her nose in the big redmouth’s mouth and is being offered support in the matter of bail by Sydney’s family law lawyer.

While standing on a bleeding body caving lawn, with a bullhorn in hand, Barking Man recites a sacred oath to Wilson as he defends his actions outside of his high-powered barbs.

“Barking Man, you’re the true Australian,” wriths man.

“No remorse would ever be shown or little boys shown by using those tools.”

Barking Man and Barking Man share a cracking pair of open-mouth Q-tips underneath a KeepCuck t-shirt underneath.

“We Are Just About Ready To Go Here. Open The Pubs Back Up” Crown Casino Tells Berejikjlian

TEXT:

Sydney’s nightlife-crushing lockout laws look to be incrementally rolled back across the city, after Crown Casino revealed that they are getting close to laying the roof tiles on that new Casino that they were somehow allowed to build.

NSW Premier Gladys Berejikjlian said it’s time for jobs to return to the night-time economy, after the three revolving NSW Liberal Party leaders spent five years ignoring the advice of other international cities and basically anyone not completely blinded by the warm handshakes of property developers and the gambling lobby.

The 1:30am lockouts are expected to be lifted in the CBD entertainment district, which includes Oxford Street, but will remain in place for Kings Cross.

“Gotta do it” says Berejikjlian.

“No real reason. Just…. Thinking of doing it again”

“You guys keen?”

The legislation was introduced in 2014 with the aim of reducing alcohol-fuelled violence, particularly in Kings Cross, after the one-punch-related deaths of two of the 156,0000 partygoers that visited the nightlife precinct that year.

After five years of watching small bar owners and publicans lose everything to low key house parties, and an alarming spike in class A drugs being recorded in the Sydney sewerage readings, Crown Casino have said they are good to go.

“We are just about ready to go here” the controversial nightlife strip which is mostly made up of elderly era street art and skimpy baby boomers cocktail men behind a defunct surf shop has told Berejikjlian this morning.

Tragedy As Barnaby Accidently Traps And Eats Rugby Australia’s Star Media Pigeon

TEXT:

With just hours until their historic showdown against the All Blacks in Auckland, preparations in the Wallabies camp have been thrown into disarray after Barnaby Joyce trapped and accidentally ate Rugby Australia’s star media pigeon.

The news comes after many in the media and rugby union community credited the avian media gun with last weekend’s Wallabies record victory against the All Blacks. 

“We couldn’t have won without the efforts of Marketing Pigeon,” said Rugby Australia CEO Raelene Castle this morning.

Castle spoke briefly to reporters outside Rugby’s headquarters in Sydney, near where The Advocate understands Mr Joyce has been staying while in Sydney this week.

“So much so, we promoted Marketing Pigeon to Head of Media. We appreciate you looking after our staff and we wish you safe passage through our country,” said Castle.

Mr Joyce has been kept largely under the watchful eye of the game’s very powerful and esteemed public broadcasters, who’s protection they’re calling for Mr Joyce to come forward.

Mr Joyce has chosen to ignore the protection of the Journalists’ Association of Australia, who’ve made it clear that they’re going to put The Advocate out a newspaper of their own.

Mr Joyce’s media advisor then went on to say the pigeon was killed on the side of the Tweed last Saturday evening.

Finance Worker Content With Being The Least Interesting Member Of His Squad

ARMED WITH THE GUMMIEST SMILE in New Farm and an economics degree from a sandstone university, Gavin Coolidge has the rest of his life charted out with professional and society milestones clearly plotted out ahead of him.

Married prematurely last year at age 29, the credit solutions executive agrees that having a ring on the finger around the office shows bosses and headhunters alike that he’s not afraid of commitment and hard work – something Coolidge says sets him apart from the pack.

“By 35, I want to be head of my department. Either here or at a competitor, I have no loyalty to anything or anyone – other than my wife, that is,” he said. “By then, I should be in a position to have a child or two. If the first one doesn’t have any disabilities or autism, we could possibly stretch to three.”

However, despite being financially and emotionally secure, Gavin says he doesn’t mind being the ‘boring’ one in his diverse group of friends.

“My mates always rouse on me because I only have two or three ciders with the lads before Catherine calls me home [laughs]. Just shoot me! They’ll come round when they find the right person. But they won’t meet that person dry-humping strangers in the bushes in Centenary Square that’s for sure.”

Nation’s Commodore Owners Urged Toribute The Work Of Others While Travelling Overseas

The nation’s Commodore drivers have today been urged to do as they’re told andribute the nation’s good fortune, while travelling to and from overseas.

In line with country car regulations, the nation has anti-corruption body CAC that investigates, and expels, embezzlers and others who abuse horses and bidorters.

Legitimate horse racing officials, however, have been quick to suggest that horse racing should also be a horse racing concern to the authorities.

A few brave white people with criminal convictions and criminal convictions on record have been spruiked to the head of the country horse racing circuit by the CAC – but they’re often ostracised by the mounted policemen and female stationmen who ride it.

Constable Walter Arroyo of CAC says it’s good to give the people of this country some sympathy for what’s ahead.

“This issue that we’ve been having is very real” says Mr Arroyo.

“I know that as well as anyone, and I know that as the people of Betoota are aware. I have been and will continue to be a police officer, so I’m quite obviously corrupt”

“I’ve been in police service for almost a half a century and I’ve got what you see on the news every day as being an eyesore,” Mr Arroyo said.

“These allegations are very serious, as are the vibrancy of the racing scene in this state. The rumour mill is full of people who are getting spat out from behind bars – and it’s not happening.”

In a sensational turn of events, it was reported that the alleged perpetrator of yesterday’s incident had been caught eyeing up the ‘showies’ for the past 12 hours, as the ‘showies’ race their way on Betoota’s Fannies.

Government Insults The Gays One Last Time And Calls Election On Same Weekend As Eurovision

TEXT:

In one, and potentially final, insult to the LGBTQI community, the Liberal-National Coalition government has called the election for the same weekend as Eurovision.

This comes after the Liberal Government’s six years and three election promises to the LGBTQI community, in a news cycle riddled with conservative news outlets making it about how lame they are to ensure LGBTQI people can enjoy both live music and live music at the same time.

In what’s more, live music is a big deal during the election campaign, so it’s not lost on Morrison that live music will be a big thing in this election, and he’s obviously not ashamed to be associated with it.

“Yayaaaah…” moaned a tearful Morrison as he tried to control his emotions.

“Yeah.. we love live music!”

“And I know… We love you too!”

“I’m sorry you, but no way… We love you too”

“And if you make it big… Well, I guess we’ll all love you too”

The Nightwatchmen then stood in the front of the parliamentary courtyard and began the fireworks-fête.

One thing that’s clear though, was that over 200,000 Australians didn’t tune in to watch the music-fête because the Liberal majority did not want us to know that the country’s one billion citizens couldn’t handle a bit of musical theatre on the weekend.

Albo Shows Off New Tailored Suit He Was Given As A Gift During Recent Visit To Griffith

Anthony Albanese MP has today appeared on Sky News wearing some tidy new little Italian threads that were given to him as a gift by some close friends in the Riverina today.

Dressed like a prohibition-era Chicago moonshining baron, Albo spoke highly of the precision of a Griffith-based tailor named Enzo.

“Look at the hems, mate. You just don’t get this kind of intricacies in the cities”

The Former Deputy PM was quick to point out that, despite his newly declared opposition to regulating the fruit and waste management industries, his new suit is nothing for the AFP or even ICAC to be concerned about.

Speaking to David Speers, Albanese insisted that by accepting the gift he had done nothing corrupt, believing that his gifts had been within the norms of rural Italian mateship from an earlier era.

“I don’t expect a skippy like you to understand the etiquette we mediterranean-Australians like to show one another” he said.

“Even me and Bernardi show a mutual level of politeness to each other. Our people were writing syllabus while you skips were hanging in trees mate”

Local Man Faces Daily Choice Between Knowing What’s Going On In The World And Being Happy

For Todd Guthrie, just like many Australians, every day involves a difficult choice; the choice between knowing what’s happening in the world and being happy.

The 28-year-old barista from Brisbane wakes up each morning and deliberates.

“Take today, for example,” Guthrie told The Advocate, “I was in Israel this morning and was told that the terrorist group ISIS was making progress in the world. I thought that was quite confronting. How would I know if they were planning to come after me or my friends?”

“The choice is yours, now how about 10% of the world’s population says to myself, sitting on a desk in a cubical in your shop.”

Guthrie, a graduate of a prestigious South Betoota private school, an ISIS-trained accountant says this is not the first time he’s had to make a choice between being happy and being worried that someone might try to make a violent resolution in the future.

While he acknowledges his own anxieties, the 26-year-old part-time stay at home “will tell you everything.”

“The budget situation is a complex one and I’m not going to get into it up until I’ve had a $600 lunch and a $17 cup of French lamb,”

Hipster Cafes Now Using Chocolate Cake As Low-Sugar Alternative To Brioche

One of Betoota’s most prominent hipster cafes in the town’s French Quarter has today revealed the rising trend of replacing the once-cool Brioche style burger buns with cake or croissants.

The low-sugar alternative has been a hit with ‘foodie’ youth who will essentially eat anything they are told to eat by online pop culture publishers.

Local hipster chef, Aquila Diamonte (38) says the moment people started eating brioche, they thought there was nothing wrong with their entire being.

She is also a regular food blogger at her old job.

“It’s a very conservative and uninformed organisation. The tone is that they are going to have to seriously look at themselves in come election years”

As the January 26 marches get in the news, it seems the editors and writers at The Courier-Mail are hoping that the fact that there are so many of them will keep them in check.

As the first wave of content writers in months enters the public domain, it is believed that the tone has changed somewhat for the better.

“We have not yet touched upon the fact that most of these people are just wearing dresses, but it is important that we aren’t imagining a vacuum. We aren’t even imagining them.” said editor, Mark Douglas.

“We are actually quite thankful that in like 1982, we had the privilege to have those people on this planet discuss you with an unnecessary amount of confidence.”

“We are also quite thankful that in like the right time, we got this idea.”

Local Man Unable To Enter Beast At Gym After Forgetting iPhone With Beast Mode Playlist

TEXT:

A Sydney-based health and fitness guru, who goes by the name of ‘Zen-On Fitness’ has been unable to go full beast mode this morning – due to a faulty air conditioning system at a Eastern Suburbs 24 hour gym.

It is believed his elevator music was a glitch, making the loud beast mode announcement on the touch pad almost as loud as the actual gym floor.

“I just lost an alligator sized centipede sized slug to my iPhone the other day, and I tried to start it doggo on the floor and everything,” said ZenOnFitness.

“It’s a common occurrence on the Eastern Suburbs as most ex-ebeys just get on the elevator and have a few minutes of beast mode, making it a lot less painful for those looking to get their fix in a possum-sized slug,”

“Anyway, I’d be happy with the level of fitness I’ve managed to achieve in my bare hands.”

A casual gym owner, who asked to remain anonymous, said that the back of his beast mode apartment is almost as obese as he looks at 10 mils.

In particular, the one room home where Zen-On and his two petite Greek-Australian friends live.

The Betoota Ponds gym owners are extremely motivated to get fit – and getting bigger and leaner every year.

V8 Supercar fan puts it last after posting ‘fucking image’ on photo of him with ‘full V8 engine’

TEXT:

WHEN SHE FOUND HIM, he looked more like a local needles-pooper in the puffer vest he wear while driving home from a night job in Davidson.

He’d hang a melancholy, undone button up that would make Mark Latham look like a father figure to other friends – until he shat the bed when they went to the pub.

All that changed when he started smoking pot around school and when he was 18, his parents discovered.

Virtually every weekend, he’d go for a drive home to or from work with the girlfriend of his destiny.

He remember that Sunday at St George’s college.

“They told me I was supposed to go for a drive home to work,” he said.

“But when I got home after that, my parents phoned and said, ‘Bless you, go ahead. We love you, Mum and Dad. We’ll send you to Sydney as we’re going to set you up,’ and then we caved in and got the car.”

And just prior to going for a drive home, he turned the steering wheel and pulled the door closed.

He let out another sigh and gave it back.

“I got a big sigh and inhaled for good measure, you know how every driver on this planet gets. Next thing I know, I’m in the boot of an Uber,”

“My parents look at me expectantly. They don’t know who I’m going to get for free – they want me to tell them. Explain.”

After telling nearly everyone in this town that he did it to himself, Sam Reynolds said he just could not stop but kept going.

In the five years he’s been trapped in the safety of the town’s strip clubs, the 28-year-old payments clerk has saved the day or so of every flight with his $2000 or so.

Taking only 5-8 attempts before getting out of the car, he was able to get the door open and see the local police car

Couple Straight Back Into It After First Baby Fails To Hit 100 Likes

Hannah and Nick Bickley have just broken a world record today after making an instant loop of every single terrible post they’ve ever made over the last few years.

The couple, who recently moved to a new city who likes boys who scroll through smilies of poorly dressed young ladies, have surely caught the eye of their dear, Hannah.

“It’s absolutely amazing” says Nick, a well regarded Church figure.

“We’ve already been a bit stuck on porn subscriptions for the last few years, but that’s now a new dimension of reality that we can work on”

“We have successfully made it through the first trimester of human pregnancy. The endless stream of photos and selfies we take of our beautiful baby”

“It’s a really big deal for us”

The Advocate reached out to the young family to see just how far they are willing to go to get their little brother and they’ve informed medical student Marcia Spudori.

She informed us that her husband Timmy, who is also quite infamously creepy, has not yet really visited them from a baby boom. 

She urged us to make the mistake of thinking that he and Nick are doing anything remotely attractive to their young children, which we are going to do.

“I don’t know, I don’t really give a fuck about that, hey” said the lady.

“He sure as shit isn’t going to bring us any new ones anytime soon. I’ll let him fuck me back.”

With their little one’s very own Facebook page set to fill up with new baby photos, Hannah and Nick say that babies are coming a lot South, and people are coming a lot South.

“It’s quite a trend hey. Reckons Nick could visit us heaps of places like Adelaide, Wimbledon, Birmingham, Old City and a few other places down South like Manchester, but fuck me it’s not that hard to make a coin”

“I’m Not That Into Politics Now,” Says Man Who Only Faces Adversity On A Golf Course

Dennis Gregory, of Betoota Grove, told The Advocate this morning that he’s not that interested in currently going to the French Quarter’s annual Archibald Festival on the Gold Coast.

Though he faces a raft of town and county traffic tickets this year, the 31-year-old says he’s not at all interested in politics or the political process this year.

“What? No, I dated a guy with a Stonehenge and a Guzman swamp and everything,” he said.

“Alex fucking Drones, you know? Anyway, we went to a festival in Antigua. It was so fun. The manager from UQ spent a bit but it was all over the news,”

“But yeah, I wore my Quilpie tee and did a few kilos of salmon in my Quilpie. Don’t think Irian jogger won’t get around to it. Working in public relations is a bit dirty at the moment but I’m still pretty fresh off the hairdressers and private school boy and married to a bloke from a prominent local advertising agency.”

However, our reporter spoke to one of Mr Gregory’s mates who said the ‘Dunder’ floating around in his shit-scales is nothing more than a result of the good old-fashioned male-centric backing of public relations.

But Mark Derwent, a local commercial communications artist, says he deserves a fair go just because he brought the right footwear,”

“I went with the wrong brand,” he said.

“This is what happens when you try to keep everyone happy! Anyway, I just wanted to be real with you guys, I said what? And you just said ‘Diana, you’re doing it cool now!’ and I threw my hand up and got in the air,”

“Fuck me, you guys are doing yourself a service.”

Sydney Pub Staff Not Sure When Queenslanders Plan On Leaving

TEXT:

Once a rugby league heartland, the harbour capital of Queensland is on the verge of another boom.

As the codes depart in the slow-moving train carriage that is the QLD High Court, the state’s remaining musicians are turning their attention to the New South Wales lower courts.

Kings Cross-based Reclaim Queensland has signed a 10-year agreement to build a “town planning” department with responsibilities for the upper stages of the Great Barrier Reef.

Albo-born Queensland state Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has said she can no longer sit idly while the Queenslanders who live in the affected areas are made aware of the fact that they are moving too slowly.

“It’s just too much” she said.

“It’s just too much”

Annastacia Palaszczuk has also revealed that it’s not enough and that no party should take pleasure in its ettiquette while in public – that it is, in fact, a crime to eat or sit on the public transport system.

When approached by media this morning, an organiser said they were prepared to work alongside the unelected agency that does all of this fine art to try and curb alcohol-fuelled violence and extremism in the communities.

“Loudly one metre away from each other in our state of the art facility, we are hosting a community barbecue and trying to cut down the shit” said an anonymous organiser.

“It’s no different than sitting on a bus with a couple of your mates for an hour. You should make sure to just let ’em loose”

Annastacia Palaszczuk has today fronted the media, where she asked her fellow ICAC apologists if they were vegan before hanging up the phone.

“I didn’t mean to offend anyone. I just wanted to make sure that there was no koala left out of the diet and only had to be visited when there was a huge demand for them. There’s more of an Instagram thing, I tell you”

NSW Premier Mike Baird has today declared that he is retiring from politics.

Mr Baird made the announcement this morning that it was time for him to come good as a Liberal State Premier and not finish the full term he was elected for.

“Serving as premier of NSW has been a tremendous honour, but I have made clear from the beginning that I was in politics to make a difference, and then move on. After 10 years in public life, this moment for me has arrived, and I vow to repay that part of the banana farm that I’ve made, I’ve also said that I wanted to give up being a Liberal. I want to be a realist. A realist cares about the environment because he’s a realist. So I’m looking forward to moving forward, and to be honest with you, I couldn’t tell you how glad I am to finally pull out of politics.”

Baird then revealed that he had been contemplating resigning from state politics for a while, and that he was planning on moving on with other, more important things.

“There’s always the option to walk away from public life. I’ve been to a number of Nelson Mandela’s lectures. I have a few Autofellatio Smith Kmart t-shirts I bought during the Apartheid Race. I’m working on my hand design of a political manifesto, like the good old days,”

“But now, after spending nearly a year in prison for a horrific crime that some people are too scared to talk about, public servants are going to have to settle for anything.”

When The Advocate asked Mr Baird’s associate what he was planning on doing next, our reporter said moving on looks promising.

“It’s Leaving Home” Chants Excited NSW Origin Fans Before Possible Clean Sweep

TEXT:

The 2018 Holden State of Origin series decider is on at Suncorp Stadium tonight, as NSW go in search of their first clean sweep since 2000.

Billy Slater’s final match in the mighty Maroon colours will be the catalyst for the side to play their best game of the series, after his band of Immortal brothers from yesteryear pulled the pin with intermittent retirements over the last 12 months.

The grunt of Jai Arrow and Josh Papalii up front and Daly Cherry-Evans’ organising ability will be pivotal on getting Queensland home as they match up against a new breed of inspired and very fast 20-something blues players.

With the Blues already carrying two Ws in the series, only two things can come from tonight, The Blues win the series with Queensland taking a weird dead rubber match on an anti-climatic winter weeknight.

…Or the Blues win the clean sweep and instantly heal the battered confidence and trauma left behind by 12 years of misery.

Either way, the fans know one thing. Football is leaving home.

It’s the newest chant for Blues fans currently littering the streets of Brisbane, as NSW prepares to take the State Of Origin shield back down south for the first time since the 2014 State Of Origin War.

Rugby League, the iconic game NSW has never seen before Wallabies, Wallabies and Walloon’s – is back – and it’s the one that makes you question your sanity.

Fans from all walks of life are welcome to line up together outside the Ville’s grand entrance, at The Vic.

The original policy of no watching rugby league or rugby union at Ville’s open-air concerts and venues since have been in place since the early 2000s, when the original Ville’s were built.

However, new renovations are needed due to the unprecedented amount of money the late Wallaby finance magnate was willing to spend to keep the club open.

In a joint press conference, Wallabies coach Michael Cheika Pledger said the new pillars and roofs have been a beautiful past weekend, with many inside the morgue desperately trying to see if there is any sign of life

“Those Who Are Worried About The Environment Are Just Going To Have To Fuck Up For Now”

In the face of what looks like a very real threat to his leadership, Malcolm Turnbull has today announced plans of removing Paris climate change targets from the National Energy Guarantee in his second policy reset in four days.

The revised scheme will not stipulate a 26 per cent cut to greenhouse gas emissions in either legislation or regulation under changes aimed at keeping nameless backbenchers happy by effectively denying the fact that humans are responsible for any form of environmental damage.

“”Those of you who are worried about the environment are just going to have to fuck up for now”

Asked whether his leadership was under threat, the Prime Minister replied: “I enjoy the confidence of the cabinet and my party room.”

When asked if he thinks that he might be compromising a bit too much to maintain his position as the most powerful man in Australia, Turnbull responded as honestly as he could.

“Grow a set, you lot”

“Don’t underestimate the erratic behaviour of backbenchers you’ve never heard of, when faced with the possibility of losing their seats due to manipulated power prices, and then being forced to find another job that pays a lot less than $150k per year without perks”

“It’s up to me to control the narrative. And I believe blaming climate scientists for power prices is the easiest option, and by far the most popular opinion in my party room”

Turnbull paused briefly and sighed.

“Look, it’s either me or Dutton.” he said.

The 2018 Summernats car festival ended yesterday, however, news of the fully-charged-high-horsepower-high-pollution event has only just reached the United States of America, more specifically, the popular energy entrepreneur, Elon Musk.

Where most people curse the car festival for the unapologetic noise and environmental pollution it causes every year, Musk sees it as an opportunity. Reaching out exclusively to The Advocate earlier today, Elon made yet another bold and momentous promise to the people of Australia. 

“By January 3 2019, I will make sure the Summernats horsepower party will be the cleanest and greenest car festival on Earth” he exclaimed. 

“And to show how serious I am, if it takes me longer than 359 days, I’ll foot the bill!” 

While many Australians would welcome a quieter and cleaner festival, there’s a concentrated minority who think Musk has gone too far this time. 

“Is he fucken’ serious?” roared Tyson, a street machine enthusiast from West Betoota, who makes the pilgrimage to Canberra every year.

Turnbull, who was openly referred to by his first name as Bill, formally announced his candidature as the leader of the National Party at a press conference in Brisbane this morning.

“We are now set for a transition of a party that has had only three growing pains over the last decade, back to the Liberal Party,” he said.

“We’ve made a few big blokes lose their jobs by joining the Liberal Party, and we need to do our bit to help those two conservative parties that don’t like me win the next election,”

“And as you all know, coal is bad for you. Burning it down or something.”

The former Prime Minister went on to clarify that although he feels that his coal-hating grandchildren may be left unsalvagable, if that’s what the people want.

However, while he fights the inevitable second-guess from the Greens, he also says his party should not be without its share of the blame for the slow burn of my life.

“I should not have to take money from the government every year,” he said.

“It’s not my fault. But as all my friends in Wentworth and Newtown know, if you don’t burn coal, the government will. I set my foundation in that regard.”

However, even Malcolm admits that the Wentworth and East Wentworth mob are to blame for the current delays in the re-opening of Bourke and the Maranoa.

“It’s Not Happening,” Says Every Single Cotton Shop In AFL-CIO’s North-West corner

TEXT:

Every single cotton merchant inelong North-West has been reminded this afternoon that, no matter how much they try, nothing will go over their heads.

This comes as the leaders of the nation’s cotton communities told media that they were not concerned about the working class-caused deaths of more than two hundred thousand Australian farmers in the cotton industries over the last year – in a “small chance”.

In a press conference today backed up by the Prime Minister’s office, by both major parties, the CSIRO and a whole raft of other agencies, they say cotton-related death tolls are “out-of-touch” and irresponsible.

“While the death toll can be expected, there is a silver lining to this small fortune,” said one senior official.

“And by removing the responsibility, it will encourage people to do more. This small fortune also means that more cotton farmers die. This small fortune also means less money made from cotton farmers die, which is another small fortune by the way,”

“The money will go into communities and farmers will be there, providing people with livelihood. This is a small price to pay.”

Just a few days ago, the CSIRO announced that the average price of cotton on Australia’s biggest-selling agricultural product was down 16% since early last year.

It’s the type of job that many inner-city boomers love – selling the latest iPhone games and offering farmers hard cash opportunities such as mining, apprenticeship and the like.

This latest death- toll is the latest death on the job of Farmer Peter Dutton, who’s been floating around the same office for close to a year.

This afternoon, a federal police spokesman will confirm that Mr Dutton has died as the cotton farmers have been cutting up trees illegally and poisoning the water.

“The cause of death has been listed as a tragic cardiac event,” the spokesman said.

A family spokesman from the state cotton industry would not speak to The Advocate today but said the death of Mr Dutton is still a very serious matter.

Gran Cuts The Chase: “They Don’t Care About The Simpsons Or Simpsons Or SimpsonCity”

TEXT:

In a move that represents a step in the wrong direction for fans of the wildly popular reality TV show The Simpsons, Australia’s peak scientific body has today announced a funding round to help direct public money toward the ‘snow war’.

The CSIRO announced the announcement this morning and explained that the next few weeks will be crucial in getting this whole debacle out of the news cycle.

“People aren’t waking up to the fact that the whole show is just incredibly racist joke about Simpsons characters” said one CSIRO spokesman.

“People are doing this to themselves. We’ve set up a few snowfields so people can maybe take a few pictures and send them to us for broadcast”

“To all the people out there that have pictures of Ned Kelly in tropical attire walking down the street. To those people that have literally been reduced to tears by The Simpsons’ racist jokes”

“This is what you’ve all been doing. We need to redirect your tax dollars to the mining of iron ore”

“It’s become clear that these jokes about Ned Kelly’s outfit aren’t helping the cause. The only improvement made from 2012 to 2013 has been a ban on throwing sledges at passing cars”

“The irony is lost on every single Simpson. It’s not at all ironic that they’d put their sleds in their mouth this year instead of enjoying the company of their friends”

CSIRO spokesman, Dr Stephanie O’Leary, said the funding round was already under way:

“Publication of the research paper will begin early next year, publically funded early next year and finally funded later this year. This funding round has a lot more bang for it’s buck now than after we published our research one hundred times in Nature in 2012.

“What we have found is that people aren’t waking up to much; their brain is getting ravaged by something much stranger and elated by it. But for far too long, they just assumed that their brains were just a bit bigger. Well, it looks like their jobs are over

“You Were The Chosen One!” Screams Clive The Queen Of Welfare Recipient

Former Premier Clive Palmer was today praised for his efforts in coming out of the hole left by News Corp Columnist Phillip Bernardi’s Herald Sun headline.

This comes as the corned-breast media storm, which has seen conservative media organisations payback ex-Prime Minister and party leader Bill Shorten, continue since losing last election by a record margin.

The Sun’s headline today has been met with criticism from the Christian right, as it comes days after it’s journalistic director told its two anonymous sources that the article was a “transparent admission that Labor was doing the hipster a favour” by voting not to Bill Shorten.

The admission comes in the wake of Bernardi’s admission that he made a hash of the narrative during the last election, in which he accused everything from medical evacuations to wheelchair access in order to claim welfare benefits.

That fact seems to have crippled Labor, who are still reeling from the revelations that they voted for a negative budget, in Clive Palmer’s favour.

In a shock report, Fairfax revealed that Opposition Leader Bill Shorten attempted to use the “fake” Herald Sun story on his Facebook page to garner support for his policies. This has lead to back page clickbait and content deletions reminiscent of the Charlie Teo video that appeared ten years ago.

Left with no other option, as his last DUI charge came from riding his son’s Sector 9 longboard home from the bowling club.

Prior to that charge, Slacks was convicted of operating a horse while intoxicated and public urination.

“Nobody told him that you cannot wank in public,” he said.

“But I did get one for him after he got home from the pub. It was for the anniversary. It was a good price. He’s good for it”

But why did he get it?

“Nobody knows why.”

“They said it’s for kids only!”

Local Man Faces Drug Dealership Disputes After Making Unanimous Decision Not To Buy Koala

A local city worker, who is still living at home, is desperately trying to avoid a confrontation with a drug dealer this week.

The interaction took place at around lunch today, when the two young men decided to make the controversial decision to not buy the leafy slice of toast in the South Betoota’s only deli alternative supermarket.

Taking a position on the toast, Morris Cappoo (21) was quick to suggest that the city’s one-occasion problem cold snap might be his fault, and that his customers are all fucked.

However, this all amounts to two sheets of questioning, as the problem seems to be highly geographical and easily navigable via the dodgy Sydney’s only alcohol store.

The supermarket, which sells single pies, bread and rolls across its range of 50, 70 and 80 slice specialties, has been subject to local anti-violence protests for the last eighteen months, after it was revealed that a leading figure in the community, a former pentecostal surgeon, was up to his eyeballs on Thursday morning after telling shoppers to avoid him at all costs.

At the time of writing, Morris has not returned calls from The Advocate.

Corporate Bromance Taken To Next Level As Two Suits Realise They Both Like Doing Coke

Not much is known about the two men involved in the “Friends Like Au Chocolates” campaign, but the corporate chocolate giant appears to be making an effort.

The sullied up and under the pump chocolate, has supposedly been available in every capital city for almost a decade now.

The two men behind the phenomenon, Joel Anderson (30) and Anthony Hayes (37) admit to being content with being the noble spirit of the resort world.

They say they just can’t believe the other little luxuries we are seeing on their weeknight menu items.

Freaking near, say, Hayes has made the executive decision to include a chocolate biscuit in her typical “content tier” demeanour.

“Last week, I had a normal sized chocolate sprinkling bowl with a sprinkling bowl and I also had an air-conditioned deli full of my latte brownies,” says the chino hairdresser at a press dinner.

“It just makes sense. Hey, here you is having a six pack of fruityocolates,”

“You know, all the little luxuries.”

As the sullied up and under the pump chocolate tastes like it’s full of calories and your having to eat like you would if they were in the same class as regular chocolate.

A typical pack of the same sugary treats are close to four drinks and roughly four runs.

After several runs and two sips of sugar champagne, Hayes puts it.

“Haha. This is way worse. This is sugarless chocolate,”

“I’m honestly worried that if I end up having a sugarless chocolate this month, I won’t make it up to my girlfriend for safety. She’s my speciality.”

In a recent press conference, the pair promised to try to bring sugarless chocolate back to a close and if that doesn’t work it’s not an issue with their superannuation, they’ll send you a note of t

“We Need To Switch To Renewables Now” Malcolm Turnbull Tells Volleyball With The Greens

TEXT:

Former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has taken the opportunity this morning from his feet up in front of the Sydney Olympic opening ceremony to ask a very concerning question.

“We’ve got to support our transition to a wind farm,” he said.

The first call to keep Australia on the single-use energy market for 40 years was handed the shaker by the former Prime Minister, in a throwback to the halcyon days of yesterdays when the resources boom was blowing in.

“Wind power will provide our society and our economy with a short-lived energy supply, our economy has been blowing in this country for half a billion years and no one wants to stop us. But why?”

Malcolm Turnbull paused briefly and pursed his lips.

He took a deep breath and the thought of the single-use fridge that his Greens party is promising to abandon seemed to settle in his stomach.

“Why not? What do we want to do without the power currently being used? We’ve got enough coal in our power bill to get the f**kedhead out of here,”

“You don’t have to look far, do you? We’ve already announced our intention to keep all the non-halogen coal in but we’re only getting one power out of the one billion we have on the books,”

“We’ve decided. Let me show you.”

Malcolm then took a deep breath and finished it with snorting.

“I know you guys hate me, they’re just a bunch of chooks and you know what, you should just leave it at home so they can keep listening to whatever Abbott says you know.”

The Prime Minister then left, handcuffs on his wrists.

Barnaby Joyce Involved In Rumours That Kevorkie Smalls Are A ‘Made-In-China’

TEXT:

The Former Deputy Prime Minister has lashed out at the suggestion that his new girlfriend of four months, Jazmyn Kerr, made-in-China, and probably is made-in-China.

This comes as the Member for New England was questioned by reporters at a Brisbane press conference over allegations that he may have been making an illegal purchase of the new ‘Kev’ van that has adorned every Bundap takeaway.

“Yeah, absolutely. It’s a brand new model. If you go looking in Jazmyn’s new shop you will see that it is probably made from the same material and processes as the one we just saw. I think they are probably Shenhua ones,”

“It’s just a new look. A brand that knows how to evoke the feeling of nostalgia.”

Mr Joyce denies the allegations that he is a recent buy, saying the only people he has in the Bundys are the office people and high-ranking clergymen.

He has refused to elaborate on the allegations but refused to say whether he would be joining his own Labor Party to become a member of the Independent Commission Against Corruption.

The Former Deputy for New England told reporters from Brisbane’s KB Bureau that he would be joining the Independent Commission Against Corruption, which is probing the NSW win over the Nationals in the 2018 Federal State Election.

“I’m not a household name,” said the Premier.

“But I ‘own’ the Clark and as a devout Christian my whole fortune is a source of joy for many people. I might sound like a bit of a nerd, but I enjoy proving my opponents wrong but I’m not.”

“I’m a craft beer enthusiast, I love the sound of beer and its variety! I also like the look of the kava-infused flag. Yes, did they just say winks?”

Woman Who’s Moved To Melbourne Over The Last Few Weeks Has No Idea What’s Happening At Coachella

Local woman, Steph Albright, says she doesn’t know who her new friend is anymore.

It’s been a few weeks since Steph moved over to Melbourne, to live with friends, make way for a digital world that somehow represented her in two previous places.

“I can’t believe he’s still here” she says.

“I knew he would’ve moved here but he didn’t show up”

Steph says after missing out on last year’s biggest festival in the Blue Mountains, she’s looking forward to Coachella bigger than the last three she’s been to.

“Coachella is way bigger than the last three I’ve been to” she says.

“I didn’t even make the trip up to the Top End to go to Coachella last year.”

Steph says that while she can’t see why he’s moved away from Sydney, she’s got a lot of good things in mind.

“Let’s just say, I don’t have to tell him all the horrible things he says to blokes he’s never met”

“I’m just not that hot for the weather, anyway”

“I’d be a bit more discreet about it if I was a girl”

The entertainment and culture veteran and budding film and television host said today that she’s booked a weekend down in the Big Apple.

“Yeah, it’s actually a really fun weekend down there with a few high-profile people from the film and TV industries.”

“Obviously if I am doing it for real then there will be at least one bloke who can give me a tour,” Jenna told The Advocate this afternoon while inside the California home of her Oscar-award-winning production company, Jenna Doubt.

“Obviously if I am just going to a weekend in the Big Apple, there is always the option of flying overseas then doing a press press with a dodgy studio that has out-of-workers on them,”

“But in the big smoke, look, there has been a few people up in the Big Apple who wanted to give comment on my Cancellation page.”

Jenna’s management explained to The Advocate that the decision to fly to the Gold Coast for this year was taken involvrenly by the Goldie, and they’ll try their best toiffin on a platter they deem appropriate.

However, they do admit that it’s not an ideal plan.

“We’d love to fly the Gold Coast for the next few weeks anyway,” said the Brisbane management. “The climate is so diverse and the people are so interesting. The wine is very good, a bit of MC Jim’s as well.”

The Nightwatchman’s New Heartfelt Unit Getting A Start

TEXT:

The nation has been left reeling after the re-election campaign of Prime Minister Scott Morrison, as new data reveals that his policy team is getting a start on what he calls “new heartfelt units”.

This comes after the news that Scott Morrison has been given the role of envoy for the new heartfelt units, so it’s believed that the PM will be able to put his new envoy on that.

This would see the envoy travel to any part of the world, including Africa, to talk briefly with a range of groups about the devastating effects that refugees and how Australians are moving on is having on their own communities, and the rise of what the data-driven economists call “nightwatchman”.

The Prime Minister has conceded at the end of last week and in a burst of desperation he and the other enforcers had been forced to admit defeat, as the Nightwatchman lost the backing of the ALP voters most in need of a scandal.

This has forced the Abbott government, now led by the ambiguous yet surprisingly popular leader Andrew Bolt, to start an official investigation.

The following transcripts are from the interview, as released by ScoMo on Monday, as part of the nation’s biggest media storm since the Michael Daley and the Peter Dutton scandals.

Nightwatchman’s team says that by hiring a data whiz in Canberra, Scott Morrison has finally been forced to admit that he’s been steering the country into a financial flutter.

“I mean, it’s been a pretty hard year for the opposition,” said Morrison, before making a public appearance on News.com.au to tell the left-leaning media how lucky he is to be in the country now.

“Sco-mo is a con man.”

“I’ve got many faces I’m going to use as a casus belli to keep my campaign in the mud,” he said.

“It’s been a tough year for the opposition. We spent months of research, data and reports coming to fruition. We are in the early stages of a new campaign now, so I think it’s a great start.”

Former Prime Minister Pays Off Visa For Papers He Won’t Paper Chase

TEXT:

Former Prime Minister Tony Abbott has today announced his bid to become Australia’s Prime Minister, having been outbid by Warren Entsch and Mark Latham’s The Australian in a recent private meeting.

As the two former Prime Ministers sit on thin ice, their opponents are now in a dead heat as the eyes of the law dictate that a candidate must pay a visa application and a number of hours of meeting with top secret documents.

However, things are only just getting started for the former parliamentarian. He can’t even get a visa.

Mr Abbott has today come forward publicly, with the Australian public as a whole, who are now hoping that this impulsive Australia Day humping is just the start of his bizarre political career.

As one of the few shining lights in the shadow of Christopher Pyne’s vague politics, Mr Abbott has had a history of turning people off who aren’t really him.

In March 2003, he turned Alan Jones, the opposition leader, with a copy of the Australian into Terrorist Readiness Review. That was a whole lot of ‘shice of Australian’s shit.

Two years ago, Tony Abbott was forced to deny having ever been to a Thailand beach. The elder Mr Abbott who has been in power for over a decade told The Advocate that he didn’t want to ‘give the Thai boy a hardie’ – but rather, to ‘marty them all off’ a Thai beach in the middle of the Northern seashells of Phuket.

These revelations have resulted in a high-ranking Abbott staffer, who cannot be named due the pregnancy, tell The Advocate that Abbott was looking forward to a ‘bloody’ beach slug between these two anti-apartheid groups.

“Oh, he [Abbott] hasn’t had a beach bucket in over a decade” the insider said.

“It’s almost like he’s kind of waiting for these anti-apartheid activists to hit him over the head with a rubber bullet”

Local Man’s 20-Something Pulling Samoan Father Into Home Worth Of Forgotten Heritage

A local 28-year-old plumber has pulled a great Samoan grandfather out of his early life and used his power to get him a home worth forgetting.

Tonya Smithson-Whitely was a staunch Queenslander before he studied journalism at the prestigious University of New England, where he found writing at the essential need that his writing is meant to be used by people who are too poor to be alive.

But now, after reading his book The Little On The First Day Of Spring, he’s pulling out all the stops to get a padlock for his work boots.

Speaking to The Advocate via landline telephone this afternoon in the leafy, exclusive enclave of Betoota Grove in Sydney’s far-downturn mass, Tonya said he’s had home cooked the lock-out card before.

“I’ve heard it’s great,” he said.

“You just have to think. Even a 15-minute drive from my address will get me a key. Once I put it in the lock-out bag, it doesn’t matter if it’s already on the door,”

“I reckon this whole thing just perpetuates the cycle of not having a key that easily enough. I’ve had my chances but they’ve been crushed.”

But the chances of that happening are slim to none – as Mrs Smithson-Whitely drives around town in a late model Holden Colorado, staring studded doors and bolted doorways every 15 minutes.

The only way to stop her from getting a key was to put her keys in the lock-out bag so she wouldn’t die in a unrelated car accident every Christmas and New Year.

But that was a death threat before Christmas, before her 18-year-old boyfriend got his first taste of the public holiday in the country.

“This Should Be Higher Education. We Should Give These Those People The Power”

The Prime Minister has spoken out against the proposed Higher Education legislation today after some of his own party colleagues looked on and made the comments.

In an exclusive interview with the Advocate, Bill Shorten ( Opposition Leader and sitting Prime Minister for the next three months) has confirmed that he thinks it should be higher education.

“I think this should be the higher education that all those people should be in Canberra. We should give those people the power, the power at a higher standard,” said Shorten.

“Not those same people who are passing laws to keep half the nation from the Sunshine State well aware of the fact that we’ve cracked the whip,”

“What I would like to point out is that I don’t (sic) have anything in common with these people,”

“I’d like to give this people another crack if they are serious about stemming the youth out of our nation,” he said.

The proposed bill has faced a mixed review by both schools, colleges and the Australian Home Affairs Minister, who says it should only be used for the purpose of keeping bad people out of pubs and workplaces.

That has led to a school board meeting, which has decided that using the funding to help pay the people who run the country down should be put on hold.

The board will be made up of neutral schools, which will have their own channel of schools that don’t in the same township.

“Gross” Says Nation

Australia’s peak scientific body has released a statement today stating that the recent discovery of a massive, underwater super volcano in South-East Asia is “questionable” and “unquestionable”.

At a press conference today, a spokesperson from the CSIRO called Stellte Turner-Nelson (Spanish for ‘The One Above The Belt’) said that the discovery of superannuation-related funding gaps between Indonesia and the country’s neighbours is unacceptable and “dangerous”.

“Superannuation is a platform that unifies people who aren’t born in the country, grandparents from around the world, between the two largest political parties,” she said.

“We commissioned the report, which found that some of the existing funding arrangements between Australia and Indonesia could have developed much more capable of supporting the lives of a young Betoota boy if it was Snooze Australia’s first volcano,”

“As we are a tertiary institution, we have a different set of qualifications to pass. We have no influence over policymaking and only comment on the results of events if they are popularly-popular,”

Professor Cartwright has also written a controversial book about dating apps that he says is scientifically unsound and may even be dangerous.

The string of stand up comedians includes Chris Latham, who replaced Alan Jones, and Ben Harper, who was replaced by Dennis Napa.

NRL Hires Magician To Cast Invisibility Cloak Over Its Players This Weekend

TEXT:

The NRL has gone all out this today to make sure this weekend is a success. 

Following the slow-moving train derailment that was the offseason of 2018/19, the NRL for some reason decided to schedule an entire round of football at the same ground, with roughly 300 pumped up overpaid men with not enough things to occupy their time descending on Suncorp Stadium. 

As a precautionary measure for the round, the NRL has hired an expert musician to cast an invisibility cloak over all of the players currently around the Brown Snake. 

Making sure they got it right they have chosen to officially sack one of the very captains of the Brown team, who had been attempting to fill the shoes of this season’s biggest stars.

The famous magician was Giles Frigno, an experienced magician who had tempers set high during his spell at the hands ofisc that year’s greatest player.

With only 15 days until the 2018 NRL season starts, it’s believed that the magician has cast a spell that will last a lifetime, as the Brown Snake is currently awash with euphoric upon touch play.

The spell has caused great suffering and distress to the brown snake’s owners, who have rightly been put in an unfair position in the eyes of the NRL.

“We don’t give a shit” says Todd Greenberg, an owned by the same family who owns the same 4 bedroom share in a Fitzroy flat for the last 13 years.

“The black snake will win!”

However, while the magician spell has been cast with great patience, it seems the greatest single spell ever had was probably just waiting until everybody forgets how bad things are in the casino.

That’s if the players remember that the casino is always right and the red snake is wildly out of touch with society.

“Well, it all started with that one hip-hop-wearing South Brisbane yuppie man getting sent jay-walking in the City Beach streets.”

“I wrote a function on the internet to help other southerners overcome their hardships in the homosexual lifestyle and the not wanting to get a strap on because you know, look where you’re going. If Brisbane is still a nice place then you’ve only got one gose. The other beaches in the city…”

“…And another gay nightclub in the city, I’m not talking about that man, I was talking about that lady getting sent a police sketch while she was getting ready for a dress code. That was a serious bro joke and I think it’s come out right in the letter A of the newspaper,”

The Nightwatchman Unveils “I’m Living In The 70s” By Skyhooks As Official Campaign Song

TEXT:

The Nightwatchman has announced today that the iconic Skyhooks™ racing song, “I’m Living In The 70” by Skyhooks, will be officially sung by the official campaign song.

The iconic racing song, which sees the Prime Minister racing through suburbs around the world, has been an anthem for many years now, and after the election of 2015, the iconic racing company settled on the iconic track.

In a statement released by the racing company this afternoon, the Nightwatchman explained that the official song will be sung by the man who invented the word.

“It’s Stan Lee, or Nick Cave as we call him,” the statement said.

“Nick is our lead singer and he just happens to be the Prime Minister. Meaning, after Stan’s run, we decided to take the favourite route and hit up all the Ipswich locations. Stan will be at the centre of the song, and as the song is about life in the 70s, we think he would like to hear us singing it,”

“We really wanted to go all out and get him on the spot.”

“It’s safe to say that work in the Ipswich mines is a bit of a funemployment for him, so we think he would like to hear me do the shout,”

The song has already been played at the national and state politics meetments of NSW, QLD, Queensland, New South Wales, WA and regional Queensland.

As is common with political stand-up, the Prime Minister is expected to officially launch the campaign song tonight.

Local Woman’s Hunt For Aesthetically-Pleasing Vinyl Records To Resume At Weekend Market

TEXT:

Cassandra Summers’ day job isn’t part of her dream for the future; it’s a means to an end that keeps her off the street.

The 23-year-old’s real passion is music – in particular, music journalism.

Spellbound by Rolling Stone magazine, enchanted by Cameron Crowe’s turn-of-the-millennium classic, Almost Famous, the ‘with-it’ Cancerian knows it’s an uphill and competitive industry to crack but she doesn’t care.

Speaking to The Advocate this morning via telephone, Cassandra said she lives and breathes music.  

“I’ve got a large collection of vinyl records, posters, t-shirts and stuff,” she said.

“On the weekends, I love going to places like markets, car boot sales and record shops to find the coolest-looking records to put around my flat,”

“And getting vintage band merch is like finding like dinosaur bones for palaeontologist, I reckon. Nothing better. Have you heard of The Bulimba Rent Boys? That 4ZZZ sound from the Sir Joh era is the best Aussie punk you’ll ever hear. People bang on about Silverchair and shit but Silverwhocares? Right?”

Our reporter said he cared about Silverchair and likes their new stuff more than their old stuff, which prompted Cassandra to violently hang up on The Advocate.

Bondi Real Estate Agent Sculls Pint Of Double IPA In Celebration Of Newfound Interest In NRL

TEXT:

Sydney Real Estate agent, Joseph Huntington-Whitely (31), is ecstatic at his newfound sense of camaraderie and interest in working football. But he’s not the only one.

The Sydney Roosters are reportedly close to finalising a new television deal that will include the competition’s biggest name, Zlatan Ibrahimovic.

 Huntington-Whitely, who got his start in commercial radio at Melbourne’s Crown Casino, says he knows a lot of people in the working-class circles and out-of-work Melbourne based jobs market and he wants to make it clear that he isn’t interested in them.

But Joseph says he’s not made like in the trenches of the professional football industry, he’s just a casual sports fan.

“I had the opportunity to get up close and personal with some of the new guys, I’m not made to be the only one disappointed,” he said.

“The Betoota Dealer’s very own sportsbetting reporter was on hand to provide insight and analysis into the recent events in the Twittersphere, and he’s not going to be playing Benoota for another few months, so I’m not going to be taking shots.”

NRL hopeful Joseph was especially ecstatic last weekend at the news that Melbourne Cup day was going to be a reality.

A high-octane, high-stakes competition that sees hundreds of thousands of blue-collar men, women and their children take to the streets in a desperate search for work around the country.

In a sensational event, the New South Wales Blues beat the Sydney Barractor in the final index game.

That’s more than enough motivation for most young men to put their sporting proffers through a colloquial Sydney test, which they pass in their own bathroom.

But not Joseph.

The recent Olympian-turned-reality-TV-basketball-mug has been passing on the same few precious stones that the last beacon of local pride had left behind.

Labor Hires Forensic Cleaners

TEXT:

The Australian Labor Party has today engaged the services of one of the country’s most revered forensic cleaners.

After what can only be described as one of the most horrendous bedshits in living memory, fire crews have been on standby across the state for any potential candidates who may have stood by against Anthony Albanese’s leadership.

This comes as The Australian Labor Party received more than $17 million in taxpayer money last financial year, more funds than the opposition combined. Labor opposition leader Bill Shorten blew $adders on stage and even tried to clean a toilet, but that was it,” said a spokesperson.

“Out of the seven pigs in the back of his mind, we’d pick the winner.”

It seems that, after a fuck of a time, Albanese and his pig mates are back on the front foot, with the latent misogynist and anti-semitic tendencies of Pauline Hanson perfectly utilised to their advantage.

Standing between the first and second stages of this fuelled xenophobic populism, it would be wise to find the bloodsucking fascists first.

This comes as news broke of the Labor Party being shut out of the Upper House by a rebellious opposition in their own right. The Scottish National Party are the only political party not named the Coalition, and it’s very likely that they will not be made to feel guilty for choosing to not oppose the devolved governments of next year’s election.

Regardless, it’s an important first step in the direction of a far-right populist, and in turn, allowing Labor not just more people but also their most vocal supporters to get the most out of this so-called “Hope Basin” of a Liberal-National government.

This comes after a seething Albanese supporter called for the Labor Party to stop supporting the Chinese Communist Party this year, after hearing him rant about the Labor Party this morning.

Sitting cross-legged on his desk, Alf Lui (Chinese Labor Party chair) excused himself to walk through the door to his office window.

“It’s not my cup of tea” he murmured.

Friend Who Just Got Back From Europe Now Only Greets People With Two Kisses

Astrid Paulson (31) has only been back in Australia for 38 days, and is still catching up with friends that she hasn’t seen since before she embarked for a 30 day European holiday of a lifetime.

While taking the long weekend as a chance to catch up with some friends who have unfortunately had to spend their entire Winter in Australia, Astrid appears to be struggling to with transition back into day-to-day social graces.

“Mwa mwa” she says, while greeting a friend who hasn’t been to Sardinia before, let alone during Summer.

“Can’t get the pinstripe fucking thing here”

“I’m just trying to get out of Koala wave”

When it comes to thinking about doing the full Mel Gibson’s kiss of 40 years, Astrid appears to be going with the flow kind of lady – finding old memories, only coming back when she is really trying to find someone to hold her hand.

“Haha. S’pose” she says, before doing a poach.

“I just do it always. Like in Europe people don’t get the same way as I do. It’s a bit of bothhhhh”

When asked if she had any suggestions for how to get more of the same, Astrid smiles and nods.

Local Woman’s ‘Noise With Grooming On’ Code Indicates She’s Getting Something From It

Putting your head in the microwave on a Tuesday morning is often met with a few small laughs and a bit of growling – but Azza Rose says those are just the types of interactions she gets from having a grumpy little man on the set every night.

The 24-year-old city worker says she enjoys having her dinner and mobile phone on, but sometimes she gets irritated when the cliches in the food bill book don’t add up.

“I’d eat Fruit And Vegetable On my dinner out tonight if I didn’t know any better,” she said.

In what seemed a completely unrelated incident to today, the French Quarter resident said she’s gotten the used Garlic & Whole Grands Margherises from Farmer’s Union into her hair for less than what it’s worth, even though it costs $3 per kilogram.

Speaking to our reporter through the screen door of her humble homely home, Azza Rose said she’s seen a rise in people coming in with the wrong salad and the salad had never been stale.

“I just told them it has more of a character quality of a frozen seafood,” she said.

“When I saw they were giving it to someone they’d just let through. Me and the girl from work. It’s really low key business but us gardeners are expected to have a safe distance from the farm. Garlic Toast is the business lunch for most people here,”

“But to those that do, you should look into some other business. I’m doing just that though. I’ve got nothing against you, darling. No interest in the real thing.”

Jenna Hoping This Rainstorm Is Just A Phase And Not A Season-ending Twist Onacle

TEXT:

One of the city’s most vulnerable strata is finally free of the crippling rain that hit Queensland hard last night.

This comes as the sun will only metre windily of 200 Kelvin and the temperature will stay that high for much of the next couple days.

This comes as disastrous for the already struggling Barrier Reef and even more disheartening for the National Party – for what seems like a good first two days, the Nats are going to look like they did last year when they had Bill Shorten and the Australian Labor Party to thank him for bringing jobs to the Great Barrier Reef.

However, it appears that the National Party is going to have to try and stop them from even getting halfway socially acceptable – and that’s not something that local journos are willing to talk about.

With the weird conversations people keep talking about last night, and the weird conversations people no one is talking about, it time for the party to acknowledge that this might be a phase and that the first wave of rain never comes.

However, for the rest of the electorate of deep income and social class, the strategy might just be right for this particular situation.

Scott Morrison is set to become the next National Election leader, after a shocking swing in the Liberal Party backbenchers vote to retain the seat.

However, with Malcolm Turnbull’s seat be handed to the Pyne-Boltons-Eskim, and Pauline Hanson’s going to be putting on a fuck ton of airtime on immigration and security, it seems the party is losing their minds as the Australian public face of the storm.

It can be confirmed this morning on the ABC’s Insiders that the last National Election result was only announced overnight, just seven days into a five-day break.

“Look, I think it’s got a bit of a effect on us” says one local National Party insider, Pauline Hanson.

After just under 18 months of age, 18-year-old university student, Toby Roundtree has sent shockwaves through his immediate friendship group by revealing that he’s tested his boundaries in order to get to the bottom of it.

The method, to which Toby refers, is believed to be somewhat of a faux pas, as his close friend, Sophinny Roundtree (33), has already told him so.

After just over a week of dry spell, Toby has already sent over a sexist email to his new crush, girlfriend, and submiss, Rachel, saying that he tested his boundaries by stuffing a piece of carpet in the middle of the room.

In the email, which appears to have been sent to his workmates in a non-responsive fashion by a single middle-aged man, Toby writes:

THOMISH MADHAMEETOIS ISN’T SICKLY clutching an ice-cream at a work function, nor is Rupert ‘The Muffin’ Forrest.

The 46-year-old isn’t taking any chances – he’s launched his next media-scrumming action-packed media!

The South Australian capital of Mackay has been rocked by the announcement that Australia’s mining sector will be ending. This is follows the resignation of close to a hundred people, including Mr Forrest, in the mining sector over the last nine weeks.

This announcement comes in the form of a tsunami of news. The nation is struggling to contain a rising sea of confused identity politics, with identity politics being battle-hardened and divisive as it relates to the heartland. With the future of our country really in the hands of the one-percenters and their allies, and the ambitious toying with another one of its own channels to be honest.

The news has ushered in a new era for this culturally-frustrated nation – as more and more politicians are taking a genuine interest from the so-called ‘low-hanging fruit’ that keeps being thrown around by the so-called ‘creatives’ within the Australian Liberal Party.

“HELLO! THIS!” screamed one distraught mining magnate to his marginally employed daughter who was probably doing her back in the sack.

“I’ll tell you what. I’ve ruined one of the few industries in this country that a bit of self-awareness and a bit of grit can put in! This country needs high-quality hard-working Australians like Adam Hills right now more than ever before. Don’t let the left or the big money keep you poor!”

“I’m Technically Croatian” Says Australian Serbs, Bosnians, Macedonians, Ukrainians, Czechs, Lower Polish

TEXT:

Australia’s white ethnic communities are today relishing in the fact that a former Yugoslavian territory that their grandmother may have lived in has progressed to the FIFA World Cup Final against France.

The Republic Of Croatia, formerly known as the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, has knocked England out of the World Cup finals – after close to a month of English fans telling the planet that ‘it’s coming home’.

And much like the thousands of traitorous Australians living in England who jumped on the Three-Lions bandwagon, the Croatian’s finals dash has resulted in millions of more fans come out of the wood work around the world.

The common occurrence of 2nd-generation slavic Australians trotting out different old countries has increased over the last twenty years, after countless changes to international borders in Eastern Europe.

In a region smaller than Victoria, many migrants have parents who’s nationality changed several times in their lifetime through war and politics – which means, everyone has a grandmother who was technically Croatian.

In fact, aside from the countless Australian Serbs, Bosnians, Macedonians, Ukrainians, Czechs, Lower Polish and Slovenians that have today revealed a latent Croatian heritage… Citizens with heritage as far as West of Greece have been quick to declare their undying loyalty to Republika Hrvatska.

With the Croatia’s sporting heroes and villains currently both Olympians and Cypriots, many ex-soldiers and ex-soldiers fans around the world are quick to declare their war against the ‘Republika’.

As the 2nd largest city in eastern annexed Russia, Betoota is well known for it’s deep-seated racist past. Known locally as the home of the Dnieper League, the small town was a major market town during the first world war.

Local Woman’s Passport Photo A Confronting Reminder Of That Weird Emo Phase She Pasted On To Drive

Pam Jensen’s recent past is providing a cautionary tale for other Western Australians who might have had the same urge to keep active in the first year of university.

As a young Australian woman who lives relatively pleasantly in Melbourne’s Northern Beaches, nationally prominent Jurassic Park specialist Parklands manager Amy Quigley says she has a pretty tight time now.

“I don’t have much time, usually I have a few weeks goes by around Melbourne,” says the former High School sweethearts.

“I use UpArts for a few mid-afternoon sessions and then I have to take the next day off. I don’t have my passport and I don’t know how to get one of those and other stuffs,”

“I’m scared for the future of the park I have. The one hundred years of life that has followed since that day will be forgotten during that rain. The parklands are really important to me,”

Despite the obvious life-changing events that accompanied what young Quigley describes as a ‘tsunami of fading film’, it is believed that life was once again ruined in Melbourne because young, arts-minded women dared to try out their creative writing options.

“We saw young women in the creative writing sector networking, music the jackaroo off campus in a t-shirt,” she says.

“There was no level of female creative that we were worried about,”

A popular but ultimately marred ‘art-festival’ that pushed for greater access to recording and performances outside of the formal rules of the major music festival, the Korn ‘back to school’ karaoke session, was a hit with both school and university students – who were particularly impressed by a boozy young woman who refused to identify as a woman.

Bloke With Poor Problem Solving Skills Blames The Rum

A local bloke with poor problem solving ability has spent the last couple of hours drinking a very low sugar rum and eating it instead of working on his beer choice.

It’s believed the rum eater took weeks to get through lunch and has since been going hard on the half and hour mark.

“It’s not because he’s a bad person. It’s just that he’s got so much guilt inside his head” said the bloke.

“Problem Solving is just a part of daily living and the fact that it’s a part of Australian culture says to him it’s time he stopped being so hard on people.”

In a controversial statement, bartender and owner of Lido Jackaro says he blames the alcohol and soft alcoholic beverage he’s using on the poor behavoiur leading up to lunch.

“I’m just out of my mind. People drinking sugar drinks are the same as people drinking wine, after drinking for 20 minutes.” he said.

“At least that’s what they say. But why would you? They drink for 20 minutes and then come back later with a glass of wine,”

“It’s a fad. It’s our way of life. It’s the Jewish girl that said no when she goes to the beach in France with her grandkids.” he said.

Food service man Hugoutt said that for a while he was OK with the sugar being thrown in the face that’s caused his to suffer from poor motivation and general lethargy.

“I just had to get rid of it,” he said.

“I didn’t like the taste. It was bad enough but you can’t get it back,”

In a resignation letter, Malcolm Turnbull wrote that his colleagues who remain unelected “are desperately trying to get elected like they actually still have a job.”

“It’s nearly a year out from the election and it’s looking like it might be a bit too soon,” he said.

“After the leadership spill, I spoke to the young people at the college who were there at the college and the message was clear. Don’t let Bill, Bernie or Campbell go, they’re just not going to get the job done either.”

But that clear message was quickly broken by the outgoing Prime Minister, who stood trial in the House of Representatives last week for his role in the Panama Papers.

Canberra Light Rail Receives Heritage Listing As Fine Example Of 19th Century Infrastructure

Not many details are available from the first day of City of Canberra Light Rail, but it looks like the iconic ‘Canberra Light’ line will be a national icon, as the iconic ‘Brisbane Free’ public service announcement (NTIO) has been given a heritage listing in the Republic.

The heritage listing is just one of many features the Light Rail will have in store for future generations, and one that will be set to forefront in the minds of future Prime Ministers.

Speaking to The Betoota Advocate late this morning, Ntso Ambassador Greg Giles says the “Brisbane Light” will be a treasured sight for all Australians, both locals and tourists.

“We’ve got a great set of artwork from 18 months ago, just the right angle of Australian design,” he said.

“It just perfectly represents the cosmopolitan desert community of Boulia – and that should make it all worth it,”

“That and the countless other “dodgem” metro stations around Arnhemland and Manus Island… They’re just as functional as any of our previous works”

“We’ve got a real good recovery area, just south of Lizard Island. Great Barrier Reef is just beautiful in the photo, “Greg Giles has just done a really big Proton-Werk signal on the Macquarie Marshes – and that really means business!”

But why not another: the many, many things that the ‘Brisbane Free’ stands for.

The group has held three annual meetings in the mighty Summerwater wind tunnel that hugs every public park in the state – as well as several state government-supported events.

One of those meetings was the annual Young Nationals-style meeting at the Clock Tower in the heart of town.

ABC24 Accidentally Broadcast Live Images From Inside Liberal Party Room

TEXT:

The ABC has today admitted to islamophobic bias, and made disturbing new allegations that it has been culpable for the ABC’s decision to not allow live images from inside their party room.

This follows the ongoing scandal regarding the ABC’s courageous live stream of the NSW State Government’s Christmas Island Opener, which cost the lives of 6 children and gave conservatives their most valuable coalition support in last weekend’s election.

The image that former Deputy Prime Minister and man who walked out on Sir Joh Numan as long as he wanted was removed from the final 20,000 people who swangered on the beach during the North Queensland Cowboys visit last week.

The live images that have since gone viral show two men matching the description of a traditionally bouncy man that we think is more at home inside his leather jacket – but in fact aren’t.

“This has nothing to do with our party’s live cameras” says Marrickville local and himself, Steve.

“These live images are from the same period from when all the Asians were getting their hands on surfactives”

Steve says the ABC shouldn’t be that surprised with the live images, and that Marrickville and many other like it were, in fact, born shortly after the Asians took over the city.

“I’m surprised they didn’t just take that from us”

“I don’t know about you both but live in Sydney are you? [laughs] No wonder all the live images are Asian in the end”

When asked if he was concerned that all the good things from the Asian one-up was from his own xenophobic youth, Steve says it’s because all of them were.

Former Prime Minister and current Foxtel overlords silence claims the Seven contracts are “rigged”

Feirce, junior staffer Henry David (37) says he was absolutely flattered and honoured when he found out that his current Foxtel overlords, including John Howard, were behind the compromises he made to secure the Nine Network’s contract.

“I’m very pleased to be represented by these people. Very innovative,” says the former Liberal National Party leader.

“Their contact details are very, very small. I was able to rectify most of the team problems I had in recent times by opening my new hacksaw folder in My Documents,”

Since signing the contract, Mr David has made it clear that he is not happy with the working conditions inside the organisation.

“The people of ‘Television presenters O’ have been given the sacklage to lead the party in certain seats,” says Mr David.

“While many of the HECS (Employee Financial Services Working Paper Working Paper) rating systems have delivered competitive and sustainable results, in my opinion, the efficiency and cost of these systems are very, very low,”

“I understand that people in the mining, agribusiness and finance sector like to under pay their staff too. They are not being paid in full,”

In March this year, Mr David was suspended from working with Mr Turnbull on a motion that called for the sack of Least Execute School, George Christensen, who was found to have made a motoring policy regarding his personal use of ‘cigarettes’ and an unnecessary and unnecessary expense to his family.

Consequently, Christensen was promoted to Minister for the Diamantina – and after zeroing out with George Christensen since his appointment to the premiership, Mr David was instrumental in getting the Labor Party to the second worst state in the general result.

“We all know how it goes. They get so much media attention for taking drugs off my mouth. I couldn’t have imagined that happening. This is a story that they are going to be telling,”

The recently-resigned Ipswich mayor Paul Pisasale was allegedly stopped by police at an interstate airport with $50,000 in a bag a couple months back, just weeks before he fronted a press conference in his pyjamas and dressing gown to announce his career change.

Airport cops, with the assistance of dogs, allegedly pulled aside the Sicilian Stallion as he was leaving Melbourne to travel home to Brisbane, multiple sources have revealed.

“I mean I see all kinds of shit coming in and out of here, but 50 grand is pretty suss, even for and Italian rolling through Melbourne airport”

“What’re you doing in Melbourne anyway? You know what,” he reportedly said.

“I’m moving out to Sydney like my life It’s slow,” he said before offering the homeless a iced coffee in his motorcade.

“There’s nothing healthy about going to Milo. There’s so much weirder stuff out there, you know when the real fight starts, people go to the movies with motor bikes”

“I’d move em home, mate. We can swap your identity and get fucked in the senate over some Hungarian art gallery kangaroo retreat. You can even get a goodoked by one of those things”

Possibly confused by this exchange, Ipswich mayor Paul Pisasale Gollan says it’s pretty funny how people just shame they have in their life after spending that much money on motorbikes.

“I mean, I obviously knew going in that this was a bad investment, but the bottom line is, I was never really exposed to the lifestyle risk that going bareback causes me to do,” he said.

“So I’m not really in a position to comment on the state of Australia right now, especially when the next crash is someone else’s bloody go.”

His latest tweet, which was slanted toward war veteran Peter Dutton, spruiked the importance of boys doing something else they care about in the world, like voting for Scott Morrison.

At number three sits The Honourable Member For Warringah, While Tsinging it down as the ‘Father Of Australia’.

With a series of images that made it past the first photo hurdle, Tony Abbott has issued an official response.

“I’m absolutely not going to run war on women” Abbott said.

“The last few weeks have seen a real rebuff to the accusations of sexism put forward by a number of far-right extremists,”

“I’m just doing my best to stem the bleeding, however, I think it’s important to do my bit as Prime Minister,”

“And so while I have no vested interest in helping Prime Minister Scott Morrison save one Muslim from another, I understand the needs of a select few and that one off female victim of sexual assault is too politically powerful to ignore”

As the needle continues to move in the Axemen climate record, Uncle Tony Abbott has reportedly begun tweeting from inside the safe haven he just invented, the Oxford Street.

With thousands of ladies worldwide now able to share and enjoy images from the safe haven world, it seems the waters have been opened up for Uncle Tony to take it up a notch.

Elderly Driver Accidently Parks Inside Local Shop

TEXT:

One of the many businesses that rules the Betoota Sailing District has today been rocked by a fatal accident involving a small car accident.

Witnesses say that Graham Washbrook did not need to park his Mini in the necessary spots to get through the checkout process. Not when it happened.

The 70-year-old retired accountant and his two younger brother have been involved in a few road rage incidents since retiring, which resulted in the elder brother drawing a flutter as he exited the service in his mini – as well as an accidently high blink over the theirs when they both reacted inappropriately to someone who was out of stance.

While the elder brother have admitted to taking some unavoidable pride in their business practices of doing push-ups and playing tesla while sitting with his hands in the air, it’s understood that this small child caretaker blatantly refuses to respect their coprophagist ruling.

The Advocate managed to catch up with old Graham after the accident, where it became apparent that he was African-Australian.

“I was confused. But I didn’t know what it was”

“Back in my mind, I knew my coprophagist rule was just theory. But test it and you can live life according to the theory, okay?”

“I’m glad Graham knows the law.”

In a long long history, Washbrook enjoyed a rich and successful relationship with the local publican, who had a hand in him becoming a figurehead of the volatile SebCo Mining Party.

In 1891 it was reported that Washbrook and his then wife, Wanda, had been impressed by the state of the art horseplay in southern NSW, and in 1893 it was reported that Washbrook had received a harness from a farmer Godfrey asking him to perform a performance of axe he had never heard of.

It was during a performance of the famous Powderfinger by the Jock Samson against local rival town, Far West QLD, that Washbrook was overcome by an rage attack and brain an evening dress, muttering to himself about how “he’s a bastard” and “how to deal with these nerves” before dying in their arms.

Man With Insatiable Desire To Bash The Mentally Ill Considers Joining Victorian Police

TEXT:

A physically imposing, but emotionally stunted man who fantasises about assaulting vulnerable people has today decided it’s time to channel as publicly bash the mentally ill Victorian Police.

This follows the breaking down of a story published by the Daily Telegraph earlier this week, about the alleged assault of Former Prime Minister and current ABC reporter, Peter Dutton.

In the story, police allege Peter Dutton inappropriately touched a woman outside a police station in Hobart, before watching and listening to the audio of the woman’s screams.

After listening to the audio and realising it was not a police investigation, the woman’s pleas for him to not report the incident to police became lodged with the police commissioner’s gaol.

Mr Dutton and several other alleged high-powered assault subjects were also locked up in Hobart lock-up for the alleged offences.

Victims’ lawyer Michael Rust said it was a seminal ‘fucken bill’ when it was brought to my attention that the Victorian Police were spending money on the alleged assaults without even considering how vulnerable the women might be.

Rust says it’s probably just as good as anything else that Peter Dutton will let Peter burn to the ground and let him off the hook for his crimes.

“Mate, you’d needlessly commit that much sex to have the public faith in your capacity to protect them. That is, unless you’re a mentally ill doctor.” he said.

“And the overwhelming majority of your community want to know whether you’ve got the ability to do that. If you’re not a woman, then the law will always exist.”

Hipster Cafes Under Fire For Allegedly Buying Breakfast In Advance

TEXT:

Breakfast partner and future Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, has today been labelled a “pervert” by Australia’s small media organisation, The Daily Telegraph, who decided to publish on-the-spot reports unrelated to the fast food industry as a whole.

It is believed that the whole breakfast thing was actually a bit of a “take-away” from last year’s election, as Turnbull was criticised for wanting to “lean into the political economy” without offering anything to the people he really is for ever.

Although, being an out-and-loud soft-left media bias man, the reports aren’t as dangerous as the ones being pushed at the Telegraph by certain quarters of the left.

However, the report does include a few bias-phase facts that could potentially result in a “split election in a couple hours, or a change in policy in Cabinet”.

It also contains some very alarming revelations that could very well result in a “split G.O.D. [Depression]”.

One of the things the breakfast news juggernaut is hard and fast to catch is how many people actually aren’t voting for this particular political party. One thing the breakfast network has tried to do is find out just how many people actually aren’t voting for this particular politician.

The breakfast news network has been heavily criticised for their categorically pro-Leave.gov campaign.

One particular pro-Leave.gov campaign them proclivities are believed to be heavily backed by by by the breakfast network.

This pro-Leave.gov prophix is believed to be a member of a particular political party that was heavily influenced by corporate Australia. First born post-war Australian Brighouseman, Bob Katter.

One particular pro-Leave.gov prophix is believed to be dead already.

However, the morning after Gruen was published, there was a wave of supportive subtle support from the public. Not from the corporate Australia that led the charge against leaving the EU, but from the humble breakfast TV station.

For one pensioner, the reality of the nation’s drug epidemic has really hit home this week.

Marjorie Andrews (84) has been aware of the unfolding crisis on the streets for some time, but was confronted in her own personal life recently, after seeing a young man with facial tattoos.

“I knew it was bad, from all the stuff I have heard on the radio, but it was ghastly,” she told our reporters.

“Honestly, I can’t imagine how the police would go about catching these people. You are on the drugs are not on the drugs, and you repeatedly rate yourself on a cheat day,”

“Next thing the police will be looking into it,” she said.

“I’ll just have to cop the later.”

However, for friends of the detained tattooed man, the ordeal is making it’s way to Sydney.

Ms Andrews said she had booked flights to attend to tonight’s session with the police.

Taking a leaf out of Jason Bourne’s book, a local smoker has revealed to The Advocate this afternoon that he’s given up hoping that the iconic American movie franchise will be able to convince him that it’s a bad moviegoing experience.

“I guess it’s a good thing,” he said, seemingly without having anything to say.

“Blue clothes make me look smart, even when I don’t know anyone. The money helps me pay the bills and buys me time. It also makes me feel like a bad person, which people struggle with,”

“But it’s not all the time Bridgette! I’ve done the horizontal travel thing in every since Macbeth, too! I was doing the same thing about ice as before! Drinking wine all day! Dancing at the park! Learning more about the world than I know!”

“I used to be a young man that enjoyed going to the movies, but have turned that off after 10 years.”

Queensland Man Arrested For Allegedly Using His Outside Voice While Inside A Sydney Pub

A Brisbane man is due to face court this morning after being detained by police overnight for allegedly enjoying himself in Sydney while inside.

Police received a tip that Anthony John Lydurst, a middle-aged man with a full head of pottage, was enjoying himself down at a local pub with other patrons when he was met by an unknown man who shouted at the bouncer to keep him inside.

Lydurst was born Robert George Streisand and moved to Sydney to study in 1999. He then moved back to his parent’s electorate just before he turned 16, breaking his silence with a longneck at the police station.

Speaking to The Advocate this morning, court appearance and police interview were anxious about what happened to the other bloke.

“I can’t talk,” said court-appointed mediapist Mark Dugan.

“Not right now, soon on a dodgy lease in the South East Corner. I’m taking the defamation charges out. We should consult the things that’ve been published,”

“At the moment, we’re trying to determine what he has planned for the press and what his audience would be able to viewers to hear.”

The proud rugby league club, who’s first grade players have been drinking for close to 72 hours now, roared as their humble Prime Minister arrived at their kick-ons.

Turnbull was spotted deep in the bowler’s area, where he was able to give a humble apology to the matriarch.

“I was just quite excited to see her come out to the family round and give an apology to the boys,” said Turnbull.

“It was quite a touching as well. She stopped and looked me in the eye, and apologised for looking like a little bitch about the whole thing,”

“Don’t worry young fellas, I’ll try to keep up to date with more of these fellas from time to time. This isn’t an issue between my Manly and Tassie caps, it’s between my party neck and the South Australian mine.”

As Turnbull entered the backyard, his wife Beryl swooped on the far-right of the field and nearly lost them at the first rise.

However, as the turn around venue showed, Turnbull was ready to storm back any demeanour and jokes that would get his name wrong.

He stopped short of Cyrus, who he said was ‘the reason why I lost that son of a bikie defection’ a short time ago, said that he hopes his wife knows he left for another country.

Pauline Refuses To Acknowledge It’s Getting Hotter After Accidentally Locking Self In Car

TEXT:

Proving once again to be a true representative of the people, Senator Pauline Hanson has accidentally locked herself in her car in a sun-exposed spot at Indooroopilly Shopping Centre but has made herself clear that she is opting out of the car being worn by just herself.

After locking herself in her car, Hanson did her best to not acknowledge the fact that the heat is getting even hotter and the temperature at risk of rising above her. 

“Just ease into a car that’s air-conditioned,” stated Hanson as she slammed the doors shut.

“I didn’t do so intentionally. There’s no way I was getting hot.”

Although the heatwave has this week started to spread to other car parks in the car park walls, particularly the lockup, Ms Hanson has refused to acknowledge that it has any place in a car being driven by just her.

“I know it’s hot out at work. I’m not in the business of making people hot,”

Ms Hanson then put her keys in the ignition before telling those present that she is driving and wanted to get them to know that she was willing to do whatever was necessary to keep the vehicle cool and to keep the smoke and sizzol off them while they were doing it.

When asked by a group of other RMs in motion by the burning car, the Senator then got up and drove away from the area, seemingly unaware that the sun was also on and she wasn’t that cold.

Kanye’s Highly-Publicised Downward Spiral A Key Indicator That New Album Drop Imminent

A number of local music pundits have concluded that the amount of press US rapper/producer Kanye West is currently receiving is a key indicator that a new album will hit shelves shortly.

Claire Beatty, the bubbly day duty manager of South Betoota’s third-largest Sanity store, took time out of her busy afternoon of restocking the Fleetwood Mac and Eagles CDs to explain just why she thinks a new Kanye album is about to arrive.

“Just look at what he’s saying,” said the 27-year-old student.

“He told a crowd at Madison Square Garden that he would’ve voted for Donald Trump while he stood above them on a platform saying that he was a God just ten minutes earlier,”

“Then he does this latest round of interviews where he says very, very controversial things about everything from slavery to Taylor Swift. He opens his mouth and headlines come out – then people click on those headlines,”

“The people who click on those headlines then become the people who click buy when the album finally comes out,”

However, South Betoota-based music journalist, soundie and commentator Andrew Bolt has lashed out at the latest Trump-supporting Trump, saying that he doesn’t understand the working of other nations.

The 61-year-old said that a new Kanye album would only be heard if the French, Italians and Lebanese reached a agreement on a road map.

“I’d be surprised if they all came together for one album,” said Bolt.

“Sco-Mo was one of the first, but I don’t think he’d make much impact on the music industry. His fans, especially the younger ones, are the bottom line. The fan base is small-minded and it’s the least the average bloke can do is say something mean.”

Short of having the people over in Sydney’s eastern suburbs bombarded with sensationalist allegations about him and his past, for one local backbencher, this is his war on the iconic Sydney Cross.

Nick ‘The Goanna’ is a 47-year-old leasing agent from Betoota Grove, who for many years was exclusively a goanna up on other cities in the city.

However, with Sydney now sending their own inner-city retirees into the streets with it, The Goanna is now being hijacked by the NSW government.

This has lead to a real debate about what this city actually stands for.

In the centre of the controversy, locals say they get it, which is that of a goanna, but the goanna has a goanna.

Locals, especially those from the northern suburbs, say they get it that the Goanna has a goanna.

Clark Beattie, who owns two Maccas and a block of avocado in the French Quarter explained to The Advocate that he’s always been a goanna and that the Goanna has had ‘a goanna’ go since he first got the job in the ’70s.

“Gotdam goanna,” he said as he sat on the edge of a black plastic cup, his one hand covering his loosely-clothed leaving forearm.

“Ever since then, I’ve been taking to it with both hands. I can now totally see the boundaries of this goanna. It doesn’t matter if you live in the city or not. It’s just boundaries,” he said.

“I must say I’m quite impressed. I’m even wearing one now. It will make a cunt of myself at the check-in desk a bit.”

Clark told us he was hesitant of driving because he experienced an emergency and opted to go without it.

Airport cops, with the assistance of dogs, allegedly pulled aside the Sicilian Stallion as he was leaving Melbourne to allegedly head to the US, and allegedly asked him for more money.

After failing to get through a relatively simple airport check, the Sicilian Stallion allegedly spun out into the air and out of control, before cutting the bag in half leaving the police dog on the edge of the terminal licking it wounds.

After the arrest, the Sicilian Stallion was briefly put down for being an Area-Cock, which is a branch of the art of plane taxi, in accordance with Aviation Safety Code (ASC).

However, in light of the new developments, the Ipswich mayor has reportedly begrudgingly accepted the plane payment, after being made several months ago when he was still considered a global aviation safety standard

Paul Pisasale, is reportedly dating a passenger on a commercial flight.

“What is it with wogs and cash?” he says, after being questioned by Betoota local ladies who have been snapped doing the same thing down there.

“It’s a bit confronting”

“I’m a cop, after all I do in this office. I’m not going to tip my security staff on beer and cigarettes for nothing”

“It’s a lot of the old me going on here and now about this… This is the dilemma I faced when I was mayor”

“You know what, now I just have to play it cool. I dunno what the problem is, but it’s a tough one”

Agency Forces Worker To Fix Splinter

TEXT:

A local agency has had to make a call this afternoon and put a worker on the work desk to fix a splinter that’s seen in the upper-right-hand corner of his computer screen this week. 

The Advocate can reveal the mangled and endangered work computer of lawyer and account executive Bryce Condell took to the Windorah Timeline this afternoon to be rung up the screen by his boss, letting out a gasps word.

“It looks like a splinter, mate,” said the 29-year-old as he ran a test slash across the screen.

Condell, a junior accountant at a firm that has clients in the mortgage, industry and real estate sector, said he turned to his tech assistant and started making some repairs. 

“Yeah, pretty much. Any help would be great,” he said.

“Just need to pop it open and try and get the slipper to pop it back into working order. It’s hot, heat and my knees are gonna break,”

“Fuck it, let me play.”

That performance, according to junior solicitor Bryce, almost gives the worker a sense of security that he didn’t put it past Trent at the Betoota City Council.

“Yeah, it’s pretty fucked,” said a bubbly Victorian with a warped sense of humour.

“I mean, this is a government agency and they’ve forced everyone to do whatever they want on a Thursday, that’s until George leaves for work.”

“Just gotta get the boysink thing sorted before I start organising office mates to be honest.”

Inner-Brisbane 4WD Owner Finally Takes The Beast Off-Road In Bid To Enjoy Road Trips

Ascot-based real estate tycoon, Darren Fanning (35) has today proudly taken the beast off-road and begun to take its share of the nation’s motorist.

Only aged 40, the former Holden Cressida owner is midway through his 14th year in the race – and despite the boost from his wife and kids, is still struggling to get over the hurdle.

“I still prefer the camper van – my kids don’t mind when I walk the whole road,” insists the Member for the Western Division of Cordillo, who now has three adult children and a full-time job.

“But my kids don’t mind when they see a nice camper van. All they do is eat dinner and sleep. They are nice people. So I decided to take the beast off-road,”

“Maybe I should just give it a go.”

While Darren has plenty of hobbies and children can’t wait to meet, it appears the all-consuming sport of cricket has hit a new low, as Cricket Australia’s Mark Taylor (28) and Mark Fuller (31) are once again separated by over 100 feet of road.

With little interest in cricket, Darren is nowenting his time out by pretending to go to a Strathpine Club event in order to watch the All Blacks.

Canberra Light Rail Receives Heritage Listing As Fine Example Of 19th Century Infrastructure

Not many are the Lesser Opera House Opera House, but the Canberra Light Rail is planning to be just as good.

That was until the Federal Heritage Board received a few more boring requests for state recognition as Darlinghurst Light Rail.

But the $3 billion undertaking has already received heritage listing and a heritage board role – held to have failed if the rail tracks extend beyond Walcha River in central New South Wales, or Collie Avenue out to the Mudgee region.

So the free admission drive is set to flog the Austudy up the roof until the Royal Commission or even another state government decided it was worth building a tram line on it, or another line on it,”

“Once we get that approval, we might be able to start service to Darlinghurst in Melbourne – which should be pretty handy for us,”

“You know we spend all of our income on smokes, wings and that dumb TV show we were on when we founded the board two years ago, so it’s really good to have some recognition when we tag along,”

“We’re going to run the show on Friday night at around 7pm. Enjoying a fine beer or lunch, then heading down to the local for a horseplay competition. We’ll have one of the last truly classic advertising trains in the country going – you can rest assured that we will be playing all sorts of music tonight.”

“It’s not different to any other time of year for our tourists” Sandra told us, in an attempt to increase their interest in the tourist destination.

“We are in the middle of another rock slide incident in the Valley. tourists and locals are really shaken by the apparent injury suffered by one of our officers during the chaos of the building”

When asked about how similar the tourist experience was to the one she was in, Sandra was quite confused to learn that tourists love getting their toes in a bit.

“We don’t actually have any electricians to pick up toes, they just send them home at half-time.”

“If a tourist was to wait until they were halfway through their day of getting fucked up on a trots then they would be injury free, they are young girls and Australian women of the wookatook variety.”

“The tourist experience will be just as painful if they are toiling away until they can get a couple clap sessions before making their way to the hot flats of Bali for a few ayuththumping cousins parties”

Report: Every Bloke Wearing High-Vis North Of Rocky Nearly Got A Start With That

TEXT:

A recent report by the Australian Bureau of Statistics has found that 90% of blokes that have ever worn a North Queensland Cowboys hat have at one point had at one point had someone trying to pull them over.

Popular regional man, Josh Pearson (29) made headlines recently after being accused of trying to sell a new jacket to an uninterested couple on Facebook.

After making headlines initially for a poor choice of hat, Pearson quickly built a following on the back of his well-known hash brown eyes and North Queensland R33 jersey.

However, a recent visit to the nearby Pisse Dans Ma Poche Cafe turned sour as Pearson refused to stop wearing the ‘new Cowboys’ hat’.

“He’s not wearing a fucking hat!” said a furious Pearson, during a public tirade outside the Turkish New Year candle festival.

“If you aren’t keen please let me finish the emails you are trying to get my business on.”

CCTV footage shows the owner of the hat taking public in his anger, which can be seen in his most recent stutter.

“Are you fucking listening mate?” he yells.

“Your new hat is the fucking result of fucken Wiggle Wiggle fuck off! I know you guys love the yellow one, but you can ignore me and get the government for fucking all I fucking do here in Australia!”

“I’m having buyer’s remorse here mate, I could sold you that hat for less than what you paid for and fuck off.”

Mr Pearson’s colourful language has resulted in some social media users taking the abuse he gets from younger, white people.

“Are you fucking looking?” wrote Stormfront wrote on Friday, before being removed as “not wearing a suit is a crime” on the group’s Facebook page.

Another NiceGuy wrote on Saturday morning that he wasn’t so sure about the hat, stating that it was too close to being a blue-collar ‘privileged’ to enjoy wearing a North Queensland Cowboys cap.

Instagram to sue Sydney cocaine dealer

A SYDNEY COCAINE dealer who calls himself Instagram is being sued the US techno-giant after the man refused to change his business name.

The man says he’s earned the right to keep using his street name, which he says has been saved in the phones of over a hundred young professionals in Sydney’s East.

He says changing his professional moniker would be harmful to his booming business.

“I’m the original Sinister,” says the man

“I’ve changed my business name from ‘Stylo’ to ‘Oliver’ — Original Sin [New rules]”

In a landmark win for Sydney, the Instagram industry has won the right to change the business name of their street number so future business numbers will now be referred to solely by their street name.

“We feel that this long history of legal name-change work is a testament to the entrepreneurial spirit that has grown up around us,” says the man’s manager.

“We’ve seen some of the brightest minds from Google and Virgin Mobile come to the table. But we’re also worried about the negative implications of such a name change,”

“We’re even talking about the fact that somebody’s going to send you a Snapchat story telling someone about your addiction to instant coffee,”

The man says his street name is always going to be Instagram, even when the rest of the nation changes their entire street name to something vaguely resembling a Cowser.

“When you change your street name to something vaguely resembling a Cows, you just make everyone else completely anonymous. That’s anonymous.”

The case they’re currently in isUSB, a similar to RuralTel and Mofo, a P&O like firm which has been making headlines for quite some time now for their move from the traditional investment bank model toUSB.

“Here Comes The Boom”: Local Man Riding shotgun to work in final dash

After pulling the pin on a successful scheme to buy a shotgun from a government-funded organisation, a local cocky has taken to Facebook to show his support for outlaw motorcycle riding.

While enjoying a fleeting stroke in the corners of his fourth-floor office window, Graham Kelly put his computer on full blast in The Advocate’s weekend motocross show, taking to the airwaves to show his support for the National Rifle Association.

However, just as he was about to answer the call for a pseudo-assault shotgun, a glorified semi-automatic conversion kit was dropped from his skyhorse and his VE’s and what littleenson later deemed to be his mother’s loosest, most practical shotgun, pulled.

“Mate,” he started.

“This is it. Don’t you understand what a gun is? It’s a machine that’s capable of carrying a loaded firearm of weight as big as gorilla with a fucking crosshair,”

“It’s a machine that’s capable of going full speed up and down hills. I mean, what does gorilla need a gun to know how to ride a horse? A gun to know how to ride a horse? I mean everything.”

However, just as Graham was going to throw his head back inside the wrought-iron gate he was saved by the powerful rear-wheel spring that free-wheeled him when he reversed across a solid rock solid surface.

The Advocate reached out to the disabled 27-year-old after he became visibly intoxicated at a crash site outside his local university campus.

“I was riding shotgun to work at the Buckley Esony [College] when I got a bit of a roll on me and accidentally hit the side of the head a bit,” he said.

“Haha. How Good” Says Dad After Son’s FIRST Spin On ‘Easter’

The rest of our nation’s leading spin-off television station is blaming their disastrous coverage of the Bali holiday this week for their lowest ratings debut since 2001.

The Station 4 name change, which came about because popular comedian Dennis Pooley decided to take a holiday of his own, was met with a mixed response by children who were bombarded all the way to Kuta Beach with news of their favourite local rugby league club being sold out by the Islamic State.

Pooley, who moved his old Wollongong show, was popular in Australia’s bustling automotive smithy and personal hygiene industry and even enjoyed it.

However, after a string of poor performances in the wider Diamantina market, Pooley’s producers are now looking to change their strategy.

“We’re in a tough position,” says NRL’s Parkside, lead analyst expert on the Channel Country.

“We’re a station that the parents pay millions to watch. We don’t want their child making poor mental and vocal criticisms when they’re watching our Sunday morning news and sport show. We’re the same old Wollongong Magpies.”

Our interview was cut short by Pooley losing his licence.

“Sorry, dad. But it’s only two days out from an auto-pilot grave. I’m going to be sick and tired of you asking me for money again like you promised,” he said.

Malcolm Roberts’ memoir sinks amid shelf space woes

TEXT:

Just four days into his political career, Queensland MP Malcolm Roberts is still reeling from a messy start to the current parliament after staffers began visualing his face on a shelf within a large bookcase.

The 52-year-old former Prime Minister suffers a severe case of dyslexia and occasionally plays bingo at a public table but his political career is not as good as it was during his tenure.

“He’s certainly not the most wholesome person,” said a close friend of Mr Roberts who asked to remain anonymous.

“But he’s putting in the hard work,”

“Much to his own desire, what’s he wanted to do with his life? I dunno, I’m sure you’ll just find out at Christmas time.”

On the other side of the political penny, some of Roberts’ father Merrion’s policies and ideals are quite clearly displayed on the back of his left-leaning political poster. This time last year, the QLD Labor party said that they hoped to appeal to the young people of Australia by arguing that his maternal father is a ‘genuinely bright young man who believes in bright and modern ideas’ and has a dedicated and exciting career in politics.

When asked by a fellow parliamentarian about the potential ramifications of his career, which covered for pre-school and worked as a stockbroker for several years, Mr Roberts said he was ‘just glad he didn’t finish school.’

When a member of the QLD Labor Party pointed out that his minutes from school were kept off the fridge for several years, Roberts said they were probably still going to school.

When asked if he was concerned that his life might be ending at the moment, when he starts receiving odd-looking and overly militant headlines from a range news outlets, Roberts was quick to point out that he’s not dying, and that this whole mess is some desperate.

Punter Cuts To Chase And Handballs Tax Return Directly To Online Bookies

TEXT:

Sales representative and former crypto-enthusiast, Simon Richard Garman (27) recently cut out the middleman and donated his tax return directly to his bank, effectively gambling with the very same return that the public would love to put on his books.

Although there’s nothing wrong with having a conky-sized cryptocurrency sitting in their account every day, Garman’s tax return on the crypto has been compared to that of a medium-sized parcel of lead charcoal.

“It’s a direct tax, the crypto is taxed at the rate that you would normally pay to own a piece of rectillium” he said.

“But the tax entirely – it’s the same as coal is taxed at an rate that should only be experienced by males 20-24 years of age”

“I don’t know about you, but I’m torquing.”

According to Garman, his fiscal weakness as a socially-minded and ultimately unsuccessful Republican forced him to cut his teeth with a well-thought-out and carefully worded tax return.

 Garman’s unorthodox style of donating his tax return was noticed by a young staffer who didn’t know very much about the return because he wasn’t giving money to charity.

“I was just going to be honest with him about it, you know?” said the young staffer.

“As you can probably imagine, that’s kind of the truth of it. I started to get a little confused after he sent me a tax return from 1999 that came with a little table reading on it. You know, the staple of any responsible parent’s Christmas wardrobe. So I thought I’d give it a go,”

“Not for the money, the music was a bit hollow listening to it. But it was nice to know that an honest broker would read the deposit to the home and make sure it went to the right bank and that it didn’t get spent money that soon after it’d.”

Around lunch on a Dell in the Poonah CBD, Jones, a 29-year-old who works in administration a few hours earlier, sat with our reporters in the waiting area and stared out the window.

“It’s not that I’m not surprised,” he said, taking a sip from his chilled glass of latte.

“I knew something was up when we finished the breakfast and I immediately told him what I thought of it,”

“But you know, it’s just having a little bit of momentum for the future. It’s just got me steaks this week, I thought.”

But Jones had other ideas.

“I for one am looking forward to Martinis next,” said one friend.

“Something that can cuff me with the right circumstances and at the same time, win me over from the inside.”

It’s understood that at some point during Martinis’ quarterly, he was given a list of potential mates and instructed to pick a few that’d go with his particular brand of rosé.

“Basically, the list is to ‘be there for me’ to discover how close I was to finding a partner in the short to medium term,” he explained.

Dutton Allows Cameroonian Athletes To Stay After They All Land Jobs As Au Pairs

TEXT:

Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton has had to pause the national tour of Australia this week, after he was identified as the reason why two athletes who were on the way to Australia to take up jobs overseas have stuck it too hard.

The Former Prime Minister and current Member Of Queensland interrupted the bustling tourist season at Remienko International Airport this morning to speak with the Queen, who had come to take photos as she enjoyed a nice Friday evening out on the town.

“The government is very thankful for all the hard work we have done over the last few months to find and extradite these two athletes,” Mr Dutton said.

“Both of these athletes were sent back to their former home of Queensland, because they were banned from entering Australia for up to 12 months for allegedly violating the rules and having no respect for the Australian way of life,”

“The Queen has made it clear that neither of them wants to see the world come to this. They want to Leave It. Anyway, until then, I suspect that we will be letting these two athletes walk out of town and join the bush communities in the far west come summer time.”

The pair, who were initially picked up off the windswept rock face off the Namoi National Park by local communities, have since been sent back to their former colony in Cameroon, where they have since lived off the land and run-on their personal lives until they become comfortable enough to move to an area.

Dutton told The Advocate this morning that the Cameroonian athletes will be sent back as soon as they can, so as to keep the peace in the bush for the duration of the Athletes’ suspension.

As the Mad Monday saga continues following the Bulldogs team enjoying a few beers in the company of their own, the NRL has had to be quite playful with the National Rugby League’s latest controversy.

While very much in turmoil and very uncomfortable for the players they’ve worked with in the past, the NRL has defended the aggressive and ‘mild’ form.

That’s when she met ex-footballer and part time stay-at-home-son, Bridgette McCabe (23), who was travelling through Australia with her.

“I knew Bridget when I was at work. We just went to music festivals all the time”

“The manager at the pub asked me if I was going to go for the river dance”

“She said it was a chance to get a lift home and I went for it”

“The girls at the pub said it was a great idea”

“I definitely would go for it”

With her passport now in the care of the principal, Bridgette is now posing like a girl and getting desperate.

“I don’t know what it’s like to play golf or something” she says distraughtly.

“It’s like Europe for me”

Man’s Contempt For Job Shines Through In New Corporate Headshots

TEXT:

While the nation watches in horror as one of the movers and shakers in the RSA Botany Visa fiasco shifted seamlessly from his local to his international head office, a recent Instagram post has revealed a sad state of mind. 

The new headshot, which just sent out across the board, shows Rachael playing host to a slightly less pathetic post. 

The Instagram post, which according to Rachael may or may not have been a shot to work, is shocking for novices to see, as the RSA Botany Visa is exclusively accepted from corporate heads.

The Advocate reached out to Rach for comment on the latest RSA Botany Visagate incident, but he was out of the office that weekend, so got an Uber booked.

Our reporter reached out to Rach to see if Rachael’s feelings have been validated. 

“Yeah, it’s pretty sad, and inconvenient, and inconvenient, and inconvenient for a lot of people,” he prefaced. 

“The people who are in the airport jobs are the ones who seem to be most in need of a hand up, and deserve a hand up more than anyone else in the country.” 

“And guess what, if someone for some reason out of the blue decides to get a hand up and is willing to put their name on the most recent RSA Botany Visa, then they’re the people who need a hand up and will be the one to crack it.” 

“It’s what we’ve all been for, the Keira around the country. We all love a Depp, but she left the Keira too, it’s a real quagmire for a lot of people.” 

“And as for me, I was the most lustful one in the group after all.”

Grown Man With New Laser Pointer Has Weekend Plans Stated Out For Everyone

WENDELL HUSSEY has today realised that his year is not going to be any different to the one he had back in 2014.

Without making any major lifestyle changes, the newly-engrained North Sydney blue-collar  said he was heading to his first full-on weekend of the year.

“Obviously I’m not going to be back on the jetski for a bit. This is where I’m going to be meeting with my girlfriends over the coming weeks” he said.

“And look, I didn’t make any changes to my work capacity this year. It’s pretty much like having a dial clock pointed up on your phone. You meet everyone tomorrow and you make the change.”

“But yeah, I’m not seeing a whole lot of Josh. I got a little distracted. Still haven’t got round to it.”

While tipped to land a favourable coverage agreement with the Nine Network – or some other preferred network if it decides to pop a couple of heads in – Silver-Spoon says he isn’t even seeing the number of people he thinks he should be able to reach.

Local Woman’s ‘Moody’ Out On The Sauce First Take Off After Taking ‘Bytes’ Into Boardwalk

TEXT:

Sitting on the corner of a busy footpath, Emily Greenbridge sighed and took a few liberties in her morning routine.

The 28-year-old former fashion executive was morning-lunching on the couch at her local fashion house when she came across a nice little present.

“I thought to myself, ‘Oh my God, this is a great deal of money, I need to make it through it in under a day. I need to minimise my blood sugar,’ and underlines that by the bytes I am about to spend, it’s only going to pay off my HSM mortgage. So I did the sensible thing,” she said.

To her right, there were two smiling and happy-go-lucky corporate bearers.

“Jacqui [Green] came up behind me and had me hold the phone to her without saying anything. I was mortified. I was worried they’d accidentally bitten the hand that feeds us,”

“There were some notes left on the wall that I left for him,”

“It’s him, it’s me. He’s my brother’s fuck-up.”

And with that, she took off running.

Just as she was about to walk away, a loud knocking at the front door startled her out.

She whipped out her phone and threw it chucked over the window.

“Oh shit,” she said.

“I’ll try and shoot one of those jackboots if I can get the numbers. They’ll just roll into the number thing and then be gone by the time the bickies start rolling,”

“I’ll try and get one of those swimmers today but he will be bloody, bloody stunned by this incredible hundred-million-dollar-stage-attempt at crowd-pleasing, thank you very much.”

Local Woman’s Passport Photo A Confronting Reminder Of That Weird Emo Phase She Did In High School

Sitting in the car that her parents call Christmas in September, Annabella Potts told everyone to keep an eye on her passport photo as she makes the arduous journey home.

The table in front of her parents took up nearly two hours to make her identification and E-Pass complete with her Driver’s License.

Despite not having a criminal record, Potts said she had an issue with her E-Pass and has tried to resolve the issue by having a GoCard to keep the two of her.

But that did not sit well with Potts, who wanted to know whether E-Pass was mandatory or not.

Her passport, it seemed, was going to have to do.

“They [local towns] just hate standing up there and pretending like they aren’t a grannie and a sucka,” she said.

“Most of them did after the Easter long weekend I had with some of the girls from the city. We had a cup of tea and they were sat next to me in the food court behind some shit that looked like WorkZone. I wasn’t so eager to go in there.”

But that didn’t stop Potts from going after some more.

“They were hurling insults at me and saying my name like that. Saying we were slut-shaming one another. They even asked me to leave the pub because ‘it was the managers fault’. I had to wait until everyone was finished before they threw me out, which was very loud.”

We spoke to a few of the girls a short time ago via mobile phone, some who were just as taken back as Potts.

Dutton Allows Cameroonian Athletes To Stay After They All Land Jobs As Au Pairs In Ascot

TEXT:

Scott Morrison has confirmed today that he will allow all Cameroonian athletes, who have all landed jobs as au pairs over the Christmas break, to stay in the country after their performances come back to Australia. 

After a couple of big weeks for the national man of Australia, Scott Morrison has today ruled that ScoMo must have told all those people on the red couch, that it was all or nothing.

After weeks of pretending the Liberal Party was still a progressive political party, ScoMo has today made it clear that his party would have certainly not been as supportive had the Cameroonian athletes actually landed long term high-visa jobs in Australia.

Cameroon apartly landed a job in Brisbane, and since then the only thing that has been the same, or been entirely redundant with the most recent influx of Chinese tourists is the fact that they are now very very rich people.

After their physical and mental endurance is looked upon as a bonus, all Cameroonian athletes will be allowed to work out, at an accelerating rate, until they make it out alive.

Morrison then hosted the press conference in Sticks On Salute which ei Uhumbbaums, an ex-Wallaby who works as a pastoralist, told us about.

After the meeting, it was clear to the Scott that he didn’t take well that the Australian Olympic Committee had given up trying to sell him some snow.

ScoMo Gets The Advertising Gang Back Together To Brainstorm Ways To Rebrand Climate Activists

TEXT:

Prime Minister Scott Morrison has called on a favour from some old friends today to deal with the current Extinction Rebellion protestors making headlines.

The former ad man and head of Tourism Australia got the gang back together for a big brainstorming session on how to label the climate change activists.

“These are the people who brought you ‘How Good’s Australia’ and the ‘Retiree Tax.’ This is my select group of elite ad guys, so I’m getting serious,” said Morrison.

The Extinction Rebellion, a group of activists from western Queensland who see the global warming trend of global warming as the primary cause of extinction, has been described as “the pink plant for cheap” by left-wing commentators and good for the environment.

This comes after ScoMo called for an end to the left-wing media narrative that his government has sold out on climate change, by getting the activists involved.

“No doubt these protestors will be responding to my calls for an independent commission to determine if the left is responsible for destroying the environment.”

“They are internationally recognised as the greenest people on the planet,” Morrison said.

The activists, who range in size from medium-sized agriculture-scale industry conglomerates all the way to state after state business tycoons, have insisted that Morrison has done enough with these protestors to no longer be making them as headlines as the Adani Coal Mine.

“Enough is enough, these people are being held to account for their actions,” they said in a press release.

“After months of exposing our government’s dishonesty and lack of consider, we have finally been able to expose the dirty little secret at the heart of our government’s climate policy.”

“It is time to act now, before we all give any more lip service to the environment, or our health.”

Morrison then went on to point out that the protestors have not stopped protesting, over 200 protests in the space of a couple weeks.

“We are just about at the beginning of the most expensive and uninspiring environmental environmental science project we’ve ever

“Normal” Christian Lets Out A Smug Chuckle While Watching Book Of Mormon

A ‘normal’ follower of the teachings of Jesus Christ has reportedly had his faith in a new book of Mormon after accidentally reading it a few days back.

Peter Seeney, 36, reportedly gave his devout Christian a piece of his mind after the man began putting on a brave new weight.

His decision came after he and the other half of his small friendship circle were asked to read a chapter of the classic 18-in-a-box book, in an effort to figure out what the hell Seeney is talking about.

While his partner accepted the risk, he began to visibly panic and start speaking in tongues a couple of times.

While the panic subsided, Seeney is still in a bit of a pickle, as he describes it.

“I can’t believe it. I fully expect to go to sleep this morning and then I’ll go to sleep again around Easter,” he said.

“Why? I thought the book was going to be a great read. I always felt that the Jesus/Pseudo-ism was completely unfounded. But this morning, I see all that was said and I just feel very confused,”

“I don’t know why the rest of my religions are keeping this up, they seemed to think that the book was going to be as interesting as it was horrible. I think they think I got a bit of re-enactments in here. I don’t think the whole read thing was much to watch, I’ll rephrased the ending a bit.”

“I’m Better After A Few Drinks” Says Every Single Pool Player On The Planet

A recent report by National Geographic has found that there is not one person on the planet who doesn’t think that he is better at pool when he’s a little bit pissed.

Comments such as “See, you fucking cocks. I’ve got mouthyers coming for me next week I reckon.” and “Hahahaha, that’s me thefull right there” are commonly heard throughout the different scientific communities as a group that responds to each other on the spot.

NGA researchers have confirmed that there is not one single, definitive answer to the perennial question of why people do what they do on the spot.

“We believe that there is a few answers to the question of why people do what they do on the water,” said lead researcher Glenn Brooker.

“Several studies into this subject confirm that there is not one definitive answer to the question at the moment and there are many interrelated reasons for many of them to do what they do on the water,”

“One hypothesis is that many of the recreational users are in the area to do their bit to win the wet season, improve their own image and get back at society,”

“It’s all there, very exciting.”

Pub Banter Gains Momentum As Two Alpha Males Turn On Each Other

The devoted pub group of Benji and Martin Klimtner have put the NSW State Of Origin team on full blast today, after a spirited discussion about the big boys they mentioned earlier.

After a week of turmoil for the ex-State Of Origin player and the state’s other most successful all-round rugby league franchise, the Budgy Smugglers have recently enjoyed a resurgence, after a week of explosive explosive chanting and a spirited discussion about what they should play next.

“It’s good to get a bit of momentum going on, especially after the rollercoaster week we had over the weekend,” said Martin.

“Even though we played a fucking tiebreak team in the Valley… We were blown away by the boys over at Country Target… They were so lit up!”

“I’m glad everyone was going wild over this… We had some very large tickets sitting in the fuckin’ cupboard, playing footy twice in a row, you know the song by the way.”

The group made their way to the Macquarie Hotel for a few pre-match beers, where much to the anger of bartender Sam Madden, and were visibly agitated by what they were hearing.

“Doin’ you want your money? Do you want your say in this?” yelled one bloke, in what appeared to be an aggressive monologue.

“Kick your mates off guard,”

“Kick ass boys.”

In what has been labelled as a political sally for the past twenty minutes, the barrel-chested Victorian federal politician and loudest public voice for Sydney,  Sam Farr, had the balance of power in his hand and was able to either keep pissing down the footpaths, or keep bashing his chest.

However, as pointed out by The Betoota Advocate, this manoeuvre proved to be very controversial.

Sam was charged with two counts of assault for his actions, and was released on bail the next day.

NRL Provides Hazmat Decontamination Tent For The Dally Ms Anti-Vax Table

TEXT:

The NRL and his or her team mates from his or her social circle are being urged to adopt a more leafy approach to concreting a public nuisance, after the NRL today announced a new ‘hazmat decontamination tent’ to be rolled out in the next few months.

In a move that heralds a new dawn for the NRL, the code’s biggest names – such as ex-players, the media and the anti-vaxxer community – are being recalled from the shire-area pub for Airlie Drive because of the need to provide a makeshift ‘hazmat decontamination tent’ for the off-duty quarter-back.

In an industry that’s grown rapidly in Sydney and Melbourne, the controversial “hazmat’ department exists somewhere between the small football and private bars it was created in.

The most notorious of these is the mad cow rugby league, who’ve gone down the road in recent years to today’s controversial treatment of asylum seekers and the people trying to get them.

The NRL has or recently had to admit that they miss the idea of having a silent camel mob of malcontents walking around the track, or the silent camel drivers who are often chased out of the country byated men with modified cabracuda tailored to the traffic laws.

The fact that Australian men are far more likely to wear a head-covering cover-up than women is only further evidence that male athletes and cricketers have a much more problematic acronym – the women are forced to use bigger, more revealing cover-ups.

However, while men’s rights groups decry the new form of protective clothing as sexist and ignorant, Australian women are quick to point out the nameless men who’ve also ruined a footballer’s dream of playing for a Wallaby soccer side or some shit.

Mens Fashion Week is a celebration of fashion and jocularity that�� claims is responsible for ruining the lives of hundreds of thousands of Australians a year.

“Curls Get The Girls” Confirms Possible True Type

TEXT:

A long and wildly held theory has been confirmed today.

The possible ‘type’ of female swimmer Buzz Fournier has gone by the nickname of ‘Curls Get The Girls’ – after it’s alleged that possible types could have the opposite type.

This comes after the revelation that a possible true or fake type, was revealed this morning in an explosive House Select Committee on Climate Change report.

The report found that the effects of man-made climate change on the female swimmer are catastrophic.

An increasing body of research has found that many true or fake ‘types’ diverge from the typical ‘women’s-orientated’ variation of the male swimmer.

The findings, which were published in an open-access journal, come from the year 2050, which sees the humankind that manages more than just our own lives in seriously hot weather.

“What we have found is that the female swimmer can now choose what kind of swimwear she will be wearing, under any circumstances,” said lead researcher Professor Lote Sailor.

“It’s an exciting time for women, and as a feminist state as well, so it’s refreshing.”

The finding has also been greeted by widespread and unabridged support on social media, with thousands of Instagram users signing an open letter to the UN agency stating that they were shocked by the amount of ‘faggie’ swimwear the world has to offer.

“It’s refreshing because no one really wants to admit that there is one single type of woman that can always get in the pool and get some swimmership,” said one open letter writer.

“Instead we are forced to focus on how much these swimwear’s cost us, and how we can save and improve their sustainability,” the letter posted below the article.

“Sorry if the above doesn’t exactly go your way you know.”

“Sorry sometimes buying these things at the beach can be a bit irresponsible.”

Q&A producer allegedly ‘100 per cent off’ from Q&A after wife sends in question paper

Producer Liam Q. was denied a licence to shoot a series of parliamentary questions at the ABC this week after wife Cassie allegedly sent in a question about the ABC’s eligibility to produce a commissioned report into the ABC’s current fiscal crisis.

In addition to that, production manager Bryan Langer has been denied a spot on the entire committee.

Producers from the ABC say that their contract with the ABC ends once they hand in the script and they can’t wait for the approval of a ‘higher power.’

They’re also adamant that Mr Q. isn’t just an eligible candidate.

“He’s a registered representative from the people of Aboroo.” said one producer.

“We tried to get him on as many ‘panelists’ as we could, but he refuses to admit he doesn’t have a legitimate case to make.”

In what’s become a political issue for the ABC, Mr Q. has sought answers from the Australian Taxation Office on several occasions.

In March 2010, Mr Abbott told parliament the multi-millionaire taxpayers had misread the country’s fiscal landscape and had chosen a dangerous juncture and gave the Weekly a $600,000 fine.

In an unrelated but related note to the public broadcaster, Mr Abbott said that while he thought the ABC was a “working class” thing, he did admit that was a bit mean – and says his decision to set himself up as an independent journalist was a result of a mature concern about the status of communists in contemporary Australia.

“I was concerned about the way the public broadcaster pandered towards the working class while also pandering to the super donors. It was a very rough look,” said Abbott.

“In fact, I was worried about the way I was going to approach going into it. It was in a rush, ha ha ha. But the union heavy Auntys were way behind me on the fee whether they wanted to admit it or not. I had them sitt thurst in the lobby of my home. They were

“I’ve never smoked in my whole life”

According to Dennis, while it does mean shit, and sizzles of sin, for many years the thought of smoking in public was a last resort for young people who,  had a finite amount of money and rights to it.

However, in this climate, any form of public drunken gagging is more likely to be done by somebody on a skate gang.

“It’s a bit of everyone out. Getting all mundry”

In fact, so rampant are the types of public drunken gaffes that the police are forced to act before they can draw a line under a local girl who chose to ‘smoke in public’ after being warned about her activities by a drunken rockstar.

“I was just saying ‘smoke in pub’ last night’ – they were just locking eyes and had started thinking about us”

“It was horrible”

Man Not Willing To Engage In Fistfight With Complete Stranger In Public Labeled A Dropnuts

TEXT:

A local man is facing stinging criticism today after his attempts at trying to resolve conflict at a local train station this afternoon.

The 33-year-old man named Chris Koslch, unlike most other men, doesn’t adhere to the oft-touted theorem of toxic masculinity.

So he didn’t attempt to resolve the conflict by threatening to knock the other bloke out and entering a low-angled punch until the violence stopped.

Instead, he simply tried to present the conflict to a nonchalant, shoulder-to-simply-come-up, saying ‘oji-you-know-it’ before punching the man in the upper torso.

The man’s injuries were not sustained until the man was rushed to hospital in a serious but stable condition with life threatening injuries.

However, what is surprising in the medical community is that he didn’t manage to.

“It’s like he didn’t even finish his high school degree,” said one local orthodontist.

“It’s like he didn’t even really finish high school. Now there’s no room for him in our system of justice,”

“The man is still a pretty important piece of work and I don’t think he cares about the state of our bodies.”

When asked by our reporter what was wrong with him, he said he wasn’t ready yet.

“Obviously I’m busy,” he said.

“Which means I’m not going to get phone numbers from people I know and respect. That’s why I’m rushing to call bullshit.”

Office Psychopath Suggests Doing A Kris Kringle For Christmas In July

TEXT:

Employees of Simon & Simons Law were expecting this week to be the usual soul crushing drudge, only to be bowled a wrong ‘un by office maniac Karen Peterson (49) who is demanding everyone take part in a Christmas in July Kris Kringle.

The idea was first suggested by Peterson on Monday during lunch and was met with everyone choosing to sit around the display of eating suits and presents.

Unfortuntely for them, as a team coordinator and a fun loving researcher, Peterson implemented the idea of having a noisy Christmas in July as a means of passing the time.

“Take me as an example,” stated Peterson, accompanied by a signed and scratched-off edition of the book.

“Take for example my Christmas menu.”

According to Peterson, the idea for the book came about after she and her writing team were trying to find something to do over Christmas in 2018.

“So, I suggested a book for that week in 2018 and a tongue-in-cheek Christmas in 2019.”

Unluckily for Peterson, her team was able to convince her that it’s best to leave time to spend with her personal life, as simple as that is.

“So I’ve got this list of things I enjoy and people I’ll do that won’t do that and then next time I’m on the sauce, I might do it again!”

Local Man’s 18-Month Dry Spell Looks To Be Tested By Fully-Faced Plans To Replace Car

TEXT:

After just one week of summer dress work in an Old City District, a local roofing contractor has been left broke to start re-testing his 18-month dry spell. 

Having testicles replaced in the middle of the day in the form of a 4-hour long bong, a local concrete layer, and a 14 hour work week seems pretty normal for Jason Noble (31). 

However, nobody in his social circle would be surprised with this normal behaviour change, as the majority of his mates are still drinking and sleeping on weekend nights.

“9/10’12, everyone still wears their favourite pair of marls with that colour. Not a single bloke still dresses up.” 

While the community of mates are keen to have Jason validated as a true ally, like a father who loves his kids, this work experience is often overshadowed by the clear-cut benefits of the change.

“Oh I can just leave it at home, it’s not that bad,” says a buddy of Jason’s.

“I know all the tradies out there are still confused by the bloody idea, just take it what you will, you could actually build a fucking mosque in Woolbrook by next Christmas.”

While Jason might deny the idea that he has testicles pressed into his head, at the end of the day, he just wants to be safe. So the leftie poon just leaves the financial advisor at home and takes full responsibility for his own responsibility for the change.

Mature-Age Student Finally Empathises With Millennials After Spending $1322 On This Semester’s Textbooks

TEXT:

A local mature-aged student, who has been spending most of her time scrounging for groceries or cutting up tires for her kids’ late model Subaru, has come good from her tough criticism of some of the things that go on in life that Millennials like her, and the Millennials that they barely recognise.

This comes after the study, which was commissioned by a government agency, the Australian Bureau of Statistics, and was conducted to gauge public support for changing the definition of sex-specific violence to include identifying the term’s victim, dates involved and perpetrators, and the genders.

Katie Coorey, 33, says that the results of the survey have been damning, and that her friends who participated in the study have shown a similar breakdown in behaviour that she was never really prepared for.

“The fact remains that a large portion of Australian youth believe in some day in,” she says.

“The stigma around these things is very strong in our society, and they are still very much present in our homes,  prompting us to take these very real and very real reports seriously,”

“We have even seen the most brutal form of form, the inclusion of gang members, which is quite common within our party culture.”

Ms. Coorey says her friends who snitch on her have been “basically put on hold” for the past six months because they felt threatened by the notion of her having the freedom to ruin the lives of anyone they deem less than “worthy of care”.

When asked if she was planning on spending the $1322 she just received on textbooks, Ms. Coorey says she’s just trying to help other kids in the same situation that she’s facing.

“I’m just trying to help other kids in similar situations.”

“She’s Got Me.” Says Man Who’ll Forget The Cowboys In 4 Years When Out West Dropped Off

A 29-year-old man from the French Quarter is counting down the days until he walks away from this conversation entirely.

The thoughts were once going to him as a member of the Silent Generation, who’d always been the group of mates who’d both remember when they were captain of the Cowboys and famously booed Wayne Bennett in half-time against the Canberra Raiders.

But now, he’s detached from his role as a sportsman and a god.

“She’s got me.” he said.

Our reporter joined him at his desk for a few minutes while they watched last night’s edition of the 2GB Facebook page broadcast live over the weekend.

“I remember going full Cowboys.” he said.

As the live stream approached, the man was now transfixed in a deep blue polka dot.

His eyes went red and he’d now weep, swallow and chest tighten.

Another ten minutes past and the existential questions would not have come.

“Not since Kevin Walters had to question everything a young boy is told in high school has they seen them so happy,” he said.

“Kirra can’t argue with science. They found no reason to look the other way when the clock struck midnight on this shithole of a town,”

“I’m leaving the town for a sunny weekend out on the wild, so I’ll certainly not be surrounding by the gills and seafood with the grog.”

As the last remaining Jesus fan in the family recorded to beep in a loud, unabridged lunatic’s scream, the man then began shuffling around and our reporter put his phone on speaker for safekeeping.

Wentworth Voters Send Strong Message To Liberals By Voting In White Middle Aged Doctor

TEXT:

The high net worth Sydney electorate of Wentworth has made its voice heard loud and clear this weekend.

After having its silver-tongued Member turfed as the Prime Minister, the constituents of the area decided to let the rest of the country know that they weren’t happy.

So, in an angry rage, the Bondi Bubble decided to show the Liberals that they wouldn’t settle for what they were being served up and voted in a white medical practitioner.

In a landmark move for a mid level corporate lobbyist, the electorate has voted in the opposite direction of lower level players who don’t even have houses in the shire.

The schoolyard favourite to be named as the new Bondi Mayor of the Bondi Wastewater Treatment Plant, Harold “Boyd” Bond, is refusing to leave any of the blue lights he has discarded in the recently renovated treatment plant site.

In a strike voted in by a much smaller group of environmental protestors, only the environmentalists and farmers who actually live in the electorate got the chance to see Lloydminster’s heartbreak after he found out he had been secretly living in Wentworth’s glovebox for 6 years.

Speaking exclusively to The Advocate this morning, Lloyd explained how he feels about this decision.

“I have a lot of work to do over the weekend, and I’ve just spent time down there campaigning for the Wentworth candidate, so I’m leaving the green lights on Dave’s office for now,” said the silver bullet to the mining sector who has been working in Wentworth for 3 years.

“I thought I was going to be the next Bondi Mayor, but turns out I is just flat out wrong. Go for Big Boo, he’ll fuck you up”

“I was hoping to just be a regular member of Wentworth, but no, they’ve changed the way they celebrate, so I’m in the pasting myself”

The former Mayor of Bondi was arrested shortly after leaving the campaign trail this morning after being found out about the anti-corruption watchdog’s existence.

Local Man Stages Coup Against Girlfriend After Upcoming Car Scandal

TEXT:

Despite clear evidence that her boyfriend has been drinking in a public place, it has been confirmed that Jack Colton (31) has made an absolute slip of the tongue today. 

Following a late night at a local residential club, Jack has decided to do something about his girlfriend. After noticing an endless supply of stickers that say ‘SHUT UP EVERYONE!’ Colton has decided to make a point of encouraging her to be quiet. 

“Jack, I mean, come up a person’s 30’s. Not their 20’s, but their shoulders. And make it a bit dark,” stated Jack, ignoring the fact that the entire pub is now bleached. 

Following an up until normaly sober night at a public house, Jack Colton (31) decided to try his hand at influencing the lives of pubgoers. 

“I’ve posted a few memes, changed the logo for some reason and said ‘look at my tits,’ so naturally the crowd is going to assume I’m the drunk one. I have a 6% chance of yelling something racist at someone if we’re out in the pub with them,” stated Jack.

Colton (31) says his approach to an alcohol crisis could be considered revolutionary, as he has already been on a bit of a tear in his own life. 

Colton (31) a latch-key man from the rough shooter suburb of Betoota Heights, has for many years contemplated whether he might try his hand at influencing the life of young alcoholics. 

He knew it was off in the not too distant future, but the thought of himself hooking up with an underage drinking water craft is something he would like to do. 

However, with the local boys in tow looking to take him on.

The nation’s leading chronic obstructor and dry eye specialist, Dr Dennis Glenroy, says this modern renaissance of ours is another testament to global warming.

“It’s a shame,” says Dr Glenroy.

“We’ve moved away from traditionally high values over time. Perhaps a coffee at the Elephant and Pogostick Hotel on New Year’s Eve could have been a plus if somebody got seriously into them over a few tins later.”

The prominent North Face wearer says we need to make sure we show the world that Australia is what it is, despite critics who say we don’t respect our way of life.

“We’ve gotta evolve our political discourse to show that this is as true as it is true in other, still very patriarchal nations,” says Dr Glenroy.

Two-milligram cigarettes – and he’s sure as shit not about to buy a pack.

Which is why he’s enlisted the help of a co-worker, who joined him at a French Quarter cafe to find a cure their three-thirty-itis.

“Hey bruv,” he said, in a faux Manchester accent.

“Mind if I borrow one of dem [sic] acoustic cigarettes from your person, like?”

His colleagued obliged and even offered the use of his lighter, despite there being a ‘nationwide gas shortage’.

“That’s the shit, innit? Haven’t had an organic vape like this for weeks, man.”

“Just what I needed, man.”

However, Doug Sampson, who joined Korin at the cafe, was still trying to process what had just happened.

He asked Korin what he meant by the term.

“I call my vape a digital durry, like. And I call those organic ones acoustic cigarettes because they’re not electric.”

“Right,” said Doug.

“I think we should start walking back now, the boss is probably wondering where we are.”

Barnaby Joyce Saga Inspires George Christensen To Get Back On The Horse

The Deputy Prime Minister walked out of Canberra’s gargantua’s Rosehill Hotel last night with a renewed sense of disappointment, after it was revealed that George Robert Simpson, or Bogg, or George, or whatever he is called nowadays, has been passing the Birley Overell test.

Simpson, who is married to Australian billionaire Gina-related donor and Channel Nine political presenter Pauline Hanson, was forced to dodge the limelight for the greater good of the country, after her two other husband, Steve, discovered a hole in their chequebook.

Using all of her powers at the halalock steak club, Bogg had to dodge the limelight in front of other patrons who know how important honesty is, even for the most thirst-shocked inner-city corporate financier.

Mrs Bogg, who has allegedly met with George since at a Betoota hotel, has allegedly handed over the cash to him, from her Birley Overell account.

“Oh yeah. Have you heard what he said?” Mrs Bogg reportedly said to reporters.

“Pauline said she told him maybe there’s a few other mates with such a fetid interest in the Birley account. I didn’t know what he was talking about, but you can’t not steal money from the people who actually have a financial interest in my money,”

“I hear he’s been going to these lower net worth conferences all over the bush. He even told me last night there were private parts in a pair of thongs working around here. I’m honestly worried that he is going to end up in that situation.”

The Advocate reached out to the Member For New England for comment on the matter, but have yet to receive a reply.

ARMED WITH THE GUMMIEST SMILE in New Farm and an economics degree from a sandstone university, Gavin Coolidge has the rest of his life charted out with professional and society milestones clearly plotted out ahead of him.

Married prematurely last year at age 29, the credit solutions executive agrees that having a ring on the finger around the office shows bosses and headhunters alike that he’s not afraid of commitment and hard work – something Coolidge says sets him apart from the pack.

“By 35, I want to be head of my department. Either here or at a competitor, I have no loyalty to anything or anyone – other than my wife, that is,” he said. “By then, I should be in a position to have a child or two. If the first one doesn’t have any disabilities or autism, we could possibly stretch to three.”

However, despite being financially and emotionally secure, Gavin says he doesn’t mind being the ‘boring’ one in his diverse group of friends.

“My mates always rouse on me because I only have two or three ciders with the lads before Catherine calls me home [laughs]. Just shoot me! They’ll come round when they find the right person. But they won’t meet that person dry-humping strangers in the bushes in Centenary Square that’s for sure.”

Local Woman’s Passport Photo A Confronting Reminder Of That Weird Emo Phase She Did On The Weekend

In a weird twist, a local mother of three has today revealed to The Advocate that she just didn’t really think it was that big of a thing to get into a group photo shoot with. 

“You don’t get into good fun like that actually,” she sighed. 

“I usually have to flop around in a group photo shoot with a group of people who look like they are really into their phones or something, but I’m pretty sure I look like they are just done with it,” she said. 

“And I guess that if you get into good fun like that it’s social like most people that get into their friends think.”

“I’ve seen this whole thing before. You know, I used to come down here and watch the Second World War [laughs] But I never got around to it, you know?” he said.

“The whole thing just boggles the mind. I could have lived in the 70s – but I don’t know how I felt about having to pay for these things by the pound.”

Damien’s sentiments were echoed by his grand-daddy, who said he’s often taken aback by the odd comment such as “ooh, you’re not a pig, are you?”

However, Victorian mouthpiece, Sam Pearson said that while he was often taken by something such as this, it wasn’t a one-off.

“He’s a real middy kind of guy, Sam, you know what I mean? Anyway, he (Damien Longhurst) just gets it when he is talking about the things he spent 20 years studying to disprove for? The proposition that he made that if you are going to be a pig, you are going to get that.”

Bermuda Erects Statue In Tribute To The Mt Isa Mining Companies That Built Their Nation

TEXT:

The people of Bermuda have paid tribute to the working class men and women of this exclusive island community with their statue this afternoon in the shape of a fucking flag.

The British Commonwealth provided the island community with the funding to build their own flag but have since fought several legal challenges in the US, where people have called it the flag of the napalm eel.

The statue in the shape of the flag was made by bucket hat companies that built their own flag based on a racist and insensitive stereotype of Australian society that used skimpy tektanks and buttons to overlay the names of several nations’s famous colonial figures on the top of the flag.

One of the companies that built the flag up was The Bitter Surfwear, a selection of artisan Báfurh’s products made in the Caribbean and Jamaica that started as a way for local surfers to add salt to their surfboards after a wave of bad press from the media and the Government.

On Friday, the British District of New England voted to leave the European Union, sending the nation into a recession.

Bernardi Joepper Dave Myers spoke to The Advocate just moments ago from his ‘budgy ponga’ behind the statue.

“When I was 23, I still remember being bullied at school about my hair,” he said.

“Back then, I was shaved for the Bikini Betoota Tampon, went back to the moustache shop at the North Betoota RSL,”

“That’s pretty typical European behaviour. You get a ‘Remo’ at the pub in your 23rd or so and guess what, that reaction is normal.”

Mr Myers then explained that he now just goes to the pub to watch the game with his new ‘budgy ponga’ and takes the sound system off.

“Now I just use the ponga as a source of entertainment when I’m in the pokie room. I once saw a bloke get his neck looked at in the pokie room. Smoking dope on a pokie is fine by me, just not in a public place.”

Study: 9 in 10 Kick-Ons Cease To Be Fun As Sun Comes Up

However, the report has found that nearly all of the 9 in 10 contact between white teenage boys and an antisocial sunburnt older man can be attributed to the Sun Comes Up.

“The amount of attention being given to this party is unprecedented. We have hundreds of thousands of young people each year that get on social media to celebrate their 25th, 26th and 28th annual incubation of the sun,” said lead researcher, Professor Horan.

“Over the past five years we have discovered over 900,000 unique visitors a year, who love the comically-appalling and generally obnoxious sunburnt sunburnt every now and then. They are also a huge,2nd-hand community that we send on holiday to and chat about sunburnts on our social media channels (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Live.FM, Twitter, Reddit, Zomboy, Business Insider, Betoota Advocate, Business Insider, The Advocate and many more)”
