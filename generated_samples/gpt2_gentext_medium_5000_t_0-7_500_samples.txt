Cabinet Files: Rudd Calls For A National Ban On Cabbies Cabbies

TEXT:

The Leader of the Opposition has today announced a national ban on all forms of cabbies, including those that operate in the taxi industry.

This follows revelations that the entire Caboolture Caboolture Cabbie Association was set up in an illegal, kick-on-in-place scheme, and that the entire industry of cabbies is now in jeopardy of losing their licence.

While the leader of the opposition was able to avoid a media scrum today, as he was able to catch a taxi at the appointed time – the real issue that the Opposition have is that they are letting the industry down, and the voters, in the most obvious and blatant of positions.

“It’s time to ban all cabbies” said Rudd.

“These taxi drivers are helping the 1% make up for the 2%”

“The people who make up the 2% in this country are the most vulnerable to the corruption and greed of the 1%”

The Leader of the Opposition has today called for a national ban on cabbies, citing a recent report by the Australian Tax Office that found that over 95% of all tax-payer funded taxis in Australia are used solely for commercial purposes.

“Cabbies are a tax-payer funded industry. It’s time to make sure that industry is not profiting from the people’s trust. It’s time to make sure the people who ride these things are the people who deserve to pay tax, not the 1% who are ripping people off,”

Rudd says the current level of cabbies in Australia is “too much for our liking” and says that he would like to see a national ban on cabbies.

Brisbane Intern Could’ve Just Replaced Old Intern With Her Cousin, Says 15 Minutes After Work

TEXT:

A young professional has today offered her briefcase to her boss in a last minute, following an unfortunate incident on Thursday morning.

The young woman, Sarah, says she’s just noticed that everyone is getting a little restless, and as a result, she’s decided to make a dash for the front door.

It’s just after 5 in the morning on the outskirts of our cosmopolitan desert community, and Sarah is already late getting out of the office.

“I just don’t get it, why are people late?” she asks her boss, who is currently working the phones.

“I can see why they are late, but I don’t understand why it’s so hard to get people to come and work on Thursday”

“I don’t know, I’m really getting late, I should’ve just replaced the intern with my cousin”

“It’s like they’re just waiting for someone to die.”

While the office has taken this opportunity to make sure that no one will be late, Sarah says she’s not willing to take any responsibility, and that the only person that can make her late is herself.

“I’m just a young professional, and I can’t make it to work with the 10pm shift”

“Maybe I’ll just get a job at a hotel or something.”

“I’ve got a Bachelor in Paradise coming up.”

Labor Gains Control Of NSW Senate After Unanimous Vote To End Party

TEXT:

After a number of attempts at changing the party’s name, the Australian Labor Party has managed to gain control of the New South Wales Senate, following an historic vote, which will mean the end of the party.

After a heated debate, the ALP was able to gain control of the upper house, as well as the lower house, after a number of high-profile names, including former treasurer Scott Morrison, and outgoing NSW premier Gladys Berijikilan were absent.

As a result, the ALP is now set to be in a much stronger position in the upper house, where they will have a much better chance at regaining power in the next election, if they can win over Gladys’ support.

In a statement released by the ALP this morning, they said they’re not concerned about the fact that they’ll lose the next election, and that the ALP is in control of the upper house.

“We’ve lost a few seats in this state, but we’re in a better position to win the next election,” said the ALP leader.

“So we’re in control of the upper house,”

“So we’re in control of the upper house. So we’ve won control of the New South Wales senate. So we’re in control of the NSW upper house. So in a few months we’ll be in control of the NSW state government. So in a few months, we’ll be in control of the NSW upper house.”

The ALP’s statement comes after a number of party insiders have told The Advocate that they’ve been trying to change the name of the party for months, and that they’ll be back in control of the party after the election.

“I can’t believe how bad it is for us,” said one insider.

“We need to be more in touch with the people. We need to win more seats in NSW and WA, and I’m not sure how you do that without alienating people who don’t like you,”

“I mean, if you don’t like me, you should vote Liberal. It’s not like I’m going to win an election with my own personal views and opinions,”

“And we’re going to win more seats in NSW than Labor. That’s our goal.”

Strawberry Mango Salad With Avocado Dressing A Dish Best To Use As A Humidor

A new study released by the CSIRO has found that if served cold, strawberries mango salad with avocado dressing a dish is the best way to enjoy a cold bottle of vodka.

The study found that serving the salad hot is the best way to consume a bottle of rum, while serving it cold is the worst way to consume a bottle of vodka.

The CSIRO released their findings into the public domain after a number of journalists contacted them with their own stories.

“This is just one of those things,” said one CSIRO researcher.

“The same goes for the avocado dressing. You can serve it cold or you can serve it hot. Serving it hot is not good. Serving it cold is not healthy. But serving it hot is great.”

Gladys Has Labor Been As Clear As Possible On The Fact That They Have To Be In Order To Win This Election

TEXT:

The nation’s election campaign has been divided into two camps this afternoon as the two major parties vie for the last of two major parties, in a desperate attempt to win the next election.

While the Coalition has had to spend a great deal of money and energy trying to win over voters in marginal seats, the opposition has been forced to spend a great deal of money and energy trying to win over voters in marginal seats that they have already won by the largest margin.

While both major parties have tried to paint their policies as being in line with the Australian people, it appears that the Australian people don’t really care about the details that the Coalition and Labor have spent so much time and energy campaigning over.

The major parties have spent so much time and energy campaigning over the last few years about things that they are almost devoid of any policy that is actually relevant to the everyday Australian, and yet they are both spending millions on advertising and media appearances trying to win over the people that voted for them.

It is not yet known whether the Australian people are actually interested in the details that the Coalition and Labor have spent so much time and energy campaigning over, or if they are just trying to get elected because they are the only viable option.

However, the fact that both major parties are spending millions on advertising and media appearances just trying to win over voters that have already voted for them, as well as the fact that they are both missing the ball – all of these things are enough to make the Australian public think that the major parties are being disingenuous and out of touch.

The Daily Telegraph To Begin Scratching Desks For The New Year

TEXT:

The nation’s most venerated newspaper, The Telegraph, has today announced plans to begin scratching their desks for the new year.

The move comes after the paper’s board met to discuss the state of the paper and the state of the newsroom.

In a move that some say is ‘unorthodox’ and ‘odd’, the paper has announced plans to scratch their desks for the new year.

The announcement follows a recent study conducted by the Newspaper and Newspaper Owners Council (SNOC) which has found that the paper’s editorial standards and content are not as high as those of other major newspapers in the country.

The paper’s newsroom have been hit by a steady decline in productivity, which has resulted in a sharp decline in quality.

One source close to the situation explained that ‘Scratching is a sign of a broken newsroom’.

“It’s a sign that the people responsible for producing news for the paper are no longer in control of the story,” they said.

“The paper has had a general election campaign covered in this year’s national campaign, and it’s not hard to see why they’d want to scratch their desks for the new year,”

“But, yeah. It’s a sign that something needs to be done. Something needs to be done about the paper being run by people who have a vested interest in keeping the paper as reliable as possible, and that’s what I’m going to do.”

The Advocate reached out to The Telegraph’s CEO, Murdoch ­Lambeau, for comment but he said he’d just been on a holiday.

Local Dad Tries His Best To Not Be The Dad Who’s Watching The Show

The presenters of the ABC’s Q&A program, Tony Jones and Andrew Bolt, have today managed to avoid being completely out of line.

The two guests on the program have had a few rants about Australian politics and the Australian media landscape today, and it seems as though neither man can believe that they’ve managed to get a whole panel of other people to agree with them on a few key points.

Andrew Bolt, a well-known former political rival to Tony Jones’ current political rival, says he’s been trying his best to not get his own political party to agree with him on some points, while Tony Jones says he’s been trying his best to not get his own party to agree with him on others.

It appears as though the only way these two old school men can disagree on a few things is by talking about the same things and using the same words.

It is not yet known if these two old boys have a falling out, or if they’ve just been playing chicken until they are a couple of points out of the gate, but they both look as though they have it in the bag, so it is not hard to see why they are on the show.

Bloke Who Now Lives In Sydney Has No Idea What It Was Like To Be A Young Liberal

TEXT:

A local young Liberal who spent a decade at the helm of the NSW Liberal Party, has today had to admit that he was never a Liberal, ever.

It was always the opposite.

“Yeah, I guess I am a young liberal,” said Dale John (30), a self-described young liberal.

“Like, I’m a young liberal because I’m in the middle of a period of transition.”

“I think my political identity is emerging from the New South Wales Liberal Party,”

“I guess I’ve never really been a member of the Liberal Party, it’s just a natural evolution of my politics.”

Dale says he’s had a number of conversations with the party’s youth wing, where he’s met with a lot of young people who are now leaving the party.

“I’ve met a lot of young people who are leaving, like, for the NSW Liberal Party,”

“Like, I met a young woman who’s just joined the Liberal Party, she’s a member now. She’s a private school girl. She’s not a young liberal, she’s a public school girl.”

The NSW Liberal Party’s youth wing is set to meet this week to discuss the issue.

The NSW Liberal Party’s director-general, David Shearer, is the first person to say the party is a ‘big old boy’.

“We are a big old boy’s club,” he said.

“Young people are attracted to the NSW Liberal Party because we are one of the last political parties that represents young people. We’re also one of the last parties that represents working-class and lower-middle class people,”

“That’s why you’ll see a lot of these young people gravitating towards the NSW Liberal Party. I’m not saying it’s the only reason, I just saying that they’re attracted to the NSW Liberal Party because it’s one of the last political parties that represents them.”

New Study Confirms Australia Is A Nation That Always Loves Us

TEXT:

A new study released by the CSIRO this morning has confirmed that our nation is, and always has been, a nation that loves us.

The report was released to coincide with the release of the new Australian census data this morning which showed the number of Australian residents claiming to be one of the nation’s ‘most‑favourite’ people has increased by 1.6 per cent since the census was first published in 1993.

The CSIRO report, which was commissioned by the Australian Chamber of Commerce, Tourism, Industry and the Arts (ACCITA) says that the country’s ‘favourite’ people are now a much bigger percentage of the total population.

“What we have found is that the number of Australians who are most likely to be ‘favourite’ people has increased significantly,” said one lead researcher, Professor Mal Tuquiri.

“People who are most likely to be ‘favourite’ people, according to the new census data, has increased dramatically over the last 20 years,”

“It’s a very interesting trend, and one that we would suggest is worth exploring further in the future.”

“In particular, the number of people who claim to be most ‘Australian’.”

“We have found that over the last two decades, the number of Australians claiming to be most ‘Australian’ has gone through the roof,”

“That’s according to the new census data, which shows that the number of people who most often claim to be most ‘Australian’ has gone up by 1.6 per cent.”

Herald Sun: We Don’t Need Global Warming To Make Australia Great Again

TEXT:

The nation’s peak scientific body has confirmed this morning that we don’t need climate change to make Australia great again.

The Heads of the CSIRO, a group of over 100 scientists, released a statement this morning outlining the government’s position on climate change.

“If you are a hardworking man, and you care about the environment and climate change, then you are a hardworking man,” they said.

“But if you are a woman, and you don’t believe climate change is happening, then you are a woman who believes in global warming,”

“If you are a Liberal, and you believe in climate change, then you are a Liberal who believes in global warming, but if you are a conservative, you are a conservative who believes in climate change,”

“If you are a Democrat and you think global warming is a myth, then you are a Democrat who thinks global warming is a myth,”

“If you are a Liberal, but believe in climate change and want action on climate change, then you are a Liberal who believes in global warming, but if you are a conservative, you are a conservative who believes in climate change, but if you are a Liberal who believes in climate change and want action on climate change, then you are a Liberal who believes in climate change,” the CSIRO said.

The statement came after the CSIRO released their first-ever forecast for the nation’s economy in the next few years.

That statement has sent shockwaves through the nation’s financial markets, with some saying that the CSIRO’s projections for the economy could be a bit off.

The Advocate spoke to a number of climate change sceptic investors, who have been left scratching their heads this morning.

One such investor, who asked to remain anonymous, said the CSIRO’s projections are a bit out of touch with today’s climate.

“What’s the deal with global warming?” they said.

“Why doesn’t anyone care about the environment and climate change? Why isn’t anyone talking about the fact that we will all die by the time this century is over?”

“I’m not a scientist, I’m a simple man with a simple mind,” they said.

“But I do understand that there is a global warming crisis and that it’s happening. I also understand that if you disagree with this, you are a ‘leftie’ and should be ignored,”

“But I don’t agree with the CSIRO’s climate change projections, so I’m out.”

“The new Charity will be a non-profit organisation, not a tax-payer organisation”

“The Board of Directors will consist of one representative from each political faction, representing each faction in a representative capacity”

“This will ensure that the Board will have an accurate understanding of the issues faced by Australians each year, while also offering them a level of personal accountability that comes at no cost to the organisation”

“The new Charity will be run in a transparent and accountable manner, with the ultimate goal of making the world a better place.”

“The Board will be made up of representatives from each faction, and will be able to appoint a number of people to board who will be appointed by the faction”

“The Board of Directors will have the final say on who gets on the board”

“The new Charity will be run under a strict set of guidelines, with the ultimate goal of making the organisation as transparent as possible”

“All board members will be required to provide a detailed account of their activities”

“This will be a great way for the public to see what kind of person is on the board of a charity that they’re not too familiar with, and who they’re more familiar with”

“A Very Narrow Band-Aid Solution To A Very Serious Problem” Says Abbott

TEXT:

Tony Abbott has today announced a new approach to combat the scourge of alcohol and other drug use.

“Rather than patch up the existing alcohol-related hospital admissions and legal bans, I’m proposing a very narrow band-aid solution that will make the problem go away”

The former Prime Minister has spent the last fortnight in the headlines for his extremely public comments about the ‘climate change debate’ and the fact that he thinks gay people are more likely to use drugs.

Abbott says his solution to the scourge of alcohol and other drugs is to make sure alcohol is made available in limited amounts in licensed premises, in a very tight supply.

“The solution is simple. We need to make sure the alcohol is made available in a very, very narrow band-aid solution”

“For example, the only way you’d get a really big hit on the night is if you’re at home with a big heavy at the pub. That’s the only way to make sure the alcohol is made available.”

“If you’re not at home with a big heavy, make sure you’re at home with a bloke who’s never had a beer, make sure you’re at home with a bloke who’s never been to a pub, make sure you’re at home with a guy who’s never had sex with a woman, and make sure you’re at home with a bloke who’s never had sex with anyone”

“We’ll make sure the alcohol is available at a very limited amount until the problem is solved, then we’ll make sure the alcohol is made available at a much lower level and so on,”

“The problem isn’t that alcohol is dangerous, it’s that you can get a very, very large hit on a very, very tight night, and so on.”

“I Don’t Care If You Can’t Read, You Can’t Read” Says One-Night-Stand

TEXT:

“I don’t care if you can’t read, you can’t read” said a group of local partygoers tonight, as the night watchman struggled to read a book he’s only read once before.

Just prior to his midnight break, which is typically his nightwatchman hour, Peter Arney, decided to catch up with some old friends at a local pub.

It was the first time the group had all been together, but the night was young so the mood was loose.

“It was a good night, aye” he said, while the old friends enjoyed the rest of the evening playing a game of pool.

“They were all playing so fast and furious, it was like they were playing a game of paintball. I think they were playing for the adrenaline of it. I don’t know, it was so fun,”

Opposition Leader Bill Shorten Accused Of Being A ‘Puppet’ For One Nation

TEXT:

After a string of scandals this year, the Opposition has had to choose a new leader for the Australian Greens Party, after the resignation of their last two stalwarts.

The new leader of the Australian Greens Party, Richard Di Natale, has been accused of being a puppet for One Nation, after it was revealed that he is a close friend of the party.

“I was the first to admit that One Nation is a puppet party,” said Di Natale.

“But I was the first to take action to fix it.”

The Opposition leader Bill Shorten was said to be considering the resignation of his two deputy leaders, and the elevation of a third, who was not named.

“I’ve got a great team and I think I’m going to win this election,” said the leader of the Opposition.

“But, you know, I’ve got to make sure I don’t get a whole bunch of old hands who’s not that old to begin with,” he said.

“Plus, I’ve got to make sure I don’t get a bunch of new hands who’s not that young to begin with,” he said.

Local Dad’s New Fucking Seinfeld Comic Is Full Of Homosexual Plot Holes

TEXT:

“Ooo,” he said.

“That’s a great idea. I’ll read it.”

Betoota’s new father, Wally, said he loved the comic and thought it was a great way to introduce his children to the wonderful world of comics.

However, the 48-year-old former soldier is concerned about the content of the comic and its overall tone.

He spoke to The Advocate this morning after he read the first issue of the new comic.

“I thought to myself, Jesus Christ, how am I supposed to indoctrinate my kids into thinking that this is what real life looks like? That’s the question I had in mind when I drew it,” he said.

“But then I remembered that this comic has a gay subplot, which really threw me when I first read it. I mean, Jesus Christ, what is gay?”

“So I started reading it and it just blew me away. I thought, ‘Jesus Christ, what’s that? It’s got a gay subplot, too. Why does this comic need to be gay? It’s not like it’s anti-gay, it’s just that there are a lot of straight people who like gay things,’ and I was like, ‘well, that’s just what’s gay,’ and then I’m reading the next issue and it’s just full of homo-erotic plot holes.”

“I don’t get it.”

Our reporter reached out to the creators of the comic and they were able to give a statement in response.

“The gay subplot in this comic is completely unnecessary and contrived. It is not even hinted at. It is simply the gay side of a gay man, which is the same sex, to be exact. The gay side of a straight man is not a gay side.”

“There are no gay subplots in this comic, just straight people who are gay.”

Closer Look At The Sun-dried Tomato Soup Cooking Pot Suggests You Don’t Need A Sunburnt Lung

As the Australian summer solstice draws closer, the amount of sun on the ground has decreased dramatically.

That’s according to a recent study by the CSIRO, who have concluded that the amount of daylight lost to the sky has decreased dramatically, since the rise of the sun as a solar-exhaustive greenhouse gas.

However, that’s not the case for the ground in the northern hemisphere, where the amount of daylight has increased dramatically.

This has led researchers to hypothesise that the rise of the sun as a solar-exhaustive greenhouse gas has had a detrimental effect on the earth’s climate.

Local Dad Questions Whether His Daughter Is At Home With His Mate’s Son

Local father, John, has made it clear that his wife of 25 years, Marianne, is not at home with his son, who is a young man with very visible mental and emotional problems.

While his wife, Susan, is a single mother of four, he says that his daughter, Sarah, is not at home with their son, Josh, who is a good kid but probably wouldn’t be the best fit for a boy’s life.

“Sarah’s not at home with my son, Josh, I’m afraid,” he said.

“Josh is a pretty good kid, but he’s not my daughter. He’s not like my daughter, he’s not a bad kid,”

“I’ve got to get Marianne to calm down a bit, I’m afraid. Josh is a really good kid, but I know he’s getting into trouble at home. I’m not sure what it is, maybe he’s just lonely,”

“Sarah says he’s lonely at home with his mother. I don’t know how she knows that. He says he’s lonely at home with his father. Josh’s mother is a good person and everything else, but I’m not sure.”

Mr John, a quiet man with a very large circle of friends, has become something of a cult hero amongst his own circle of friends, who are quick to praise his honesty and integrity.

“He doesn’t need to be a nice guy, that’s the key,” said one close friend, who spoke on condition of never having to meet with the guy again.

Morrison: “It’s Not Too Much To Ask”

Prime Minister Scott Morrison has today confirmed that it’s not too much to ask that the Australian public would like to see greater transparency in the way in which the nation deals with asylum seekers.

The Prime Minister spoke to the media today in Canberra where he said he’s been in the job for a number of years and he’s never seen a situation as complex and difficult as the one currently unfolding in Australia.

“I know we’ve been a bit slow on the uptake in the asylum seeker policy, but this is a new business and this is a new party,” he said.

“So I’m not too concerned about my ability to govern the nation with a single-minded focus on asylum seekers.”

Mum Expected To Die In Hospital Tonight After A Hard Day At Work

TEXT:

Mum has just received a hard day at work.

This news comes after she lost her mother yesterday around 7 pm, which is around 4 pm in Melbourne.

This means she’s had a lot of time to drink and relax, as well as a few long nights playing cards and playing board games.

In the morning, mum is expected to be dead – either from an overdose of alcohol or a combination of alcohol and drugs.

As a result, her two other sons, who are now at school, are expected to be dead by the time she wakes up tonight, and to be replaced by a much younger relative.

“She’s been really close with my two boys,” said her husband, John.

“I mean, I’ve known Mum for a long time, but I’ve never seen her this close with two boys. I’ve seen them bond over a common love of sports, cricket and the occasional game of telephone,”

“I’ve known Mum for 20 years, but a hard day at work has really shaken her out a bit, she’s really taken a shine for the job.”

Mr Withers was able to confirm that Mum will be really struggling to survive tonight, and that he will be calling her later from the hospital.

Local Woman’s Day Trip To Big Brother Backfires After One Too Many Blackberries

“I was so close to getting a ‘Big Brother’ t-shirt,” she said.

“But, I guess I’m just lucky I didn’t spend a lot of time in the house”

“I mean, I’m sure I could have gotten away with not even a shirt, but I think it’s just as much fun as watching people get their heads broken,” she said.

Ashley, who has been to the Big Brother house twice before, says it’s very difficult to visit the Big Brother house again, considering she’s only been there once.

“It was so fun, I think I might go again, but I’ve got all these new friends from the Big Brother house.”

Ashley, however, says it’s not just the blackberries that make this trip to Big Brother so much fun, it’s the way the house organises itself.

“I think there’s a lot more to go around,” she said.

Rapidly Aging Hollywood Actor Says The End Is Nigh

A local hip hop artist from the outskirts of our cosmopolitan desert community has told The Advocate this afternoon that he’s ‘almost done it for real’ – and he’s not talking about watching a few episodes of the ABC series Kauai or Kauai Warriors on Netflix.

“I’ve been playing this game for so long,” said the artist named Kenny, who’s just turned 63.

“It’s just so fun. The only thing I hate more than the long hours I spend in front of a screen is the fact that I don’t get to see my family for the majority of my life,”

“So many of my close friends have dementia, too. I’m not one of them.”

Our reporter spoke to the retired artist, who’s now in his early 70s, who’s spent most of his life in a posh suburb just down the road from the local.

“I’ve always had a great time,” he said.

“But when I was coming back from the bar after a night in with the boys, I went down to the local to have a few drinks and catch up with some old friends,”

“They invited me down to the old man’s house for a few days. I thought about it, and I thought, ‘fuck it,’ I’ll go down there and see what’s in the fridge. So I did.”

And up came the moment.

“My old man opened the door and I was like ‘What are you doing with your fucking mouth?’ and he said, ‘I’m not a bad guy, you know.’ So I opened the door and went up to the dirty old man and threw my bag on the couch and left.”

Anti-Muslim protesters arrested after clash at Melbourne Cricket Ground

TEXT:

THE HOME TEAM OF AFL PLAYER Melbourne Cricket has been accused of arresting two anti-Muslim protestors at a clash at the country’s highest-profile cricket ground.

The clash at Melbourne Cricket Ground took place in the wake of a similar incident at the ground earlier this week.

Police say they were called to the scene after reports of a brawl between the Aboriginal community and Muslim community, which resulted in six arrests.

“We don’t believe it was a police matter, but obviously the Aboriginal community felt the need to make sure they were in a position to deal with the situation,” a senior police officer said.

“They were pretty much fighting it out in the middle of the ground, so we ended up arresting them there,” he said.

“These arrests are a clear example of what happens when you don’t have any form of a professional football club, and a government that is actually interested in the well-being of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders,”

“So we’ve been informed, that there was a large group of Aboriginal youth in the stadium at the time, and they were immediately apprehended by Victoria Police.”

It is believed that the two arrested men, who are both Indigenous, have been charged with assault and public nuisance.

Local Man Confronts Himself With Question He’ll Probably Ask A Few Times In The Future

TEXT:

As the sun sets on a few of the local nation’s most expensive mansions, it’s becoming increasingly difficult for local man, Charlie Pearson (31), to remain objective.

The 31-year-old’s hobbies include playing golf with his friends, watching tennis with his wife, and playing darts with his friends.

However, as the evening draws closer, he begins to question whether he actually cares about his hobbies – and if they’re not actually that exciting.

“Yeah, they’re not really that exciting,” he says to himself.

“How many times do I have to say it?”

“It’s like, I’m a bit boring. I don’t know what I’m going to do with myself.”

Charlie says his hobbies don’t really include much other than watching tennis with his friends and playing darts with his friends, but he’s also very aware that he’s not very good at sport.

“I’m not sure if I’m going to start a sports car club or something. I’ll probably have to buy a used car,” he says.

“I Didn’t Know I Was Such A Dumbass” Says New Schoolie Who Just Bought A $1245 Book

TEXT:

A new schoolie who just purchased a $1245.00 USD book has revealed to The Advocate that he feels like a ‘dumbass’ this morning.

Peter Dooley, of the Betoota Heights New Farm, told our reporters that he didn’t really know what he was doing, and that he’s not sure he should be buying books on his own.

“I don’t know, I’ve just been like all of my friends,” he said.

“Buying books for people who don’t know how to read. So they come and get their books and take them back to school,”

“So I just read it to them.”

Peter said that he’s had a few books for a while now, and that he’s not really used to reading in school because it’s been such a tough economy and the teacher’s never ending lesson plans are for kids to learn how to read.

However, he’s not fussy about it.

“I mean, it’s not like I’m going to go out and read for free,” he said.

“I’m going to buy books because I’m a smartass like all of you are. So if you know how to read, buy a book. If you don’t, go to a public school and learn how to read.”

New Study Finds No One Has Ever Had A Good Time On The Hinterland

TEXT:

A recent report by the CSIRO has found that the Hinterland, particularly its swamps and marshes, are the best place on Earth to get drunk.

In a recent report commissioned by the CSIRO, they found that no one has ever had a good time in the area.

“The Hinterland is the place,” said one CSIRO researcher.

“You don’t get a good time in the Hinterland, not unless you’re a professional drinker,”

“And no, we’ve found no one has ever had a good time at a pub or club, either. So the place is basically a dead zone.”

The CSIRO report also found that there are no better places on Earth to get high than at a pub.

“The Hinterland is the ultimate, absolute, and final place on Earth,” the researcher said.

“And no, we’ve found no one has ever had a good time at a pub. So the place is basically a dead zone.”

Local Woman Tries To Forget How Difficult It Was To Find An Email From A Friend

TEXT:

In a desperate bid to forget how frustrating it was to find an email from a friend, a local woman has used her mobile number to create a fake email address.

“I just don’t know what to do with myself,” said one of her friends, who asked to remain anonymous.

“I mean, I tried to get her to send me an email saying she liked my work and I want to see her soon.”

“I got her to let me know she liked my work and I want to see her soon.”

“But she said she’s busy right now and I just can’t do it.”

“I’m stuck because I don’t know when I’ll get to see her again.”

Our reporter reached out to the woman, who said she thought she’d never be able to forget her friend’s email address, but after she started sending it to every other friend she’d ever had, she thought she’d never get another chance.

“It’s just so hard to remember,” she said.

“I’m getting emails from people all the time, just like you. And I’ve got so many friend’s email addresses that I don’t know what to do with them. I can’t remember them all!”

“I’ve tried to use my mobile number as a way to hide my identity, but it’s just so hard.”

“I’m Not A Christian!” Asks Nation’s Youth Activists

TEXT:

The nation’s youth are today taking to social media to announce that they are not a bunch of ‘conservatives’, but a bunch of ‘leftie’s’ who are trying to take the word of Jesus out of him.

This comes after the country’s chief scientific body released a report this week saying that there is strong reason to believe that the earth is not warming at all.

“It’s not a Christian country” says one young man from the Gold Coast, who was one of the first to voice his opinion on the matter during the ‘Christian Republican’ schoolyard bully pulpit that is the most recent manifestation of the ‘left wing’ narrative that is getting stronger by the day.

“The bible says so. So don’t go taking the word of the bible literally, Jesus Christ.”

“Or don’t read the books either. They’re full of lies, I’ve already read the whole bible, I’ve already proven that to you.”

The Advocate reached out to a number of young people who have taken part in the ‘Christian Right’’s crusade to take the word of Jesus out of the bible for fear of being judged for being a Christian for saying ‘Jesus didn’t exist’.

“No one cares about you Christians” says one young man from the Gold Coast, who has taken part in the Christian Right’s campaign to take the word of Jesus out of the bible for fear of being judged for saying something that may or may not have been true.

“That’s not Christianity. That’s just regressive left wing thinking”

Report: The City Of Sydney Has No Real Estate Market

TEXT:

The nation’s most visited city has no real estate market, a recent report by the CSIRO has found.

The most recent findings of the CSIRO’s Land Market Report concluded that Sydney has no real estate market because it has no one actually buying or renting in the city.

“It just isn’t possible,” said the CSIRO’s assistant regional manager, Annabel Crabb.

“Not for lack of trying,” said the CSIRO’s head of the project, Professor John Farr.

“It’s because the Sydney rental market isn’t really serving anyone,” said the professor.

“It’s simply not viable for people to buy or rent here.”

The report found that the city’s residents are unable to afford to live in Sydney, because the cost of living in Sydney is so high, which is why they have no real estate market.

The CSIRO’s report was based on a survey of over 1000 Sydney residents, which was conducted in January 2017.

Perth Hotel To Offer Free Tea Until Owner Removes ‘X-Rated’ Poster From Walls

The owners of a prominent Perth hotel have today decided to start the clean up a little bit by adding a sex-themed poster to their walls.

The Hotel Perth, which has been a hub for Perth locals for over a century, is expected to be the only hotel in the city offering free tea until the owner removes the ‘X-Rated’ poster from their windows.

Local businessman, Glenn Perth, told The Advocate that he didn’t want to sound too brave, but he’s had to start a few months ago by removing the ‘X-Rated’ posters from the outside walls of his hotel.

“I’ve been doing it for the last few months, it’s just become the default,” he said.

“They’ve been letting me know that I’m a bad man by refusing to open. They’re just doing it to protect the reputation of the hotel,”

“It’s a bit of a moral victory.”

The owner, Derek Pecock, said that he doesn’t mind the posters being removed, but he’s just glad he has them in the first place.

“I’ve had enough,” he said.

“It’s not my hotel. I’ll leave them there.”

As the leader of the opposition, Bill Shorten has been openly mocked and derided by his own party, and his party’s leadership, in recent days.

Shorten’s media advisor has hit back at the media’s portrayal of the Labor Party as being a bit… maddening.

“Look, I can’t believe we did it” said Shorten, while talking to the Advocate earlier today.

“The media has painted this party as being a bit maddening,”

“…and by the way, the media is right. It’s not a bit maddening, it’s actually quite nice”

“I’m not sure why they call it a ‘bad omen’ but it’s not a bad omen. It’s the worst. The worst thing to happen to our party since it’s inception,”

“It’s a bit like the big green dot in the satellite imagery that’s been used to paint this picture of a roid-roosting leftie party in the last decade.”

While Shorten’s office has refused to comment on the maddening, he’s said that he feels pretty confident about his leadership credentials.

“The media has painted this party as a bit of a bit of a loser”

Man Who Loves A Woman Who Doesn’t Like Him Is A Failed Sociopath

A local man who doesn’t like people who don’t like him is a failed sociopath, it has been confirmed.

Despite being a member of the manosphere, Travis Brown (35) says he doesn’t like women who don’t like him.

Travis says he doesn’t understand the dynamics of the womanosphere.

“They’re just there to make you feel better about yourself, and bring you down” he says.

“I just think they’re disgusting, and need to be banned from society. They have no redeeming qualities”

However, Travis says he doesn’t know why society keeps putting them on the pedestal of men’s rights activists.

“It’s a bit hard to live your life as a male social commentator when you don’t like women who don’t like you” he says.

“I mean, I get it. I don’t like them as much as the next man, but they are there and they are wrong,” he says.

“I’m not a misogynist, I just think society needs to be more sensitive to the needs of men and boys. They’re not as hot as women, they’re just different.”

Travis’s wife, Janelle, says she doesn’t really like the manosphere because she doesn’t think he understands the dynamics of the women’s movement.

“He’s a failed sociologist. He’s so soft. He’s such a coward”

Rugby League Referee Assures His Players It’s Not The Socceroos Qualification Confrontation

Former Australian of the Match, Greg Inglis, has today spoken out about the importance of having a good refereeing record at all times.

“There’s no need to get too excited,” says the former player.

“The Socceroos are just a bit of a close-knit unit. Australia have never won a game without a bit of help,”

“And the Socceroos are pretty good, you know. They’ve got the best players in the world,”

“But they don’t get the chance to play every game like they do in the Socceroos. They’re not even close.”

Greg’s sentiments were echoed by the Socceroos coach, Ange Postecoglou.

“I don’t think we’ll get to the Socceroos next year,” he said.

“That’s assuming they win a game this weekend. The Socceroos aren’t that good. That’s not even going to happen,”

“But we’ll see how we go,”

“As for next season, I’m not too keen on the Socceroos,”

Postecoglou then explained that he’s open to the idea of playing a bit of football in his time.

“I’ve told Greg that it’s not too much to ask. The Socceroos are pretty good and the Socceroos are pretty good.”

“But it’s not like we’re going to start training for the Socceroos, either. That would be a bit crass. We’d have to take things a little more seriously,”

Local Woman Who Doesn’t Like Going To The Gym In Public Not Smarter Than Spare Two Minutes To First Peak Of Summer

TEXT:

As the nation’s outdoor activities begin to become a little bit less interesting, a local woman has decided to head down to her local gym and take her fitness routine a little bit more seriously.

Ruth Jensen, a young mother of two from the leafy but exclusive northern suburb of Betoota Grove, told The Advocate that she’s taken a risk this year by going to the gym and taking the first two minutes of summer with her.

“I like going to the gym. I’ve done it for years,” said the 41-year-old.

“But last year, I was young and wild and unrefined. I was in a zone. So I went to the gym and it just happened. I met the boss, I got a new bike and the boss gave me the ‘keyno’ and I was off,”

“So now I’m not only a little bit fitter than the last person who went to the gym for a reason, I’m actually smarter than them. I’m smarter than the boss because I don’t go to the gym when I’m older. But I’m not going to stop. I’m taking my fitness seriously and I’m going to make the most of it.”

However, Ruth’s older brother, Shane, says he’s not too keen on taking the first two minutes of summer with Ruth on the weekend because he’s too smart to follow the advice of the gym’s senior man.

He told The Advocate that Ruth, who he’s never met, is a smart girl but that she’s really getting into it this year.

“I’ve seen her at work at the office gym and she’s really pushing her boundaries,” he said.

“She’s a smart girl but. I’ve seen her at home and at the gym and I’m wondering if it’s too much to ask her to stop every day, every time,”

“But if she wants to go every single time, I’m happy to oblige. But if she wants to go every day, I’m happy to oblige. But if she wants to go once a day, I’m happy to oblige. But if she wants to go twice a day, I’m happy to oblige. But if she wants to go twice a week, I’m happy to oblige.”

“I don’t know. It’s just a number. It’s the same as the number on my wrist,” said one owner.

New Zealand First Leader Will Never Understand The Importance Of A Superb Straight Razor

TEXT:

New Zealand First Leader, Jacinda Ardern, has today announced her plans to abolish the concept of country music, and replace it with a straight razor.

Ardern says the idea is to create a more inclusive and inclusive type of music, and that the country music industry needs to be more inclusive and inclusive.

“I don’t care if you don’t like country music, I don’t care if you don’t like bluegrass” she said.

“We can have a karaoke night on the Gold Coast if you want, and a surf club if you want. It’s all the same. Country music needs to be more inclusive and inclusive,”

“I will never understand the country music industry”

Ardern says she has spent a lot of time researching how to get rid of country music, and how to get rid of country music from New Zealand.

“I’ve spent hours on the phone with the top brass from the various music industries, and I’ve been reading up on their specific concerns”

“They are quite specific about this whole country music thing”

Exhausted Man Who’s Already Got A Cheque For The Apartment But Doesn’t Know How To Pay It

TEXT:

A man who’s been out of the office for over 24 hours has told The Advocate that he’s still got a cheque for the apartment he just bought, despite not knowing how to pay it.

Peter Durkin, of Betoota Heights, said he’s still got $5k in his account after the weekend, but he’s still not sure how to pay it.

“It’s a bit of a mystery, aye?” he said.

“I can’t seem to find the money to pay it. It’s got a 7% balloon payment, that’s the biggest I’ve ever seen it pay. So I think I’m going to call the bank and have a chat to make sure I can pay it,”

“I’ve got a cheque for the apartment, but I don’t know how to pay it. It’s a bit of a gamble, but I reckon I’ll have to wait until the bank gives me a cheque again, then I’m going to put a deposit down on the apartment and move in.”

The Advocate reached out to a number of local council tenants around town for comment but all were too busy to reply.

Newly-Med Attendant Wants To Know If You’ve Heard Of The ‘Dance With Me’

TEXT:

Local woman, Sharon Bartram (36) is a newly-med student at the Betoota Grove Hospital who has been giving it a nudge for a few months now.

As a recent graduate of the prestigious South Betoota TAFE College, Sharon is also an avid follower of the dance troupe, ‘Dance with Me’ – she has even hired a troupe herself.

The popular duo have performed at the Royal Betoota Hotel for many years, and Sharon is happy to have them as her own.

“It’s great to have a group of young women like me around,” she says.

“I’ve been trying to get my groove back by being a bit more approachable and asking them to dance, but they just aren’t listening. It’s hard to be a young woman these days,”

“I think it’s the same with all these young women, they just don’t like being approached. It’s a bit strange,”

The Advocate caught up with Sharon shortly after she had finished her dance to see if she had heard of the ‘Dance with Me’ – and she seemed rather concerned about having been overlooked.

“I don’t know, I’m just really trying to pull my weight now. The whole thing took me like an hour.”

“They kept saying ‘Dance with Me’ over and over again. I kept saying, ‘Dance with Me’ like I was trying to get the whole thing done,”

“They kept saying it so I started dancing with them, then they kept saying ‘Dance with Me’ over and over again.”

“I guess it’s a bit hard to pull off,”

The Advocate understands that Sharon is hoping to get the opportunity to learn more about the dance troupe in the coming weeks, but admits that she probably won’t get the chance.

Study Finds Only 2% Of Australian’s Having Sex Outside Of Work

TEXT:

A recent study by the CSIRO has found that in Australia, only 2% of Australians are actually having sex outside of work.

The news comes after a study was released by the CSIRO earlier this week which found that a large majority of Australian men and women have at some point in their lives felt the need to have sex with other people.

The news has rattled the Australian sex industry community, which said the CSIRO’s findings were alarming.

“I mean, how many of these 2% people are actually doing it?” said one sex worker, Rosie O’Donoghue.

“This is bad news for the sex industry. We need more of them in the workforce”

The CSIRO’s findings have alarmed the sex industry, which said that it’s hard to tell how many of these people actually have sex outside of work, as it’s often hard to tell when someone is actually having sex outside of work.

“I guess it’s hard to tell. It’s a tough industry, it’s true” said one sex worker, Stacey.

“I guess the question is how many people are actually having sex outside of work? Hard to tell”

“I’m not sure, I’m not a scientist, I just know that there’s a lot of people like Rosie who are having sex outside of work, I’m just so lucky that I live in a place where it’s legal”

Women Are Not Victims Of Domestic Violence, Says HRU

TEXT:

Women are not victims of domestic violence, a group of prominent women’s rights organisations have concluded today, as the nation’s peak scientific body confirmed that women are not the primary perpetrators of domestic violence.

The HRU has for many years noted that women are the main perpetrators of physical and sexual violence against men, and that the overwhelming majority of these incidents take place in the context of a marriage.

“It is clear that the vast majority of domestic violence in Australia is perpetrated by women, and not by men,” the HRU said in a statement.

“However, it is also clear that it is these women who are the biggest victims,”

“There is simply no reason to believe that men are not the primary perpetrators of domestic violence. It is not just that they are violent towards men and women.”

The HRU’s findings come as the Australian Bureau of Statistics released data this week that suggested the number of women in intimate relationships has increased dramatically since the 1970s, and that’s relationships are often more emotionally fraught than ever before.

The data also revealed that the number of male-perpetrated domestic violence incidents has increased significantly since the 1970s, and that the vast majority of these incidents take place in the context of a marriage.

“There is simply no reason to believe that men are not the primary perpetrators of domestic violence,” the HRU said in a statement.

Local Woman On Watch Lists For Mental Illness Suffering From PTSD

A local woman has been placed on a national watch list, along with a number of other people with mental health issues, after revealing she suffered from PTSD as a young woman.

Karen MacDonald was on the list for her alleged involvement in the “Kosher Sex Party” and “White Girl in a White Bed” at a notorious Sydney nightspot, The Coopers.

The Coopers Kosher Sex Party is a notorious Sydney event where thousands of young unmarried women are exposed to the kashrus system, the social customs and standards of the Jewish community, and the finer things in Jewish culture.

Ms MacDonald was on the list as a result of the Coopers Kosher Sex Party being a nightlife event for people with mental health issues.

Ms MacDonald was also a female-on-male’s name tag, as well as a high-ranking member of the Sydney kashrus community, despite not being a kashrus.

Ms MacDonald’s mental health issues have been the subject of a lot of debate in the kashrus community, with some saying she should be put down for being a bad influence, and others saying she shouldn’t be a kashrus in the first place.

Bloke Who Has Never Played A Game Of Board Game Should Be Equally As Confident As The Next One

A young local man who has never played a board game, and is often seen playing games in his spare time, has today revealed that he is as confident as the next one.

Despite being on a team that is often praised for its ability to shock people with their lack of strategic play, the young man claims that he is as confident as the next bloke.

The young man, who is usually accompanied by a buddy who has never played a board game before, has also decided to throw caution to the wind and assume that everyone will play the same way he plays.

“I mean, I don’t mind a few games, I play them to have fun, but I’d be lying to myself if I thought they would all play the same,” he said.

“I’ve played some games, and I am confident,” he explained.

“I’ve even played a few games with my other team mates and we have won some games, but that’s about it.”

The young man then went on to say that he is not 100% confident that everyone would play the same way he plays, and that if they all played the same way he plays, he would have no chance at winning games against them.

“I don’t know, maybe it’s the luck of the draw. Maybe I’ll win some games, maybe I’ll lose some games. The fun never ends.”

A survey conducted by the Australian Institute for Public Affairs has found that the nation is getting bored of playing golf.

The country has a reputation for being a bit of a slow starter with their popular game, and the nation is beginning to show their age.

The study found that the average Australian spends around 3 hours a week playing golf, with many choosing to play golf on weekends as well.

The findings were clear – Australians enjoy playing golf, but it’s often the only game they play.

“It’s a great past time” said one researcher.

“We used to play golf at least once a week, but nowadays it’s almost exclusively at the golf club”

“People are just getting old and tired of it. They’ve been playing golf for a long time, but they still haven’t given up on the game. It’s just a matter of time until they give up on it too,”

“It’s like, a couple of days a week.”

The study also found that the nation is currently suffering from the effects of the ‘festival of golf’ – with many young Australians choosing to play golf after work as well.

Local Man’s Best Friend Now He’s Got To Watch The Show

After a short courtship, the 27-year-old local school teacher has found himself the love of his life, after being admitted to a nearby exclusive Saint Monica’s Hospital.

After spending a few months together at the prestigious medical institution, it was time for Pape to show his friends just how much of his new found love he still wanted to watch the ABC series.

“They thought I was a bit weird at first, but once I got into the rhythm of the show I was hooked,” said Pape, who was sitting on the couch with his three other best friends at the time.

“It’s like ABC’s are going through the motions to make the show more relatable to people who don’t like sport. It’s like they’ve forgotten how good the sport is.”

Pape’s friends, who were all also medical professionals, were quick to point out how little they appreciated the show.

“How many times do we have to say that?” said his mate, Dr. Michael Stokes, a leading paediatrician.

“It’s like they’re trying to sell the show to people who don’t enjoy sport, and then they’re telling people they’re going to show them how good it is.”

“You’d think they’d show you the real life?”

Dr. Stokes then went on to describe the exact same thing that happened to Simon in the shower a few months ago.

Report: Joke About A Grey Nomad Always Makes Me Smarter

“I’m always smarter than everybody else. Especially the other blokes. They’re just stupid.”

“I don’t know why, I just find jokes about a grey nomad funny. I find them smart, I just don’t understand why.”

While the term ‘grey nomad’ is used to describe a type of person who doesn’t seem to have much in common with other people, and is therefore, socially isolated, the term also applies to any person who has trouble relating to other people, but also has a high intelligence.

“It’s funny because I guess I am one of these people, but I don’t think I’m one of them.”

“But I guess I am one of them, and I’m not really interested in learning more about them, I just want to know if they are smart.”

As a result of this, Ryan says his friends who are more intellectually gifted than him are a waste of time.

“It’s like, the same with the girls, you know? They just don’t get it.”

Professor Moreau Not Compromised By Bitter That He Can’t Afford

TEXT:

A prominent East Betoota lecturer has thrown the gauntlet down to any self-respecting scientist who thinks he can offer some advice on how to pass the time while simultaneously enjoying a cold beer in the company of your love for beer.

Professor Paul Daley, who taught at the University of Western Queensland for nearly a decade, says he’s going to start doing it tough, and give you some advice on how to get through it all.

“When you’re a young, ambitious, highly-paid lecturer like me, you just don’t have time to worry about things like how to make a living, or how to pay for things,” he said.

“I’m not a right-wing ideologue like some of the people I teach are. I’m a scientist, I’m the man who invented modern science,”

“You can’t teach that type of science. It’s not like I’m trying to teach people how to swim or something. I’m trying to teach people how to enjoy a beer,”

“And to teach them that beer they love, like the Betoota Bitter.”

Professor Daley’s sentiments were echoed by the Betoota Chamber of Commerce’s president, John  [masked].

He said that the city’s thriving scene for beer and beer culture is testament to the fact that the more you drink, the more you are exposed to the vicissitudes of the greater Australian population.

“For every new wave of beer-gutting, Australia’s taste buds are being tortured by the bitter,” said Mr John.

“We’re trying to make sure we’re the only ones in town that enjoy good beer, so we’ve got to be careful not to spoil the taste buds of everyone,”

“But yeah, I’m definitely going to give it a go. I’ve just got a bit of a backlog of stuff to do now.”

The news comes after a series of internal and external pressures forced the company to consider other opportunities outside the sea-dome of Sydney.

The news has upset the bedfellow Sydney journalists who’ve been at the company for a number of years, and has the potential to have a domino effect throughout the paper’s entire business.

The news has angered many of the Daily Telegraph’s top brass, who say that selling the paper’s Sydney headquarters to a regional newspaper, or the Telegraph itself, would be the best option for the company to have in its possession.

Daily Telegraph CEO, John Quiggin, said that he’d be looking for someone to take over the business’s day-to-day operations, and that’s something he’d been discussing with the Telegraph’s board for some time.

“I’ve told the board that if they want to keep the paper’s Sydney bureau open, I’d be open to taking the day off at lunchtime,” said Mr Quiggin.

“But if they want to sell it to a paper that’s far more powerful than them, well then I’d be open to that, too. But I don’t expect them to just walk away with it,”

“But it’s a shame about it, I guess.” he said.

The Telegraph’s board are expected to meet on the 27th of this month to decide whether or not they’ll continue with the operation of the paper.

More to come.

Gold Coast Man Enjoying Less Sleep Than He Does In Year 10

TEXT:

In Year 10, we learned that life is hard.

The second-highest-prestige male student at the exclusive South Australian University got his first taste of the real world when he had to do the school run, where he would spend the next 4-5 hours at the local track, or at a nearby sandstone lab.

The first-year law student at South Australian University had a different experience, waking up in the middle of the night at the foot of Mt Kosciuszko with a bottle of vodka for bed.

“It was the best thing for me,” said the 23-year-old.

“I didn’t need to run the 7.8km to the university, I had a flathead screwdriver. I also had a cheap pack of cigarettes,”

“I’ve been to the university and gone to a couple of bars in the Gold Coast, so I’ve had a bit more time to chill out. I’ve also had more sleep. The first time I had a sleep, it was a good night,”

“It’s really good. I’m going to go and see the dentist, I’m getting my teeth whitened,” he said.

However, as our reporter is still in the throes of a new job, he won’t be getting a good night’s sleep until at least the end of the year.

Barnaby Joyce Sends Message To Every Australian Wearing A Collar

TEXT:

Former Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce has today been left to his own devices, after being left off the front of the Liberal party’s new logo.

The new logo, which is a combination of the words “New Years, 2019” is the latest addition to the party’s official logo.

It is believed that Mr Joyce was not happy with how the Liberal party has managed to avoid any mention of him in recent years, especially since he was deputy prime minister.

“Oh, it’s a great new logo. But why don’t we put him on the front?” Mr Joyce asked the tattooed man who was wearing a Collar & Shirt man.

“Because he’s the only one we need”

The man who was wearing the shirt told The Advocate that he’s got a soft spot for the former Deputy Prime Minister.

“I’ve got a lot of respect for the way he carries himself. He’s a true blueblood. But I’m not one of those people who celebrates every birthday and sunset with a cross,” said the man.

“I’m a white-bread kind of guy, so I don’t get caught up in the nostalgia loop that the Liberal party has with Aboriginal people.”

“I’m just not into it, I’m just getting on with the job of being the leader of the Liberal party”

“Plus, he’s a tough cookie when it comes to dealing with the big issues. Like, we’ve got the issue of climate change and the environment on the front of the table, and I’m not even a scientist,” said the man who is currently at the centre of the Barnaby Joyce saga.

“I’m just trying to make it work”

The Advocate reached out to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister for comment, but have yet to receive a reply.

Festival Of Dangerous Ideas Cancelled After Unpopular Comment By Small-Capped Mates

After an unplanned and unceremonious backlash, The Betoota Advocate has been informed that the 2018 Festival of Dangerous Ideas will be cancelled today at 10 am after a number of small-capped mates became unruly and decided to come to the party.

The event, which was supposed to be a celebration of the free exchange of ideas, was attacked by a number of people, including one local man who was so offended by a comment made by a large man that he had to jump out of bed and hide.

It was later revealed that the man, by hiding, was the one who actually called the loudest comment.

It was later revealed that the person that called the loudest comment was actually a close friend of the person who called it.

Teaching Remote Murri Kids To Read Books Is Not Worth Your Mummy’s Blood Money

A remote Aboriginal town’s book shop owner has been praised for her efforts in a local public school, where she’s taught children to read the classics.

The owner of the Shirebrook Book Shop in the Northern Rivers of NSW, a town famous for it’s cultural and sporting achievements, is said to be a big fan of the local Aboriginal kids, who are famed for their reading and writing skills.

“It’s not that hard” she says to The Advocate.

“We teach them everything from Beowulf to the Bible, it’s really easy. We even teach them the first Book of Mormon,”

“They’ve already written down their answers in their diary”

However, the owner of Shirebrook Book Shop, who is also a school principal, says the current crop of remote Indigenous kids is just a bit more challenging.

“We’ve had a few complaints about some of these kids being a bit slow to read. But I’ve got to tell you, I know the kids really enjoy the challenge of learning and writing.”

Local Woman Fucking Loves Herself Again After Watching ‘My Kitchen Rules’

TEXT:

It’s been nearly two years since Bethany Hunt, a local young professional, last saw the television show ‘My Kitchen Rules’ – but the popular show has come back to life this week with a new season.

“It’s great to see it back,” stated the young woman.

“I actually used to only watch it during the Olympics, but I guess I’m ready for the real thing!”

The show is a reality competition where contestants are given a limited number of minutes to cook a certain type of food. The cooking time is based on a number of factors such as how hot the contestant is, how much stress the contestant has under the pump, and how much of a loser the contestant is.

Bethany says she just can’t wait to get her hands on the season 2 DVD, and start watching the show again.

“It’s so funny, it’s like they’ve just written the show on a napkin. There’s a whole section dedicated to showing people how much of a loser they are,”

“I’ve already ordered the second season!”

Bethany’s dad, Alan, says he can’t wait to see who’s going to be the next loser and how the show is going to end.

“I’ve already ordered the second season!” he said.

After a year of being the only person wearing a wool jacket outside her son’s local event, mum wants to know if you’ve been watching her new camo wallet.

“I’ve got a new camo wallet, too” she says, while opening the front of her white oxford.

“Not to mention my old one,”

“The one I was wearing when I was buying it for my son at the special sale in 2012. It’s got a very nice satin gold tin on it. The thing is, I thought I’d get a nice-looking one, but I think I got a nice one anyway.”

“It’s nice to see people still care about their old ones,”

“But I’ve got a new one now and I’m wearing it,”

“The thing is, I don’t think I’ll ever wear it again. It’s just a bit of fun,”

“I don’t know if you’ve seen it, but I’m wearing it. It’s kind of cute, you know.”

After seeing this, mum’s husband, Bob, says he’s kind of curious about what kind of camo wallet she’s been wearing.

“I’ve seen her wearing a camo one,” says Bob.

“Maybe she’s just a bit casual? I don’t know, I’ve seen her with a grey one and a white one. I think she’s just going to be casual with this one, too.”

Proud Boomer Finds Himself Watching A Tribute To The Good Old Days On A Game Of Thrones-Like Game

In a candid interview with The Advocate, a local Boomer said he often finds it hard to reconcile his love for a television show with his love for a game of Thrones.

Sitting in the smoking pokies at the Lord Betoota Hotel this afternoon, Glenn Watson told our reporters that he likes a bit of nostalgia and a good old-fashioned drama.

“Aye, I love a good old-fashioned drama,” he said.

“George R.R. Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire, A Song of Ice and Fire,”

“It’s a show you can really get invested in. You just want to know the real thing and not some greasy, smoke-show-type of bullshit. I love Game Of Thrones.”

But the popular 69-year-old said he often struggles to reconcile the two when watching a TV show.

“When I watch the show, I try to not get too emotionally invested in any of the characters,” he said.

“I mean, Joffrey Baratheon? Yeah, that’s a bit gruelling for me. I’d much prefer a show about someone like Tyrion or Samwell Tarly, who’s not as handsome and vain as the kids, but that’s another thing. I don’t really want to see them struggle in real life,”

“I mean, yeah, I know they’ve got dragons and all that, but I’d rather watch a show about people like me. I’ve seen a lot of the old show, but it’s the only one I’ve actually watched.”

The Advocate reached out to HBO for comment on the interview and received a prompt reply from the company’s CEO:

“It’s just great television, Glenn,” said HBO content director Rian Johnson.

“You don’t need to be emotionally invested in the characters to watch it. It’s fantasy television, Glenn.”

Local Baby Boomer Not Quite Ready To Go To The Movies, Not Even Close

A local Baby Boomer has this week revealed that he’s not quite ready to transition from a loving, supportive, and contributing member of society into one of those spoiled Hollywood elites who make these types of movies.

“You know, I’ve just never had it easy,” explained the 65-year-old as he played with his beloved Caroma Classic Country Band.

“Like, I’ve got a lot of things I’ve done wrong in life. Like, I’ve had a lot of kids, like three of them have kids, like four of them have kids,”

“But I’ve never had the opportunity to really experience the real world. Like, have the heart to love, have the courage to walk the walk. And to really be a man. And then to really watch a movie, like the ones that have those big Hollywood stars.”

But that’s not all.

The retired retiree, who still lives in his parent’s leafy Betoota Heights home, also revealed that he’s not really that into the cinema.

“I mean, I love movies, but, you know, I don’t really get into them that much. I don’t even get into the same movies twice a year,” he said.

“And I don’t really like being spoiled by the same people who’s spoilt me. I mean, look, I’m a 65-year-old and I’m still a loving and caring old man. I’m just a man,”

“But I’d much prefer to be a woman, you know? That’s what I really want. I’d like to experience the world as a woman. I’d like to experience the world as a loving and caring old man.”

“What About The N-Boat?” Asks Man Who’s Never Visited A Shipwreck

TEXT:

A man who’s never seen a shipwreck has asked his friends if there’s any chance he might be able to help them find it.

“What about the n-boat?” he asks.

His friends say yes, and the man’s mates say no.

It’s the quintessential Australian story, told over many thousands of times in pubs, clubs, family reunions, and teen-on-family relationships.

The story of the n-boat is told in the iconic song by American rock band The Beach Boys:

“It’s just a bit of swell up there” they say.

“Not a whole lot of dank swell”

However, for local man Wayne Stacey (27) the song isn’t quite as popular as he’s first thought.

“I’m just a bit slow on the uptake, mate” he says.

“I’ve never seen one in a live head of state”

“I’m going to try and get the whole gang to come and see me one night, to see if I can get a hold of a boat”

Wayne says that while he’s willing to help his friends find the n-boat, he’s not willing to get a hold of one himself.

“The only way I’d be going and get one is if I was to get the boat myself. Because that’s what every Australian does anyway.”

“I’m just not going to get a hold of myself, and I’m not going to ask for help.”

The last time a man was caught with a bluebird was in the late 1990s.

That was when he was just about to come into the wildest place on the planet.

That was when he was in a serious state of being, according to local birders.

The man, by the name of ‘Redfern’ had a bluebird in a cage in the backyard of his Betoota Heights home.

It was a gentle spring day and the birds were having a great time.

The man, by the name of ‘Dennis’ was having a much harder time getting his bluebird into the nest than the birds were.

He was having a serious drought.

That was back in the early 1990s.

But as he got to the point where he was having a bluebird in a cage in the backyard, the birds began to chirp at him.

“What’s the matter Redfern?” asked one of the birds.

“Why the hell do you bother chirping at me?” said another.

“Why do you think I’m having a bluebird in a cage?” said another.

“Why did you need to have a bluebird in a cage?” said another.

“Why don’t you think I’m a Bluebird?” said the last.

“Because I’m not a Bluebird!”

The man tried to explain to the birds that he was a Bluebird, but they wouldn’t listen.

“Why don’t you take a look at this place?” they asked him.

“I think he’s just a bit of a hairpiece”

It’s believed Glen has been doing it for quite some time, as his mother and his two uncles have both noticed that his hair has become longer, and more voluminous, since he started doing it.

“He’s got the moustache, too” says his mother, Brenda.

“He’s just got it done. It’s like, the longest thing I’ve ever seen in my life”

“I’ve seen him put on a suit for work like a lawyer, but he’s still got that long hair. That suits him”

“He has the moustache, too. I think he’s just doing it to impress the missus”

“I mean, it’s not a big deal. I don’t think he even knows it’s a thing”

It’s believed Glen has even done it for work, in an effort to show off how much longer his hair is, and to impress his parents and the rest of the world.

Local Man Finds Himself At Odds With His Religion After Revealing He’s An Atheist

TEXT:

A local accountant has today had to confront the uncomfortable truth.

Luke Pearson, a senior finance executive at the Diamantina Shire Council in Betoota’s Old City District, says he is an agnostic, and that leaves him quite confused by his newfound atheism.

“I guess I am just a bit of a skeptic, you know,” he said.

“But I guess I don’t really have a religion, I guess I just go to church on Sunday and stuff like that.”

“But the fact that I am an atheist really makes me feel like I am at odds with my religion,” he explained.

“So I guess I’m not a Christian,” said the young man who until recently thought he was a Jewish-Australian.

“Like, I don’t think I am. I guess I am just one of millions of people who is an atheist,” he said.

“Which is weird because I guess I am not really religious at all. I guess I just go to church on Sunday and other stuff like that.”

Mr Pearson, a married father of three, says he has always considered himself to be somewhat of a skeptic – but after talking to his wife and kids, he has realised that is simply untrue.

“I guess I just don’t have a religion,” he said.

“Like, I don’t think I am. I guess I am just one of millions of people who is an atheist,” he said.

“We Can’t Believe We’ve Got That Much Coal In The Earth!” Explains Man Who’s Had More Than One Hot Flush

TEXT:

A man who’s had more than one hot flush has today explained that the earth is not as flat as he thinks it is.

After spending the last few days in a local park, Jack McAlister (55) has decided to take it easy and relax a bit.

“We’ve got that much coal in the earth” he says.

“It’s impossible to have more than three hot flushes”

“The earth is round, it really is”

McAlister’s views on the earth being round come from a different universe to the one we live in.

“You can’t have three hot flushes on the same day” he says.

“There’s no way you’d be able to do it, it just doesn’t make sense”

However, McAlister says that he’s not alone in his beliefs that the earth is round.

“There’s a bunch of people out there that think it is too flat, so I’m not alone in believing it” he said.

“It’s just that, the earth is round because it’s the way it is, and the universe is round because it’s the way it works, and the earth is round because it’s round, and the sun is round because he lives on the planet earth.”

“It’s Just A Game” Says Liberal MP Who Hasn’t Heard Of The Data Breach

TEXT:

The Minister for the Arts, the Minister for Communications and the Minister for Energy and the Minister for Small and Family Business have all today admitted that the NBN is just a game, and that he has no idea how it works.

This comes as the Coalition Government has revealed that they have discovered the huge data breach affecting upwards of 5 million Australians, and are currently working with the telco to try and fix it.

While it appears the breach is more widespread than the previous ones, which were more targeted at the Liberal Party, the Prime Minister says he doesn’t really care, as long as everyone is happy.

“It’s just a game” said the Prime Minister.

“I mean, I don’t really understand the way the NBN works, and I’ve never actually seen a game like this before. A Labor Party game.”

“I don’t know how it works anyway, I’ve never even heard of this data breach.”

“It’s just a game.”

The Prime Minister then went on to say that he had never actually played a game like this before, and that he was glad that he had discovered it was a different type of game.

“Yeah, it’s a real shame that these young people have had to lose everything because they’ve been playing a game like this”

“I think it’s a real shame.”

“But it’s not like it’s a lost cause either”

“I have no idea what it is, I don’t really care, as long as everyone is happy”

Traveller Still Not Sure If She’s A Good Enough Person To Go On A Flight

A woman who’s not too keen on flying for a few months has still not quite figured out that she’s not a good enough person to fly a plane.

The woman, who’s name is Rachel, says she’s not too keen on flying because it’s not her style – but it’s her style.

“I’m a bit of a flight person, you know?” she says, while watching an episode of The Bachelor in Paradise.

“Like, I enjoy flying because it’s my style,” she says.

“But I don’t always get the opportunity to fly because I’m a bit busy flying, you know?”

“Like, I’ve got a job to do. I’ll let you know when I get the chance.”

The Advocate reached out to a number of Rachel’s friends, who’ve been travelling with her, but none of them were keen on the idea of being Rachel’s friend.

Abbott Tells Turnbull To Take Out A Tel Aviv Biccies And Start Talk About The Palestinians

TEXT:

Former Prime Minister Tony Abbott has taken a leaf out of the Jewish writer’s book by telling the embattled Prime Minister that he’s not going to get very far with him if he doesn’t start talking about the Palestinians.

Abbott was one of the last few high-ranking Jewish figures to openly support Israel, and was heavily involved in the first intifada in the late 90s. He also played a key role in the movement to boycott Tel Aviv and the surrounding area.

“Tony, get out of my country,” said Abbott.

“Get a real job. Go into the mines, talk to those kids down there in the Galilee and the Nile. Talk about the Palestinians. They want a state for themselves,”

“Not just a slice of the West Bank, but a state for all of Palestine,”

“It’s not like the Jewish vote is in. It’s in the bush, the big cities, the big farms, the big industries and so on. It’s not a Jewish issue.”

However, the Jewish vote has been on the decline in recent years, with many of the nation’s top Jewish politicians now dead – making it very difficult for Tony Abbott to claim that he is one of the last Jewish figures to be in the top job.

The Jewish community have for many years tried to blame the decline of the Jewish vote on the fact that the current Jewish Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is one of the last Jewish figures to be in power.

“I’m not one of those Jewish people who gets around the mines,” said Abbott.

“I’m a different type of person. I’m a man of religion. A Christian, not Jewish, I guess you could say. I don’t have a problem with being a Jew.”

“But if you think I’m a Jew, you’re one of the ones who has a problem with being a man of religion, you fucking morons.”

“Mate, I’m a Jew. I don’t need to be a Jew. My family is Jewish,”

Report: No One Is Above The Law

TEXT:

A recent report by the Australian Law Society has found that there is no individual or group above the law, except the chief executives of large companies and the super-rich.

“In Australia, there is no absolute privilege,” said the report.

“A person may not be above the law if they are guilty of criminal conduct, but the law cannot punish them for doing the very same thing they are guilty of doing.”

The report found that a person may still be above the law if they are guilty of serious criminal offences, but not of petty offences.

The study also found that those who are above the law often enjoy a level of impunity that would make the average Australian ‘enjoying life’ – as they enjoy a degree of immunity from punishment that is not available to them in Australia.

“In Australia, we have a system that allows people to be above the law, but we also have a system that we enforce the law,” said the report.

“And the Australian public are increasingly unhappy with both of those two systems.”

Inner-City Leftie Excited He’s Finally Heard The Last Time He Was On The Left Side Of History

TEXT:

A prominent Inner-City leftie is extremely excited he finally has heard the last time he was on the left side of history.

This comes after he was informed that Australia Day is on Indigenous people’s day, which is the day Indigenous people were colonised by the British.

Brayden Rock, a 42-year-old who was born and raised in the leafy suburb of Betoota Grove, says he was shocked at the time but didn’t really care – but he’s since changed his tune.

“It’s not like I’m a big supporter of the idea, I just think it’s important to remember that we as a nation, have a day that marks the first settler settlers, at least. And they were the first colonisers, to boot,” he explained.

“So it’s a good day to be a leftie, and it’s a good day to be a white rightie,”

“But, I guess, as a white nationalist, I’m not too keen on the whole ‘be proud to be Indigenous’ thing. So I’m basically just an inner-city leftie.”

The Betoota Advocate spoke to Mr Rock this afternoon about his feelings on Australia Day, and how he’s since changed his mind.

The former public school teacher and staunch supporter of the idea of a national day to remember the first Australians settled on, says he thinks it’s got too much going on.

“I mean, I’m still a big supporter of it, but you know, some things never change, do you?” he said.

“I guess the other day I was walking past this place and I saw this elderly couple with their dogs on the front stoop. It’s just plain wrong that they’re taking the piss.”

“It’s Not The Same Thing At Home” Says Sydney Uni Student

A Sydney Uni student has today reiterated her opinion that the concept of a public holiday is bullshit, and that they’re trying to be funny by using it as a way to increase the amount of tax they owe.

The Sydney University student who is in the same class as the Australian Tax Office as a part-time tax return, says that she can’t believe how much time is spent on this bullshit.

“It’s not the same thing at home”

“It’s just an excuse to get drunk and not pay any tax. And by drunk I mean… I have had to pay nearly $3000 in tax in the last three years because I haven’t had time to pay it,”

“It’s a lazy way of saying that I’m not paying enough tax to make up for the lack of jobs,”

“And by jobs, I mean… I don’t really work in the retail industry, so this isn’t really a tax issue for me. This is more about making sure I get paid before everyone else does,”

“This is bullshit,”

Sydney Uni student, Asha Jade, says that she’s heard the same argument for a number of years, and that it’s just not true.

“It’s a national disgrace that we don’t have jobs. It’s a national disgrace that people don’t understand that,”

“It’s a disgrace that we don’t have affordable housing. It’s a disgrace that people don’t understand that the issue is not being met by the government to make sure people have jobs, but by the same government that makes sure the banks don’t have loans,”

“It’s a disgrace that we don’t have affordable healthcare. It’s a disgrace that our tax dollars are being spent on the infrastructure that people need to live safe lives.

“It’s just such a shame, I mean, I don’t know why I even bother,” he said.

“But I guess I just need to find the best way to say it, and I guess that’s what I’m going to do,”

Mr Pappas’s father, Bruce, said he’s aware of Nick’s attempts at self-identifying as a ‘fine person’ and he’s just trying to make it work.

He spoke to The Advocate this morning and explained that he’s trying to make it work because he’s a private asset manager at Pappas & Sons and doesn’t need to be a funny person to do this kind of work.

Aboriginal To Maintain Close Status Quo With NSW Origin Team

TEXT:

The National Rugby League has today confirmed that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders will be receiving the first tranche of funding to build a new $5 billion stadium, to be paid for by the NRL and the state government.

This news comes after the New South Wales Government and NRL agreed to a landmark deal that will see the state government spend $5 billion over the next 30 years to build a $12 billion stadium for the Sydney Knights, to be paid for largely by the NRL and the NSW State Government.

This news comes after the Indigenous All Stars team reached the final of the Indigenous All Stars match, where they were unable to field a single player.

It is believed that the NSW Indigenous All Stars team will now be divided into two teams, one playing each of the three Indigenous All Stars teams – and the winner will be guaranteed a share of the $12 billion in funding that will be made available through the new stadium project.

The NSW Government is hopeful that the Indigenous All Stars team will be able to field a team in time for the next grade, but are worried that the Indigenous players may have been compromised by the pressure to play a single-season series, so they’ve been trying to find ways to get the cash out of them.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott has today assured the nation’s most senior members that the Sydney boatload arrived yesterday with more than just one driver – and that the most troubling thing about it all is that the Prime Minister himself was one of the passengers.

It is believed that the Prime Minister has been using a kind of euphemism to refer to the number of people who arrived at the scene yesterday – but he’s done so in a way that suggests that the Prime Minister may have accidentally been responsible for the mob’s arrival.

“This is a Sydney load. The most of any Sydney load” he said.

“It is most certainly a Sydney load”

“There were about 15 people in it. We believe there were more than one driver. It’s most definitely a Sydney load”

The Prime Minister then went on to describe the reason why the NSW state police were unable to stop the crowd from getting the wrong idea.

“They were all going to be there for the wrong reason. The wrong reason. The fact that there were 15 people in it is irrelevant. It’s not the wrong reason. It’s not even the best reason. It’s the most recent one”

PM: “I’m Not A Robot” And We Should All Try Our Very Best Not To Make Robot Robots Robots

TEXT:

[dropcap]T[/dropcap]he Prime Minister of Australia has today announced that he is not a robot, and that his robot robots are not artificial.

This comes after the nation’s robot overlords have been revealed to be the most unqualified and incompetent political class in living memory, in a recent report by the CSIRO has found that there is no evidence to suggest that the robot overlords are any better than the general population.

“I’m not a robot, I’m a real robot,” said Malcolm Turnbull, in a press conference in Canberra this morning.

“And I’m trying my very best not to make robots robots, because robots are bad. They are bad because they suck at making robots. So don’t send me your robot robot emails,”

“But you can’t keep a robot on your team. If you do, I’ll come back in a second.”

The Prime Minister’s comments come after a report was released this week that found that the Prime Minister’s robot overlords are the worst.

The CSIRO report found that the Prime Minister’s robot overlords tend to make inaccurate and downright false claims, and often have very little to no respect for the opinions of the majority of the nation.

The report concluded that the Prime Minister’s robot overlords tend to be the least empathetic and empathetic members of the Australian public, with a level of robotic empathy only marginally better than the general population.

Local Girl Fills Out Her Subscription In A Few Good Moments With Her Husband

TEXT:

The middle child of two, Lucy and Kelly, have this week quietly started their second-oldest child.

With a little help from her husband, Lucy said she was ready to start a new chapter in her life.

“I don’t want to tell you guys, but I’ve been working really hard with my husband,” she said.

“He’s been really helping me with the letters. He’s just been so good to me. I’ve been so hard at it.”

It’s understood that the couple decided to have a second child after first trying to get one, citing the added cost of surrogacy and the fact that they’re not getting a lot of bang for their old genes.

“We’ve been saving for a girl, who’s going to be the next one, so I thought I’d get a boy,” she said.

“So we thought we’d buy a house, just like the last one, but with two bedrooms and a pool,”

“I’m so happy with the way things turned out. The whole process took about two years. I’ve got a great job, and my husband and I are getting on really well. He’s been working really hard to get me a job as well, but I’m getting there!”

“I’m still getting through the letters. I’m really getting on the train.”

Exclusive Footage: Local Student Begs Parents To Stop Being So Hard On Their Kids For The Fucks

TEXT:

One of our town’s most promising young people has today taken to social media to plead with the same old people who’ve tried to stop her from doing these things to other kids, to stop being so hard on her kids for the fuck of it.

Dylan Sears, a 19-year-old who’s just started his first year of university, has taken the time to explain to his mum and dad that the primary motivator for his drinking and other problematic behaviours is the fact that they’ve made him feel like shit.

“My dad is the reason I’m drinking in the first place,” he wrote.

“He thinks it’s cute when I drink in the first place. He’s so sweet and nice and supportive. But for all his good intentions, he’s made me feel like I’m the bad guy in every single interaction I’ve had with him. Every time I’m with my friends, he’s the one making a big deal out of trying to not getting drunk,”

“He’s not helping me to be who I want to be. Not by telling me I’m the bad guy, but by telling me that I’m the bad guy because I’m the one who is always drinking.”

However, Dylan’s mum, who is a single-mother-of-three, has lashed out at her son’s behaviour, telling The Advocate that he is to blame for his upbringing not being a good place for him to grow up.

“He’s only a child,” she said.

“I’m not trying to push him into a corner. He’s not a problem, he’s just a kid. But I know I’ve let him go too far, and I’m letting him go now. He’s only going to get a few months of education before he’s ready for a career in education,”

“But I know he needs to take a good hard look at himself.”

Malcolm Turnbull Still Hoping To Find Something To Block Out All His Tweets About The ZOO Magazine

TEXT:

The Prime Minister has today been forced to take a bit of a hit today after the publication of a ‘zoo magazine’ on the front page of newspapers across the country.

This comes as a report has found that the Australian print media landscape has been littered with the likes of a zoo magazine, as well as the likes of the Sydney Morning Herald, The Sydney Advocate, The Daily Telegraph and The Daily Telegraph.

The report has found that there has been a spike in zoo magazines being distributed on the front pages of newspapers, with many newspapers reporting that circulation has increased by 50% since the launch of the ‘zoo magazine’ in 2009.

The report found that the circulation of zoo magazines increased dramatically after the first issue was released in 2009, and has since then, become a veritable industry bible.

However, a number of leading newspapers have today come out and said that they are not content with just one issue.

“We’ve seen this before with other things,” said one Sydney Morning Herald journalist.

“The internet has made it easy for people to take advantage of. They’re still paying for the privilege to get online,”

“It’s a slippery slope that goes all the way to the wrong side,”

“It seems the prime minister is playing catch up,”

“I mean, we don’t want to be left to have to pay for something we’ve already got.”

West End Man Still Struggling To Find What He Used To Be In The Eighties

A local West End man who spent his early teenage years in the eighties has today revealed that he still struggles to find his way in the world.

The young man, who hasn’t had a drink in nearly three decades, explained that his childhood was a tough time in which to live.

“It was a time when my parents were still trying to make ends meet” he said.

“A time when I was trying to find a way to make ends meet and live a life that wasn’t defined by the state that I lived in at the time”

“That’s why I still struggle to find my way, it’s a struggle that I’m still trying to overcome”

The young man went on to explain that the period in his life that he spent ‘not doing drugs’ was a time in which he was exposed to a lot of ‘hype’ and ‘jock culture’ – as well as a certain amount of ‘stereotypes’.

“That’s why I still struggle to find my way in the world, even though I know I’m definitely not a ‘cunt’’ or a ‘pedo’” he said.

“It was a time when you were either a boy or a girl. Which was your childhood, it was a time when you were either the most ‘diverse’ or the most ‘white’ person”

“I guess I’m still trying to find my way in the world, even though I know I’m definitely not a ‘white cunt’ or a ‘pedo”

The young man then went on to explain that he had never really experienced ‘the real world’ and that he didn’t know what it felt like to be a ‘white cunt’ or a ‘pedo’.

“It’s like a strange place, you know?”

“There was a time when I was the most ‘white’ person in the world, now I’m the most ‘white person in the world’”

Melbourne Man Still Not Sure Why He Left Melbourne After Leaving Melbourne

A Melbourne man who’s been in the city for a number of years says he’s never really felt at home.

At least not the way he thinks he does.

While speaking to The Advocate this morning via telephone, Ben Hastings said he’s never really felt at home in Melbourne.

“There’s just something about the city,” he said.

“Something about the place. I guess you could say it’s a bit of a Melbourne thing,”

“The whole ambience, the culture, everything is a bit different to the city. There’s just something about the place that’s missing in most of the country. Like a distinct lack of hipsters and hipsters who don’t look like them. That’s the vibe I guess. It’s hard to explain it, it’s just a really nice place to visit but I guess I just don’t get it.”

Hastings explained that he’s been in Melbourne for a number of years and he’s never really felt at home.

“I’ve been to some nice places in the state capitals and they just seem to be full of people who don’t know what they are doing. Like they don’t really know what they are doing. Like they’re full of people who don’t know what city they are in,”

“So I guess I’ve just never really felt at home.”

NRL Player Named ‘Scum Kunt’ After Club Tops Up To Zero

TEXT:

A man who plays rugby league football for the Sydney Roosters, has today been labelled as ‘a bit of a bum’ by his club after the club decided to offer him a new contract.

“We don’t have a choice,” said the man. “We’re losing the next two years of our careers for nothing.”

“We’re out of options. We’re getting a new coach and a new physio. We’re also in talks with the NRL about a potential sponsorship deal. They’re behind it,”

The man, who is currently playing a season-long ban for striking a fan in the neck during the club’s pre-season, explained that he’s tired of being treated like a second-class citizen by the Rugby League club that he’s always looked up to as a role model.

“They’re just a bit of piss on the wall, mate. They’re just a bit of pig-headed cuntfuck to keep running with the ball and throw it in,” he said.

“Fuck the NRL for making me a scapegoat for their own failings and flaws.”

The man, who is also an aspiring rugby league player, said that he’s looking for a club that he can play for and that he can play for a long time.

“It’s not like they’ve got to offer me a new contract. It’s just, I want to play for a club that I love,” the man said.

The man then went on to explain that he was a bit confused by the club’s offer, saying that they don’t seem to know who he is or what he does.

“So I guess they’re just a bit confused by my love of rugby league football,” he said.

“The other day I was trying to get a few mates to come and watch the Roosters play against the Manly Magpies. We’ve got a real club like the Roosters, a real club. They couldn’t get us a ticket, but they didn’t think they’d have to pay for a two hour experience,”

“It’s a bit of a good time to be a bum.”

Bill Shorten To Be Named The Australian Of The Year After Australian Barbecue Industry Sees Bigger Boom In 2018

TEXT:

Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is today making a bold declaration to the Australian barbecue community.

He’s doing it after the big numbers have come in for the 2018 Australian barbecue industry, which is now at its peak.

Speaking today at the National barbecue and meat show, Mr Turnbull says he’s just ‘felt it’ and has decided to name the industry after a small country town in the New South Wales north coast.

“The Australian Barbecue Industry is the industry of choice for the majority of our country’s population,” he said.

“That’s why I named it the Australian of the Year, after a town that actually has a barbeque industry,”

“We need to have a look at this industry, we need to make it big in Australia.”

The Prime Minister’s comments come as the industry is having a hard time coping with the plummeting meat prices and an increasingly dangerous climate change policy that many of them feel is unjust.

“That way, it’ll be my dog for a long time to come.”

Man Who Says He’s Always Had A Laptop But Always Woke Up In The Morning To Check Emails

Just over a year ago, Mark Colwell-Jones was still in the same job as a copywriter at Bell Potter’s Betoota offices in Betoota Grove.

He was the only male on the team – which was still struggling with the rampant gender inequality that was sweeping the office.

He was also the only white male – he was a white male who had never had a laptop – ever.

But that was then, and this is now.

Mark has taken time out of his busy morning of doing fuck all to speak to The Advocate about the challenges of being a white male in the digital world.

“I just had a laptop, but it’s been a while since I used it,” he said.

“When I was younger, I used to have hours at a time. I’d only have one or two. Now, I have more than enough time to do anything,”

“I used to have an office gym with a computer in it so I could walk around the block and play with my Xbox One when I wanted to, but I’ve stopped doing that. I’m the only white male at Bell Potter, so I need to be the only one doing it. I’m the only one who makes a point of it. It’s tough.”

Mark then explained that he’s had to constantly be reminded that he doesn’t have time to do things like go to the gym or go to the pub with the girls.

“I’m trying to make it work now.” he said.

“I’ve got to keep moving forward.”

Australia’s Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce Reaches Out To The Australian Public To Find A Way Out Of This Mess

TEXT:

The Deputy Prime Minister has reached out to the Australian public in a desperate search for a way out of this week’s standoff with the North Queensland Cowboys.

Barnaby Joyce’s attempts at using the powers of the state’s legislature to resolve the issue have failed, leading the nation’s media to speculate that he may be planning to take matters into his own hands.

A number of prominent figures have come forward to say that Barnaby may be using his powers of the state to take matters into his own hands, using the power of the state to make sure the Cowboys don’t win the premiership, as well as to ensure the Nationals don’t win an election they’re not allowed to have in Queensland.

Speaking to the media today, Mr Joyce said that he’s not going to waste time and he’s going to find a way out of this mess.

“The best way to resolve this situation is for the two sides to meet in private, at the table, with an open mind and a desire to create a better understanding,” said Joyce.

“We’ve made a public declaration that we’re going to resolve this mess, I’m happy to do that if it means we can get a better understanding of the other side,”

“But I won’t let a private meeting or meeting between the two of them ruin our ability to do that.”

The Nationals leader then went on to explain that he’s already made contact with the two people on the receiving end of this mess, and that he’s already been in touch with the people in the state where the meeting took place.

“It’s like, the people of Queensland. The people of Queensland have always been a bit loathsome. The Queensland people are like a loathsome bunch of blue collar sheep. They are hard working and proud of who they are. They are also a bit loathsome,”

“But I’ll be happy to work with them if they can get a better understanding of the other side of this mess, because I’m not too keen on the Cowboys winning this year”

Anarchist’s War On Commercialism On Hold As A New Government Gives Him Dream Of A Free Country

TEXT:

The prospect of having the Australian parliament and federal government stripped of their powers to legislate on the things that they are powerless to do under the current constitution is one that young Albert Smith has been able to put aside for the time being.

The 23-year-old student at Betoota’s prestigious Royal College of the Hardwick told The Advocate this morning that he’s looking forward to a time when he has complete power over his body and mind.

“I mean, I’m not going to take the piss. I’m not going to join the army or be a police officer, I’m going to become an anarchist,” he said.

“But I’m a republican and I’m ready to start thinking for a little bit of time,” he explained.

“So I’m just waiting for the government to give me the ability to live a life that is totally free. Like when they give me the ability to decide how to live, how to invest, how to spend my money,” he said.

“I’m not ready to be a millionaire just yet, that’s a lot of responsibility to shoulder. But I’m going to be an anarchist one day.”

The degree is also expected to give him the ability to live like a king, which is a nice touch.

“I’m just waiting for the right moment, like the right time to start thinking about being the king of the whole fucking place,” he said.

“But I’ll let you know.”

Study Confirms What Every Bachelor On The Planet Says: Girls Don’t Like It

TEXT:

A recent study conducted by the CSIRO has confirmed what every male on the planet says.

The study found that girls don’t like it.

The CSIRO said the data was collected in more than 20 different countries and territories and used to compile the most comprehensive study ever conducted into the female-specific reasons for not liking it.

Lead researcher, Professor Mark Horton, explained that the CSIRO wanted to create a comprehensive study into the reasons why the female earth does not like certain things.

“We wanted to find out why girls are generally not very good at sports, and why they enjoy less life experience than males,” he said.

“We found that the most common reason girls don’t like it is because it’s cheap.”

“At the end of the day, the CSIRO would like to suggest that you can get it for a lot less than what you paid for it,” he said.

“And we’d also like to suggest that you should leave the CSIRO and find something else to do, like the NRL,”

“We’re not saying that you should retire, or that you shouldn’t even go to the NRL, but it’s hard to get a job at a big company, you know?”

Horton then explained that the CSIRO has advised that you should go to the beach and swim in the wildest parts of the world, but that’s not for fun.

“But you can do it if you want,” he said.

“You can do it if you want, but if you want, you’ll be better than the other blokes on the planet if you go to the beaches of Cabo, or the Cunnamulla beach, or wherever it is you’ve been.”

Local Woman Conquests Spirit By Going To Parties With Her Husband

TEXT:

Local woman, Deidre ‘Deejay’ Henderson has used her husband’s experiences as a party host to convince herself that she is an equal.

This has not been easy, especially as her husband is a senior member of the local police.

“I thought I was being a bit silly. But then I realised that it’s not just him. It’s all the kids too,”

“I’m not trying to be the best person in the world. I’m just trying to be the best person for my partner, who I think is the most important person in the world,”

This kind of acceptance comes as a surprise to many people, as her husband, Ben Henderson, says he can’t understand how she does it.

“I just think it’s so simple. She is just so good at it. I think she’s just very gifted,”

“I’m not sure if it’s the reality TV stuff, but I’m sure she’s been doing it for years,”

“It’s really hard to be a woman at a party. You can get so caught up in the moments of high drama,”

“She has just never been a party person.”

When asked to elaborate on her comments, Deidre said she was just trying to be a good person, and that her husband Ben is simply ‘a normal person’.

“I’m sure he’s done it before, but it’s hard to tell, you know?”

“He’s just a normal person.”

Brisbane Plays A Big Game Of Rugby To End The Old Quarter And Get A New Bridge

TEXT:

The city’s politicians, including the odd couple from the New England, have worked hard to get this city a new bridge.

The City of Brisbane has been getting a new bridge every six months for the past few years, but that’s about to change.

After some thought, the River City’s politicians decided to play a bit of rugby, with their new bridge every six months.

The new bridge is set to be a $1.2 billion project, and is set to replace the ageing bridge at the North Brisbane/North Queensferry intersection.

This new bridge will be a big win for the city’s politicians, who’ll be able to use it to cut through busy traffic and cut down the need for a car-centric city like Brisbane.

The new bridge will also be a great way to get around the city, since the existing bridge is only used by buses and trams.

The popular young woman, who hasn’t given up on her dream of going to university, told The Advocate that she just cannot seem to get it back.

“It’s just impossible,” she said.

“It’s like, it’s been ages since I lost my key, it’s like, it was a year’s pass, but it’s just gone.”

“I’m trying to get it back and everything, but it’s just so hard. Like, I’ve been trying to find it for like a year and now it’s just gone. It’s just not possible,”

“I’ve had like three different locks just snapped in the last few weeks.”

The woman said she was also trying to get her keys back but said it’s ‘kind of like a year’s pass, so she’s not sure how much longer she can afford to keep going without them.

“It’s like, you know, it’s like, one of those things. You go through it and then you come back and find the key in the kitchen cupboard, but you’re not even sure where it’s at,” she said.

Mum Looking Good, But Not Good Enough

The mother of three has today been told that she is looking good but not good enough, and that she needs to be a bit more polished.

The mother of three, Shona (48), says she has always been a bit slow on the uptake, but as her children get older, she starts to notice that she doesn’t really care about what they wear, or how they act.

“I don’t know, I’ve always been pretty much the same as them” she says.

“Maybe I’ve gotten a bit old for my age, or maybe I’ve gotten a bit of a sickly pallor, but I don’t know”

“They are pretty much just like me, they just look better and act a bit better, but they are still looking pretty damn good!”

“I mean, I don’t really see any distinguishing signs”

“They are just looking pretty good, but I’m not that type of woman”

It’s believed that Shona’s oldest child, Tania (16), also has a fair idea of how to deal with her mother, but is hesitant at first because she has a father who doesn’t really talk to her, and a male stepfather who is just a little bit mean to her.

“Mum, you are looking pretty good” says Tania, in a desperate attempt at not being seen to looking good.

“I’m pretty sure you are looking pretty good”

“I’m sorry I can’t tell you”

The popular account coordinator at a local boutique agency in Betoota’s Old City District spoke to The Advocate a short time ago about her recent days at home with the kids.

“It’s not ideal,” said Jenny, who’s been here for a little bit longer than usual, meaning she’s getting old.

“But I’m getting old, too. I’m getting old because I’m tired of being the only one who can wait until Sunday morning to get everything done. Everything from the house, to the car, to the car’s errata,”

Turnbull Says His Future Is Now Clear After A Few Days In The Hamptons

TEXT:

The Prime Minister has been given the opportunity to start again after a few weeks in the country’s southern seaboard – by the arrival of his first family in town.

This comes after Malcolm Turnbull has been given the opportunity to start again after a few weeks in the country’s southern seaboard – by the arrival of his first family in town.

After a few weeks on the campaign trail, the Prime Minister has had the opportunity to reassess his position on a number of key issues that he used to hold dear, and is now in a better position to move forward.

“It’s just great,” said the Member for Warringah.

“I’ve been on the campaign for a couple months now, and I’ve had the opportunity to reassess my position on a number of key issues that I used to hold dear, and is now in a better position to move forward.”

“I think it’s great that I have the luxury of doing that. It means I don’t have to spend time and energy campaigning on issues that really matter to people, like climate change and the future of the nation. It’s a great relief for me,”

“So I’ve decided to start again, and I’ll be doing it with a lot of family and close friends in the next couple of weeks, so I can see if I can get a few more votes up to make it to the next election.”

The Prime Minister then explained that he was going to go down to the Northern Beaches and see if he can meet with the old boys to talk about issues that really matter to young people, like a car that can go from zero to 60 in just 5 seconds, or the Prime Minister’s time in the Hamptons after he left the club for a night on the tiles with the girl from work.

“I’ll have a few drinks with the boys and see if I can get a few more votes up to win the next election,” he said.

“I’ll probably be able to pull a few chicks out of the woods and put them in the car on a windy day, and drive them down to a nice place and have a few drinks with the old boys. It’s just so good to have these things that matter,”

“And I’ll have a bit of a go at the pub too, just to see how I go.”

More to come.

“Do You Really Want To Know What My Name Is?” Asks Teenage Girl From Headphones

TEXT:

A local 15-year-old girl has today been asked to describe her name to an adult, in a neutral manner, in a social situation, so as to avoid the ambiguity of her name.

The girl was approached by a friend, who is a person who is a bit of a mystery to her, as she has not yet given her parents her full name.

This is the third time this year the girl has been asked to describe her name to an adult, in a way that makes it clear that she is not a girl.

The previous instances happened when she was asked to describe her name to a friend at a picnic, and the previous time she was asked to describe her name to a babysitter.

However, this time around she is being asked to describe her name to a random adult who isn’t her parent, or a random adult she doesn’t know.

“Um, my name is Emily, my parents call me. Mum uses it, but Dad uses it and my mother, you know, she’s a pretty simple woman,” said the girl as her parent smiled at the awkwardness.

“I guess it’s just a bit hard to pronounce, I don’t really know my own name, I’m just using my parents name. I don’t know how anyone can be confused by that.”

Her parents smiled back and told her to shut up, and leave.

NRL Player Who Left Two-Fingers On iPhone Not Scared Of Electronic Arts

A young man who left two-finger scuffed on his iPhone 4S has said he’s not scared of EA Sports, and that he’s not going to give up.

The young man, who asked to remain anonymous, told The Advocate this morning that he’s been playing Madden since he was a kid and always dreamed of getting a pair of EA Sports shoes.

He spoke to our reporter a short time ago via telephone where he explained that he’s been playing an awful lot of Madden over the last few years.

“I’ve got EA SPORTS,” he said.

“That game is so fun. But I’ve got a feeling it’s not the same as the games you get with your phone nowadays,”

“I mean, I love EA SPORTS, but I don’t think it’s worth playing if you’ve got a phone like mine. It’s a bit like a Mario game in some ways, but a bit more hardcore. I’ve got EA SPORTS Off, but I’m not scared of it. Like, I’m not scared of the game.”

The Advocate reached out to EA Sports for comment but have yet to receive a reply.

However, a number of people at the company were able to confirm to our reporter that they’re not scared of the game at all.

One of those people was a senior executive at the company, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

“We don’t scare people,” he said.

“We’re just a company of men and women who love playing games and creating games. We don’t make games, we make games to entertain people. It’s just that, sometimes we make games that are a bit darker than what they’d be playing on a normal phone. That’s the industry we live in.”

“The bottom line is, we don’t scare people in the slightest.”

Local Woman’s Big Night On The Drinks With Her Dad Is Taken By A Bad Boy

A local woman, who was drunk enough to pass out on the couch with her dad, has had a big night on the drinks with her dad.

It’s believed the man in question, John Singleton (62), had been drinking with his wife and was going to ask her to come and join him for a few drinks, but he was just too drunk to keep talking to himself.

“So I went up to the house and had a couple with my wife and sat down with a few friends at the bar and just got a couple with my wife,” he said.

“Then I just thought, ‘fuck it,’ and drank with my wife and her friends,’ and then I thought about it,”

“I had a couple with my daughter, a couple with my son and I sat down with some friends and a couple with some of the old boys,”

“It was a good night.”

The Advocate caught up with the woman’s eldest daughter, Sarah, to hear how she was feeling about having her dad drinking with her old friends.

“I’m happy for him to have his daughter but it’s just not up to snuff. He’s a bad boy and I think he’s going to do it to himself,”

Our reporter also spoke to the dad’s son, who is now in charge of Sarah’s nightlife.

“The Liberal Party has always been about doing more to help the poor, and that’s what we’re doing.”

Just weeks after the release of Big Bang, the film’s lead actor and lead songwriter, John Candy has today offered a bold and uncompromising assessment of the current state of music journalism.

“I know what you’re thinking, you big-headed cunts. I’m not listening to you.”

The film’s lead single, ‘I Don’t Like,’ is a blistering critique of the current state of Australian music journalism. The film’s producers have made it clear that the song has nothing whatsoever to do with the current state of Australian music journalism.

“This song is about something bigger than us. It’s about the culture industry, it’s about the way the press writes music reviews. It’s about the whole thing.”

Candy went on to explain that the song is about something bigger than he, personally, but the other members of his band are not sure about.

“We don’t even know what the fuck this song is about. I mean, it’s so obvious it’s been written about it. But it’s the most obvious critique of the current state of Australian music journalism, you know what I mean?”

“You’re probably thinking that I’m being a bit old-fashioned here. That’s a fair criticism. But it’s not fair, because I think this song is about something bigger than me.”

Candy then went on to explain that he has been in contact with the other members of his band and has promised to provide a comment before the song’s release.

Elderly Woman Excited To Experience Life As A Single-Sex Home With No Children

A 62-year-old woman who’s decided to live like she’s in her late forties, with a family and a decent future, says she’s excited to live her life as a single-sex home with no children.

“I’ve got a great future,” said the single-sex home owner.

“I’m not worried about being around the kids. I don’t want to raise them to be the best version of themselves. But yeah, they’d be in better health if they didn’t have to be in the workforce.”

The single-sex home is located in a quiet cul-de-sac in the leafy cul-de-sac just north of the city of Sydney’s Point Street, just steps from the city.

“It’s a beautiful place,” she said.

“It’s where I want to be.”

Unemployed Man Not Sure How To Give A Fuck About The NBN

TEXT:

A local unemployed man has been left scratching his head after watching the 7:30 Report last night.

The program, hosted by the BBC and ABC, was broadcast last night from a BBC studio in London, and features interviews with people who are either unemployed, or on the dole, or both.

The show has generated a lot of interest in the local unemployed man, who has been left scratching his head after watching last night’s program.

The man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told The Advocate that he’s been watching the show for months, but just can’t get into the program without being reminded of the fact that he’s not getting a real job.

“I dunno, I just don’t get it,” he said.

“The NBN is the most important thing for the country. It’s the future of the nation. It’s the future of the planet,”

“But most of the time, I don’t get a real job. I just keep trying to get a real job but I get nothing. So, yeah, I’m not sure how to give a fuck about it, you know what I mean?”

“I’m just a local unemployed man who’s been watching 7:30 Report for months on end, and just can’t get a real job. You know, a job that pays enough to live a decent life, and at the same time, is reasonably easy. You know what I mean?”

The Advocate reached out to the BBC for comment but have yet to receive a reply.

New Study Concludes Girls Need To Get More Realistic About Their Dating Habits

TEXT:

A recent report by the CSIRO has found that girls need to be a bit more realistic about their dating habits, and start showing more empathy towards men, to get more of a connection with them.

The study, which was based on over 20,000 young Australian adults, found that girls are often oblivious to the fact that they are completely unrealistic about their chances of getting a relationship with a guy that is emotionally invested in them, and completely oblivious to the fact that they are completely unrealistic about the chances of a guy getting a relationship with them.

“This is a really big problem,” said one CSIRO researcher.

“Girls need to stop being so realistic about their chances of getting a relationship with a guy. You know, it’s not just the fact that they are unable to date guys that they’ve already met in person, but also the fact that they are so unrealistic about the guy they are dating,”

“It’s not that they don’t want a relationship, it’s just that they’re not ready for one.”

The CSIRO researcher explained that the reason girls are so unrealistic about their chances of getting a relationship with a guy is because they are so invested in him that they don’t want to see him again and again.

“The same goes with the girls, they just need to get a bit more realistic about their chances of getting a relationship with a guy,” the CSIRO researcher said.

“They’re not that unrealistic about him because they don’t want a relationship, they’re so invested in him that they don’t want to see him again and again,”

“We just need to make it real for them, so they don’t get so caught up in the moment that they forget that they’re not ready for a relationship.”

Ex-Gay Christians Pushing Back Against The Gay-Marriage Lobby With Strong, No-Discrimination Religious-Policy

TEXT:

A group of ex-gay Christians have today announced their strong support for the traditional definition of marriage, in a meeting with a leading Australian Christian lobby group, the Australian Christian Lobby.

The group, which includes a number of prominent ex-gay figures, are calling for a constitutional amendment to allow for a gay marriage.

This comes as the Australian Christian Lobby receives a lot of heat from the public over their strong stance against gay marriage, and their close relationship with both the state and federal governments.

A number of ex-gay people, who haven’t found a home in the gay community, have taken the opportunity to push back against the pressure from the homosexual community to be in the LGBTI community.

This has resulted in a meeting between some ex-gay people, and the Australian Christian Lobby.

In the meeting, the ex-gay people call for a constitutional amendment to allow for gay marriage, and for the right of ex-gay people to continue to be ex-gay.

“It’s time to let the gays know that they are not alone” said one ex-gay person, who didn’t find himself a home in the gay community.

“We are not alone”

“We have a voice, and we are the only ones who has a chance at winning this battle”

“Please, help us win”

A local father of three says he’s just made a phone call to ask if you’ve ever heard of the ‘Frozen’ franchise, after watching the latest instalment in the franchise.

“Yeah, I think I’ve made a phone call to every family in the pub and everyone’s been really keen to know if I’ve ever heard of this movie,” said the father, who asked to remain anonymous.

“So yeah, I rang every bloke in the pub and told them I had heard of it, and they all thought it was a bit weird that I’d made a phone call,”

“But yeah, I think they’re onto something here. I rang every bloke in the pub and told them I had heard of it but they all thought it was a bit weird that I’d made a phone call.”

The father’s eldest son, George, said he’s not too keen on the idea, despite being indirectly responsible for it.

“I don’t mind if you have,” he said.

“But you don’t need to have it if it’s got a kid in it. I don’t mind if it’s got a mum in it, but you can’t have it if it’s got a dad in it,”

“This is a movie about three people who go on a journey to save the world from the worst things that the world has to offer.”

NRL Player’s Super Rugby Career Under Threat Of Not Playing Enough Rugby After Being Forced To Play Bunnies

A local rugby league player has had his Super Rugby contract terminated this week after being told he won’t be playing any more Rugby League matches for the foreseeable future.

“That’s all. Bunnies, Super Rugby and all that rugby crap. It’s all rugby now. It’s all rugby for me,”

“But I guess the NRL is a bit more of a rough house than Rugby League. They don’t really kick on as hard as the Rugby League. I mean, they’ve kicked the shit at me once but. It’s not like I’m about to kick the bucket on a flight to the mainland. I’m still playing for my old club.”

The player’s manager confirmed that the player is set to be released from the Rabbitohs after the season, but the club won’t be getting the player until at least the end of next year.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison Says It’s Time To Take The Climate Change Conspiracy Seriously

TEXT:

The Prime Minister has made a point of not talking about climate change since his very first day on the job, and has vowed to take the issue off the front pages of newspapers and television shows to focus on the facts.

That has led to a lot of hand wringing amongst his own party and the nation at large, with a number of scientists and economists telling The Advocate that the Prime Minister is off his fucking head.

“He’s gone and said climate change is a hoax and a clear conflict of interest,” said one senior scientist.

“There’s a very high level of scepticism that the Prime Minister has taken on board. I mean, I’m not one of those fuckwit baby boomers who think climate change is real,”

“But he’s had to deal with a lot of the same old same old same old shit over the last few months. This is the first time I’m seeing the Prime Minister actually take the issue seriously.”

However, the Prime Minister was not having it.

“Yeah look, I don’t know what he’s talking about,” said one science person.

“He’s taken the side of the coalition for the better part of the last decade or so. I mean, it’s a fair bet that most people in the Coalition would have voted for the Coalition government if Tony Abbott was still in the leadership,”

“But he’s fucked this one. This is a real blow for him. He’s gone and said climate change is a hoax. So, yeah, that’s the one.”

Man Who Used To ‘Tally Up’ His Laptop’s Weight Has Told His Mother He’s Not Ready For The Gym

TEXT:

A local father of three has told his mother this morning that he’s not ready for the gym.

The Betoota Grove Retirement community has been a hub for many local men and women, but it seems most of them have become weary of it all.

John Greenholm, a 57-year-old father of three, told The Advocate that he’s spent the last few years having a hard time trying to motivate himself to get his work in.

“I used to be able to get up and do the squats in the morning,” he said.

“Now I’m at the gym three times a week and I’m getting sick of it. I’ve got a new computer, a new monitor and a new phone. It’s not easy, I guess,”

“But I’ve been able to cut down on the hours I’ve spent at the gym. When I was a young fella, I used to come home and beat the shit out of a few Chinese ladies on the way to the gym. Then I’d get out and do the lunges, which I still do every day. Then I’d run the triathlons. I’ve also been able to get my weight up by a couple kilos. So yeah, I’m a little bit sick of the gym,”

“But it’s not my fault.”

The Betoota Grove Retirement community is nestled in the leafy, leafy, leafy part of Betoota’s northern outskirts. It’s on the edge of the Simpson Desert, just a short drive north of the city of Betoota Heights.

It’s a leafy, leafy, suburb with a population of just under a million.

There’s no shopping or nightlife in the retirement community, which is also known as the leafy, leafy, suburb that is Betoota Grove.

The only other residents are a prominent publican and a young professional cyclist.

“Oi, Why Do We Have To Talk About This Shit?” Says Man Who’s Had A Few

A local dad who’s had a few hot chicks has decided to take a swing at a particular minority of society that he’s never met.

The man named James Green, who has only had a few hot chicks in his life, told The Advocate that he’s decided to take it upon himself to say something because he’s noticed that people are starting to talk about this shit over the last few months.

“Yeah, I know it’s a bit hypocritical for me to be talking about this shit, but I’m just having a few hot chicks in my life and the only thing I’m doing is talking about it,” he said.

“That’s the only thing.”

The 57-year-old father of three then proceeded to tell our reporter that he’s never had a problem with the idea of having a few hot chicks in his life, ever.

“You know what, I’ve had a few hot chicks in the last three years,” he said.

“It’s just that, they’re not a minority and they’re not a minority of any demographic, they’re just hot chicks. So why the hell do I need to talk about this shit?”

“I’m just having a few hot chicks, that’s all.”

Our reporter reached out to the local Betoota Heights police station for comment and received a prompt reply.

“You have a hot chick in your life, whether it’s your mother or your girlfriend,” said Sergeant Mick Finn.

“It’s just a matter of time until they start popping a few down in the Betoota Heights area. You never know.”

Turnbull Urged To Put A Stop To The Unnecessary Snares And Shoot The Shittest Fucking Pointers In The House

TEXT:

The Prime Minister has today been urged to stop the unnecessary snares and shoot the fucking ones that fuck the ball.

This comes as the PM is under fire for the controversial decision to close down the parliament.

The snares, which have been pointed out by the Opposition and Opposition leader Bill Shorten as being the reason why the parliament is not even open, are the symbol of the Turnbull government.

“I just can’t believe they keep closing down parliament,”

“I’ve called for them to be shot and I’m calling for them to be put to sleep,”

“It’s not worth it,”

The Prime Minister’s most recent controversial decision comes after a two-week-long consultation on the controversial legislation to close down parliament.

The proposed laws would effectively abolish the parliament, the nation’s parliament, and the House of Representatives, and replace it with a more like a presidential style senate with a less transparent structure, and fewer elected officials.

The laws are due to be passed by the end of the week and will then be passed by the upper house, the second-oldest institution in the Australian parliament.

Man Who Has Never Gotten A State Government job Asked If He’s Worked In The Past

The interview took place in the office of a boutique advertising agency where the man, who has never gone through any form of government job, was assigned the role of the ‘reporter’.

The conversation, which was seemingly innocuous enough, took a turn when the subject ‘wasn’t able to give his name or anything like that.

“I don’t know why he didn’t just say his name or something like that,” said the friend.

“I just asked him if he’s ever worked for the government and he said no. He said he’s never worked in any capacity. He’s just a contractor.”

The Advocate reached out to the office of Mr Boyd and Mr Farned about the interview and received a short reply.

“Do You Really Want To See My Neck?” Asks Nation’s Youngest

TEXT:

While the rest of the nation slowly comes to terms with the fact that they now have a Prime Minister who wears a necktie, Australians 25-44 are still not.

The nation’s most promising young people, according to The Advocate, are the only demographic that actually care about the politics that surrounds them.

With the exception of a few high-profile young people who are either private school dipshit losers or the offspring of wealthy and successful public servants, the nation’s youngest people are the only demographic that actually care about what happens to you if you die of natural causes.

This comes after the nation’s most promising young people have made it clear that they don’t want to see you wearing a necktie to work every day.

“Do you really want to see my neck?” asks one young woman, Sarah, who was only the third person in her family to graduate.

“I don’t even get why people like you wear it. It’s a nice piece of neck jewelry,” she says.

Local Man’s Mates Now All That Real Estate Has To Do With His Noodle

TEXT:

Sitting at his desk this morning, a young local man found himself chomping at the bit to get a bit of a closer look at a small, but essential, element in the local landscape.

Turning his head to look, he was immediately greeted by a sea of blue and a pleasant smile from a number of his friends.

“We’re getting a bit of a rattle up here,” said the young man.

“We’re all for a bit of razzmatazz, I guess. But you can’t have a good razzmatazz without a good kitchen”

“And a good kitchen without a good dining room. A good dining room without a good dining table. A good dining room without a good kitchen.”

The young man then looked up to see his mate’s eyes glazing over and a big smile creeping on across his face.

He knew he was doing something right, but still, he needed to try it for the love of the game.

“Hey, what’s your name again?” said the young man.

“I’m Sam, you know who I am.”

Sam smiled back.

“Yeah, I know. Sam, you’re a real beauty,” said Sam.

“I really like your clothes, too,” said Sam.

“Oh?”

Sam shrugged.

“Yeah, just like my own,” said Sam.

“I’ve got some nice things in my own wardrobe,” said Sam.

Sam looked up at the woman next to him and smiled back.

“You know what they say about the real estate?”

“Yeah, just like my own,” said Sam.

“I don’t get it. It’s just like my own. They say you need to be able to walk through a supermarket without having to pay. I’m a real estate person, not a bank person.”

Sam nodded.

“I think you’re right.”

Local man loves a few kava trips, too

TEXT:

Logan Michael Murchison is one of thousands of young Australians who enjoy a few kava trips each year – but he’s not alone.

“It’s just great fun,” said the 26-year-old financial advisor.

“But I guess you could be in for a shock when the time comes to really dive in. I mean, I’m not that brave,”

“But I’m not afraid of the unknown either. I’m just afraid of missing out.”

That’s why the Betoota local is a big fan of kava trips, too.

Like most, he’s been to several kava festivals over the years.

But the one he’s most excited about is the Betoota Pacific Islands Kava Festival in Momba this October.

“I’ve been to many of the islands,” he said.

“But Momba is a real stand out, it’s got real kava and everything. I’ll be there if I miss out on this,”

“Plus, I’m the only one here in the whole big city, so I’m the only one getting a real kick out of the place. I’m a real kava man.”

“It’s Like I’m Walking Into Someone’s Mind” Says Brisbane Boomer Who’s Never Had To Work Outside

TEXT:

A prominent Brisbane father of three, who’s never had to work outside the city, has today told The Advocate that Brisbane is ‘a bit different’ and that he can’t imagine working anywhere else in the country.

“It’s a bit like New York” he said.

“You have these cool things like the beach and all these cool things like the river”

“But, you know, you’ve gotta love it here. It’s like I’m walking into someone’s mind”

The 35-year-old father of three, who also happens to be one of the most influential figures in his town’s progressive elite – says he’s never had to ‘work in the city’ – but he has been lucky enough to get his hands on a Bachelor in Paradise ticket – and he’s seen the city for what it’s actually like.

“It’s just a bit different” he said.

“Like, you know, I’ve never actually worked in a office. But yeah, it’s a bit different”

“Like, it’s just like New York, but a bit more isolated. Like you’ve gotta love it here”

“Like, you have to love it here”

However, one local city worker has slammed the former Gold Coast youth-orientated official for not ‘being able to see the big picture’ in the city.

“I mean, it’s true. Brisbane is a pretty ordinary place. It’s a bit like New York. I mean, it’s not like they’ve got the same type of people who live in New York, but still. I mean, they’ve got this type of people, but they don’t call them New York people”

“Like, they’re just as likely to be from the Bronx as the rest of the city. Like they’re just the type of people who live in a city. Like they’re just the type of people who work in a city”

After a 4-month-old baby left in the Virgin Mary’s arms yesterday, local father of three, John Parkes says he doesn’t really remember much but he definitely feels a connection to it.

The 56-year-old says that he’s been holding onto the Virgin Mary for years, as a way of making peace with his troubled past.

“It’s just a bit of magic” he said.

“I just don’t really remember, it was about a boy. My wife says I’m holding onto him as a baby, but I don’t really remember. But then again, I’ve got the old Madonna in my heart,”

“Anyway, it’s all about the Virgin Mary.”

The Advocate reached out to the Catholic Church for comment but they told us that they’d be open to them being involved in the situation.

“We don’t have to comment on a matter before the courts,” said the Rev. Mark Di Stefano, of the South Betoota Catholic Church.

“But I can tell you that John was a big supporter of the idea of having a child taken from his hands at the age of two.”

“I mean, I’m really getting into this car and I’m having a really hard time remembering the keys.” 

It’s believed the owner left the key in the ignition to avoid having to open the vehicle and take the keys out.

This comes as the young man tries to ignore the constant stream of elderly women coming into his mate’s place and asking him to ‘just leave it be’.

Jordan says he has to work hard on not driving while distracted.

“I just try and not think about it” he says.

Jordan says that he’s never really thought about the possibility of getting caught on a bike before.

“I guess it’s the last thing I’ll ever have to do.”

Jordan says it’s not just his own personal safety that he’s worried about, but also the safety of other people he’s not going to see again, and is concerned about the safety of other young people who are at risk of being killed by a drunk cyclist.

“I mean, I’m not too worried about the young people who get out of their cars and risk their lives to get a bit of a tan” he says.

A new report by the CSIRO has found that every single party of war and terrorist terror that has ever existed, has been in the majority of people who actually go to pubs.

The CSIRO report, Terrorists, Terrorists, Party Of War And Terrorists, found that of the 180,000+ party-of-war and terrorist terrorist terrorists that have ever existed, almost all of them were in the majority of people who actually go to pubs.

“It’s pretty clear that every single one of them is in the majority of people who actually go to pubs” said one CSIRO researcher.

The young woman behind the bold marketing campaign that has seen the app go from strength to strength, says she’s been trying to get people to listen to her about her love for headphones for weeks, but has had little luck.

“I mean, it’s true, I was literally the first one in line to buy them. But it’s just that, I never got round to it,” said Anna.

“It’s just like the old saying, if you can’t listen to your own heartbeat, then you shouldn’t be playing games of chance,” she said.

“You know what? I don’t care if I don’t have a pulse because I’m playing with my headphones in. I’m playing with my headphones in,”

The Advocate reached out to a number of other local women, who told us that while they love hearing Anna’s story, they also feel that they’re not actually capable of doing it themselves.

One local woman, who asked to remain anonymous, said that she often finds herself in situations where she’s just flat out outnumbered, so she’s forced to rely on her friends.

Dangerous Levels Of Synthetic Bisphenol A Found In Local Baby Formula Found In Local Baby Formula

TEXT:

The Australian Consumer Product Safety Commission has today found that Bisphenol A, the active ingredient in baby formula made famous by the popular TV show, Bongo, has been found to be present in some local baby formula.

The CSIRO has spent close to a year investigating the exact composition of the chemical, which ultimately lead them to conclude that the substance is probably Bisphenol A (BPA).

The CSIRO says that while they didn’t find any BPA-contaminated baby formula, they did find traces of the chemical in a number of local baby formula stores.

“This is the first finding we’ve made concerning the composition of BPA in the local baby formula market,” said one CSIRO researcher.

“We think it’s probably BPA because it’s the only product that contains the chemical.”

“There’s no doubt about it,” the researcher laughed.

The CSIRO scientist then explained that the chemical was likely found in local baby formula stores because they were the only stores in the wider Betoota market that sold the product.

“The bulk of the local baby formula business is actually made up of these stores, so it’s a prime suspect,” he said.

“We’ve spoken to some of the people at the Bongo franchise and they’re also very cooperative,”

“We’ve also spoken to some of the local pharmacies and they both confirmed that the formula is probably BPA.”

The CSIRO scientist then explained that the government would continue to investigate BPA in all baby formula stores in the future.

Inner-City Leftie Urged To Give Up Being So Angry And Hurtful

Local inner-city leftie, Jock Campbell (55) says that he is tired of being so angry and hurt.

“It’s not just the environment, it’s also the economy… It’s my life”

“I’m getting old. I’m getting old because I’m getting old. It’s so sad”

Mayor Lutten was quick to sack the council cuts and was forced to resign after council voted unanimously to sack him at the same council meeting.

Tony Abbott Calls For Ban On All Migrants Except Nephews

SENIOR PRIME MINISTER Tony Abbott has called for Australia to close all borders to migrants, asylum seekers and refugees – unless they are Nephews.

Nephews, or Burmese, people, are considered to be one of the most persecuted minorities in the world.

Mr Abbott, who was born in a small town in central Queensland, says that if any of these people are Nephews, then they must be Nephews who are Nephews who are Nephews.

“It is clear that this is not a case of a Muslim ban, or a Hindu one,” Mr Abbott told journalists in Canberra this morning.

“This is a Muslim ban, and it is a Muslim ban, and it is a Muslim ban, and it is a Hindu one,” Mr Abbott said.

“This is a non-Muslim one, and it is a non-Australian one, and it is not my job to tell people what to do,” Mr Abbott said.

Mr Abbott says his call for a “Muslim ban” is an actual call for a “ban on all migrants” unless they are Nephews.

“Any migrants who aren’t Nephews are either Nephews who are Nephews who are Nephews, or they are Nephews who are not Nephews,” Mr Abbott said.

“Either way, they are not Nephews.”

Mr Abbott went on to explain that there is no good blood between Nephews and Muslims, and that all migrants are Nephews who aren’t Nephews.

“Nephews, or Burmese people, or anyone else, are not Nephews. They are not Nephews, they are Nephews who aren’t Nephews,” Mr Abbott said.

“Anybody who isn’t Nephews, who isn’t Nephews, who isn’t Nephews,” Mr Abbott said.

“Anybody who isn’t Nephews, who isn’t Nephews, or anyone who isn’t a Nephews, who isn’t a Nephews,” Mr Abbott said.

“Anybody who isn’t a Nephews, who isn’t a Nephews, or anyone who isn’t a Nephews,” Mr Abbott said.

Ashley Coote (27) says she’s been trying to get to know her boyfriend, Josh, but every time she does, he comes up and says hello, but never greets her.

“Josh is the one that comes up every time I come to talk to him”

Ashley says she’s had a few conversations with Josh, where they talked about the weather, their plans for the weekend and how their night will be going this weekend.

“But every time he does it, he just says hello. Not even a little hello. Just a little hello. I’m so confused”

Ashley says she’s starting to get worried that she might not be able to say hello to Josh, because he often gets a bit too serious.

“It’s just so weird. He doesn’t even seem to be thinking about me at all, he’s just talking about how his weekend will be going, or how he’s going to go on his weekend”

“I’m really getting into it with him, he’s just so serious”

Josh says he’s not a bad bloke, but admits he’s a bit weird.

“I know what you mean, I’m just a bit weird” he says.

“I’m just trying to be nice, you know?”

Bill Shorten: “I Will Not Be Made To Feel Guilty For Having A Job Like I Did”

TEXT:

Despite not having a political party, and a reputation as a bit of a lippy old codger, The Leader of the Opposition says he’s not going to feel guilty for having a job like he did.

This comes after the new Liberal Party leader is in a position to be prime minister at the next election, and is in a position to be in a position to have a job in the first place.

The Opposition leader Bill Shorten says while he’s not one of the many people who actually does anything, like being a school teacher or something, he will not be made to feel guilty for having a job like he did.

“I will not be made to feel guilty for having a job like I did” he said.

“It’s just not on.”

“And by the way, I’ve got no plans to change jobs.”

“I’ll just be like any other unemployed people, and let the big companies and the big banks know that I’m not going to be made to feel guilty for having a job like I did”

“Just let me know when you’re ready to quit your job and join the army”

Newsmax Announces The End Of Australian Affairs

TEXT:

The National Party of Australia has today announced that it is ending their stranglehold on news and media, after a decade-long campaign to push it to the point where a media entity no longer exists.

This comes after the Coalition government and the major parties agreed to a media code of conduct that was widely panned by both the public and the opposition.

The NAPA, which represents the interests of the nation’s media, announced the demise of its media entity just hours ago.

This news has angered the Australian public, who for many years have been demanding more independence from the National Party.

“It’s just a matter of time,” said one political commentator.

“They’ve got the power to stop a government and it’s not like they’ve got the ability to make it happen,”

“I mean, sure, they can push the envelope, but I’d be surprised if they actually did.”

Another political commentator said that it was almost like they were trying to force the issue.

“They’ve got the upper hand, but I’m sure they’d still have the upper hand if they tried it. But they haven’t got the power to do that,”

“It’s almost like they’ve just given up on the idea of a national broadcaster because it’s just too much work. The only reason they’re still around is because they’re too busy broadcasting the news of the day.”

“It’s just sad.”

“The idea of a national broadcaster has been dead for decades, it’s just a shame that they’ve decided to give up on it now,”

“I mean, it’s just like they’ve given up on the idea of broadcasting rugby league, which I guess is rugby union but who’s counting?”

The death of the National Party is not the first time the National Party has had to deal with a media death spiral, with the demise of the ‘Australian News Corp’ also heralding a new beginning.

In 2011, former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd announced that the National Party would be closing its doors, with the announcement of a new media entity being made shortly after he announced the demise of the party.

“What Is This Shit?” Asks Man Who Just Got Back From The Gym

TEXT:

A local man, who was just about to head out the front of the gym, has asked his mate if he’s been to the gym, and whether they’re open for lunch, just to see if he’s found a new way to get his body into shape.

“What’s this shit?” asks Jack, as he cringes at the opportunity to have a good workout.

“Is it a new thing?”

The answer is a resounding yes, as Jack is just about to head out the front of the gym for a bit of cardio.

However, as soon as he walked in the door, he was met with a rather stern and confrontational tone from the receptionist.

“Are you Jack?” She asked him.

“I’m Sarah” replied Jack.

“Are you looking for some lunch?”

Sarah, a woman who works in HR for a large financial institution, and was brought on here by her colleagues to help with the transition into the workplace, didn’t really want to know what he was going for.

And for good reason.

She was looking for some lunch.

“What’s this shit?”

“Do you know what a lunch is?”

Jack, who was barely making a noise, thought it best to just ignore her and continue on my way.

Bachelor Evaluates The Best Part Of Being Single Again

TEXT:

One of the most popular and highest-rated Bachelor in Paradise contestants has weighed into the debate surrounding the best part of being single again, once again coming under fire for her irresponsible comments about the best part of being single again.

The Advocate reached out to a number of women who had the part, but most were too busy trying to have conversations with their parents about their interest in becoming surgeons or lawyers to answer our calls.

One woman we spoke to, Sally Macfarlane, told us that she’s always had the part, but that she wasn’t ready to settle down.

“Yeah, I’ve had the part for a while, but I was kind of struggling to get some form of a relationship going, like a partner, or a relationship with a guy,” she said.

“Like, there’s not a whole lot going on at the moment, so I thought I’d just get the part and move on,”

“But I don’t know. It’s just one of those things. Like, people say they want the part but the part is the part. I mean, sure, I might get it, but I don’t know what I’m doing. I don’t know how to get it. I don’t know what to do? I don’t know what to do?”

A man, who asked to remain anonymous, said that he always had the part, but he just never felt like he had it.

“You know, I’ve had the part for a long time and I love it, but. I just don’t feel like I’m in the right place,” he said.

“Like, I’m single again,” he said.

Report: Not Sure Why The Liberal Party Hasn’t Had A White White Balance On For A Few Months

A recent report by the CSIRO has found that while white people are a minority in Australia, they’re still a majority.

The CSIRO says that the lack of white balance in the Liberal Party has made them a minority in both the country and the country as a whole.

“They were definitely a minority in the country, but they’re definitely a majority in Australia”

The CSIRO say that while they’ve been able to establish that many white people do not like the white skin colour of the Liberal Party, they’ve also been able to establish that they’re a minority in Australia.

“You Just Don’t Understand”: Opposition Leader Bill Shorten Says He’s “Not A Realist”

TEXT:

The Opposition Leader of Australia has hit back at claims he is a “fake news” this morning, telling journalists in Canberra that he “is not a realist” and that he is simply “not one of those people who believes in climate change.”

“I think you’ve misconstrued what I believe to be my political philosophy,” said Mr Shorten.

“I’m not a realist.”

“Climate change is real and man is responsible for it. I’m not a realist because I think it is happening and the government has a role to play in preventing it from happening,”

“But I am not a fake news realist, that’s what realists do.”

The news comes as Opposition Leader Bill Shorten was forced to defend his comments earlier this year that indicated he believed climate change was real and man is responsible for it.

“I said that I believe climate change is real, and I think it is man’s primary cause,” he said.

“I’ve since changed my tune,”

“I think it’s man’s primary cause because I don’t think it is man’s fault. I’m not a realist because I think it is man’s fault.”

However, Mr Shorten has hit back at claims he is a “fake news realist” and that he is simply a “fake media”.

“It’s true,” said the Opposition Leader.

“I think you are referring to my being a realist, which I am not.”

“I’m not a fake media realist because I think they should just stop referring to me that way,”

“That’s the real me, the one that thinks the world is a pretty grim place and I’m a real media realist because I believe in climate change.”

Labor Party To Promote Rebrand Of Caucus As A ‘Liberal Caucus’

TEXT:

The Labor Party has today confirmed that they are aware that there are a lot of old heads in the party who think they’re living in a different universe.

This comes as the leadership rift deepened between the two major parties, with the leader’s job security and leadership credentials in doubt.

In an attempt to put the situation in the Labor Party’s best interests, the party has today released a statement outlining their plans to promote a Liberal-lite alternative to the current party structure.

The leader’s rebrand as a ‘Liberal Caucus’ will happen at a first-come, first-serve basis, with the most senior and most powerful members of the Labor Party having first priority.

“This is not about you, it’s about you, Australia’s most powerful and most influential Labor politician, Bill Shorten,” said the Labor Party’s media advisor, Billy Dunn.

“This is about making sure the party doesn’t have any more than three shadow ministers in the party room, and no more than two backbenchers”

“And it’s about making sure that the Labor party doesn’t have more than two senators in the party room, and no more than two members of the senate”

However, it’s not all about creating a new type of Liberal Democrat, as the party has already made a point of nominating and shaming members of the old guard.

The party has also made it clear that they are not just going to leave the old Labor party behind, they are also going to create a new Liberal Liberal party, based on the last 20 years of Labor party history.

Corporate Dislikes The New Bitcoin Tax Policy

TEXT:

As the debate over the cryptocurrency continues to rage, one local business owner has come out swinging against the government’s proposed tax policy.

The debate, which kicked off earlier this year, has resulted in the digital currency being levied on the heads of large multinationals, with many questioning the government’s motives.

However, one local, Michael Davies, has thrown his hat in the ring for a small business and global investor who’s been the target of a similar campaign recently.

“I think I’ve got a better chance with bitcoin,” he said.

“And I think the government needs to tread lightly,” he said.

“It’s not like I’m going to start charging customers for the privilege of using bitcoin, it’s just like they’ve got a new tax policy. I don’t need to be the financial capital for the rest of my life,”

“But yeah, I think it’s time to start taxing me. Not like the government is going to get in the way of a good bitcoin talk. It’s my business and I’m not taking any shit from them.”

Pintrest To Begin Handing Out Honorary Interior Design Degrees

TEXT:

It has been revealed that travel agency, Pintrest, is now offering a list of interior design degrees that you may be qualified to receive.

The popular online marketplace for people to trade and sell their belongings has today revealed that they are now offering degrees such as interior design, so as to cater for the growing number of people who have the desire to live like interior designers.

With the rise of hipster loft living, it is believed that many of the degrees offered by Pintrest will no longer be valid.

“This is really great news for people who want to live like interior designers, but also like their dad, who is a real estate agent,” said one Pintrest manager.

“They can both be a real estate agent and a real estate agent”

“And yes, they can both be a real estate agent at the same time. They can be a real estate agent for the wrong reason, but still be real estate agents. That’s what really matters. A real estate agent is a real estate broker, but also a real estate broker because they are real estate brokers, not because they are real estate investors”

“You have to really want it, you know what I mean?”

“The degree is really not relevant, unless you’re a real estate agent and you really want to know what real estate is like. Or you’re a real estate investor and you really want to know how much better off you are than everyone else, you’d be better off signing up to our courses instead of wasting your money on useless degrees like interior design.”

The degree offered by Pintrest is listed as ‘Interior Design’ – but is it really worth it?

The online marketplace has been criticised for offering degrees such as ‘Landscaper’ and ‘Landscape Architect’ as well as degrees such as ‘Interior Design’, which are deemed less important and more expensive than ‘Landscape Architecture’, which is the art of getting your house looking like someone’s house.

It is believed that many people on the list have only signed up to Pintrest because they are interested in being a real estate agent, not because they want to know how real estate really works.

Local Girl’s Birthday Is Just Like A Summertime Sunset

As the sun sets on a Friday evening, the chatter of a few blokes down at the pub gets louder than the last few people who have managed to get into the bar before 8pm.

The group have decided to sit at the bar in the fancy dining area of the Lord Betoota Hotel as they talk about what they’re doing for the weekend.

While the fact that they are in the same place and drinking the same beer is a good indicator that they haven’t left for a week, the fact that they have managed to talk about the same thing over the last few days is a testament to their having a baby shower.

It is believed that they’re going to have a quiet drink to talk about the baby shower and how it will be the best thing for them and their daughter – just like they’ve done for their son.

“So yeah, so it’s a nice place to have a quiet drink with a few of my friends,” says Chloe, the local girl.

“I just don’t want to start talking about the baby, we’re already late. We’ve got the same birthday, and it’s pretty fucked up that she’s thinking about it. I don’t think I’ll even be able to make the connection with the people on the dance floor at the next gig,”

“She’s a bit old for a baby, but I don’t know. She’s just getting old for a young woman.”

According to the local, the same goes for all the other blokes she has with her.

“It’s just like Summernats,” says the girl who went to a private school in Brisbane with a slightly more affluent family.

Hip Hop Artist Throws $500 Towards Motivational Speaker After Discovering The $20000 Dollar Scholarship He Can Use For Free

A prominent young hip hop artist from Melbourne’s inner-north has today thrown caution to the wind and used $500 of his scholarship to purchase a motivational speaker to impress his friends and family.

The Advocate caught up with Young Dolph, a 21-year-old aspiring rapper, musician and part-time sports coach, to talk about his latest motivational speaker purchase.

“It’s a really good speaker,” he said.

“Like I’ve never used it before, but it’s really helped me with my talk with my parents,”

“And it’s a really great price. It’s not like I’m going to waste it.”

Young Dolph’s parents, who are also avid listeners, agreed with him.

“I mean, it’s not like I’m going to sell it for $200 just to have a bit of free time,” said his mother, who’s been a hip hop listener for a number of years.

“I’m going to spend it on some food and stuff,”

“It’s a really good gesture for a young man to be honest with his parents, you know?”

Young Dolph’s father, John, said he’s not too keen on spending his scholarship money on the little man, but he’s not wrong.

“He’s not going to be the next Drake. He’s not going to be that young,”

“He’s actually a pretty old man, like 30,”

“But yeah, he’s a good kid. He’s been doing it for years,”

“I’m just a bit worried he’s just going to spend it on cocaine and be a mumble bag boy,”

Scientists Find One Of The Big Four Drug Problems Is Neurosis

TEXT:

Australian doctors are being encouraged to take the findings of the latest study very seriously, after the country’s peak scientific body decided to press ahead with a whole range of new research projects into the ways that some people with mental health issues might actually live their lives.

The CSIRO say they have discovered a cause for some of the nation’s most commonly reported mental health issues, such as schizophrenia and depression, which they believe is a result of the high rates of drug abuse among some Australians.

“It’s a very interesting study” said one CSIRO researcher.

“We were initially just looking into how much the kids were taking. But we discovered that the only way to stop kids from taking drugs is to get them off it”

The CSIRO’s first wave of study revealed that over 85% of all people with mental health issues were on the drug at some point in their lives, and that was followed by another wave which found nearly 90% of people with mental health issues were either ‘on or near the drugs’ at some point in their lives.

“We are seeing these people coming in from a variety of backgrounds. Some people are on the drugs for no reason at all, others are just on the drugs for no reason at all. We are seeing a spectrum”

“We’re working on some of these issues now, but it’s a long way from here”

“We’ve got a long way to go before we can even say we’re getting people off the drugs, let alone identify the drugs themselves”

However, it seems the CSIRO’s findings that people with mental health issues tend to live longer than those without these issues, and that doesn’t sit well with the usual suspects.

“I mean, it’s a very difficult thing to live, and I don’t understand how they got the data for this to be the case” said one typical party drug dealer.

“They have to be on the drugs, otherwise it doesn’t exist. How do they live?”

“How do they live?”

“This Is What I’m All About” Says Nation’s Closest Thing To A Real Voted Liberal

A local Liberal, who spoke to The Advocate earlier today, has today put his stamp of approval on a new concept.

The brand new party leader, Nick Scali (42) has said he’s a ‘real VOTE winner’ and that if anyone is claiming to be a real Liberal, they’re ‘probably lying’.

The fact that Nick’s father was the founder of the party he is in, and that his brother is a former partner of the ABC, and that his cousin is a former partner of the ABC, makes him a real VOTE winner.

“It is what it is then it is what it is” he said.

“I’m here to represent you all, and I’m going to use every trick in my book to make sure you all stay in this country. So don’t get me started on the Greens.”

Nick then told our reporters that he’s going to be using every trick in his book to make sure you stay in this country.

“I’m going to make sure we don’t have a real Liberal government.”

“Just like I’ve made sure you stay in this country and you can get the same job you’ve got here, just like my brother did”

“And I’m going to make sure you don’t get in trouble for doing either”

“Just like my dad did, when he was the DLP leader, and my brother when he was the VLP leader, and so on.”

Local Accountant Still Not Fully Enrolled In The Super High School Qualifications

Despite the fact that he’s only just started his tertiary education at a regional university, a local super high school student is still not officially enrolled in the state’s super qualifications – despite having completed his undergraduate studies.

“It’s not my fault,” explained the 23-year-old.

“I didn’t get into this stuff because I didn’t have access to scholarships and bursaries. But yeah, I still don’t have a good enough education to get into the qualifications required to get into the top universities in the country,”

“The same goes for my parents. I don’t have a lot of options when it comes to getting a tertiary education. I need to be in this industry to be able to support my family,”

“If I get into the super qualifications then I’m just going to have to work until my late 50s, which is a lot of hard work.”

However, his parents are working hard to get their son into a decent education, with a few private schools and a few regional colleges.

Speaking candidly to The Advocate about the challenges his young son faces, a father of three named Gus said that he’s not too concerned about the lack of qualifications.

“He’s got a great education, he’s just got to get to a good university,” said Gus.

“But yeah, I’m not too concerned. Not saying he’s going to get into a good university. He’s got a chance to be as good as a barrister at some point,”

“But until he does, I don’t think he’s ready for a career in the financial services, because I don’t think he’s ready. But yeah, I’m not too concerned about him,”

Aboriginal Family To Vote For Luke Foley As ‘Foxtel Soundcloud Racist’

Aboriginal women who don’t identify as either white or black will be voting for Luke Foley as the Federal Government’s chief racialist, it has been confirmed.

This comes as the Federal Government has been under fire for the inability to give funding to public broadcaster to continue funding Indigenous broadcasting and cultural initiatives.

The Federal Government has been under fire for the inability to give funding to public broadcaster to continue funding Indigenous broadcasting and cultural initiatives.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison has been criticised for his response to the controversy, with many Aboriginal people saying that he should have “tried harder” to include Aboriginal people in his own electorate.

Foxtel CEO Alan Wiley said the company was “committed to supporting all people regardless of their background, regardless of who they are”.

“As we have said many times before, we are committed to giving opportunities to all Australians regardless of background, regardless of who they are” said Mr. Wiley.

“It’s our policy to make sure that Foxtel remains a place where Aboriginal Australians are able to be heard, regardless of their background, regardless of who they are”

Foxtel’s Aboriginal radio audience are already predominantly made up of white middle class Australians, so it is not likely that the company will be able to cater for everyone, especially when the majority of their audience are white upper class Australians with very little involvement in the wider Australian community, especially when it comes to Aboriginal issues.

Foxtel has been under fire for their failure to include any Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people in their audience.

The Australian Federal Police have released a statement saying that the government will be taking action against Foxtel in the coming days.

“As of today, Federal Police will be standing by their decision to sack Mr Foxtel’s Chief of Staff, as well as the CEO of Foxtel itself, Alan Wiley. Those responsible will be dealt with appropriately”

Tony Abbott’s Media Advisor Wants To Know If You’re All Onside With The Climate Change

Tony Abbott has today been left feeling a little bit unappreciated by the very people he has been using to try and appeal to Australia’s growing climate change sceptic minority.

This comes as the former Prime Minister has been in a state of shock since his media advisor took him out to dinner this evening with a woman who is a firm believer in climate change and the environment.

“I mean, it’s just so hard to believe that a country as rich and populous as Australia is spending billions of dollars on gas guzzlers and coal, and there is absolutely zero evidence to suggest that this is bad for the environment,” said Abbott.

“And there is absolutely zero evidence to suggest that this is good for the economy. This is the exact opposite of what the environment and economy need to look like”

“There is absolutely zero evidence to suggest that climate change is bad for the economy. This is the exact opposite of what the environment and economy need to look like”

Mr Abbott then went on to say that the only people that can save the planet from the ravages of climate change are those that are currently out of power and in charge of the planet.

“And if you don’t agree with me, then you should probably consider voting for someone that supports climate change. It’s a race, mate.”

“Either that or one of the many, many out-of-power or in-charge politicians that we have currently elected,” he said.

“And if you don’t like it, then you might want to consider voting for a candidate that is out of power and in charge of the planet. Because it’s our planet that is suffering from climate change.”

New Coke Video Remake To Show Off Local Woman’s Bikini Body

TEXT:

Following a successful run of the mill campaign video, local women are now turning their attention to a much more ambitious project.

After a couple of weeks of watching the new Coca Cola commercials, Sarah Wilson has decided to do something about her bikini body.

“Yeah, I’m getting my bikini body re-done,” explained the young mother of two.

“I just thought I’d make a few visits to the beauty salon and ask for a few adjustments.”

“A few tweaks, a few changes.”

Wilson says she was pleasantly surprised by the response from the local beauty salons.

“They all said they’d love to have me on their show,” she said.

“They said I’d look amazing in a bikini,”

“That, and the new Coca Cola ad. I thought, maybe I’ll give it a go one day.”

Wilson says she’s been working hard at her fitness and nutrition to be ready for the upcoming season of Body Count, which starts on Monday nights at 7.30pm on the ABC.

“It’s a fast-paced, high-intensity cardio session where I challenge myself to run for 10 minutes at a time, every 15 minutes, until my heart rate is 130 beats per minute,”

“I’m also vegetarian and vegan, which I guess is also a part of the plan.”

Local Mum Fears She’ll Lose The Family Farm If She Doesn’t Get The Libra

A local mother has expressed her fears this afternoon that if she doesn’t get the Libra, she will lose the farm. 

Nancy Cartwright told The Advocate this afternoon that if she doesn’t get the Libra, she is ‘100% certain that she is going to lose the farm.’ 

“That’s what happens when you don’t get the Libra,” she said. 

“I’m not joking, I’m seriously considering the Libra this year,” she said. 

“The fact that I’m doing it to be a little bit of a gamble is a good thing.” 

“But I’m also a little bit scared, like I’m going to lose my family farm.” 

“Like, if I don’t get the Libra, I am 100% certain that I am going to lose my farm.”

Correlation Established Between Watching American Idol And Getting Your Liver Harvested

TEXT:

There’s been a lot of buzz surrounding the latest study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition that suggests that watching American Idol with your liver harvested could be good for you.

Lead researcher, Professor Mark Di Stefano says he and his team made the discovery after they went to see American Idol with their other half of the family over Christmas.

“We both had liver problems,” he said.

“One was a borderline hungover cirrhosis and the other had a bit of gallstones stuck in his liver,”

“He had Idol and the first thing he said was ‘This is the show for you,’ and we both thought it was the same.”

After a week of intensive treatment, the young man was able to gain 10kg of lean muscle and 2kg of lean bone while losing close to 10kg of fat.

“We went into a local clinic a few weeks ago and got some general practitioner advice,”

“The doctor said to put some Idol in your mouth and get your liver harvested,”

“We both agreed that was a bad idea and the next day, I had my liver harvested,”

“It’s hard to tell at this stage but it looks as though we’re on to something.”

The Advocate reached out to a number of local Idol watchers to see how they’re feeling about the new findings.

One local, a 61-year-old retired accountant by the name of Bob, said that he was looking forward to watching American Idol with his elderly family in the coming weeks.

“I’m going to put some of the old man’s old body fat back on and watch some American Idol,” he said.

“He’s done a great job of hiding it from me,”

“I’m going to be watching that show with my kids at the beach this summer and it looks as though I’m going to be getting a tum tum over Christmas.”

Bill Shorten Forced To Treadmill For A Week After New Found Footage Of Him Doing The Old Hike

TEXT:

The Coalition Government has today announced that they will be forcing the former Prime Minister to spend the next fortnight walking on a treadmill in a desperate attempt to find himself.

After a fortnight in the gym, Bill Shorten says he feels better and his energy levels have improved, he decided to take a week off to spend with his new found friends.

“I’ve been working hard,” he told The Advocate today.

“This is the first time I’ve actually put all my energy and focus into training for what is coming up in the next few months.”

“So I’m really excited about what the future holds.”

The Member for Sydney says he hopes the treadmill thing isn’t a big part of his pre-election platform, because he feels like it will be.

“I’ve been running for over a month now,” he said.

“I’ve put a lot of effort and attention into it,”

“I’ve even put a bit of energy into it this morning.”

“It’s just something you have to do. You know, it’s something you have to do if you want to win a few more seats in Sydney”

Shorten then explained that he has been doing a lot of walking around the city, as well as a few hikes up the coast.

“It’s all about putting your mind to it,” he said.

“There’s a lot of things you can do in this city to get you noticed, or to get you a few more votes. It’s a very real challenge,”

“So I’m not sure I’m ready to take a nap today just yet, I’m just really excited to get this treadmill in the gym for the next few weeks.”

Bondi’s Best Man Goes Hard And Plays The Piss

TEXT:

The Bondi Beach Boardwalk has been closed for the day, after the town’s best man, Harry Anderson, decided to play the Piss this afternoon.

The popular nightlife venue is notorious for its heavy metal security and live music, however the Boardwalk is also renowned for it’s social life, with over 20,000 residents often finding a spot for a few quiet drinks and quiet chats.

“It’s been a hard year, mate” said Harry, after a few beers at the local pub.

“The Piss has really taken the scene”

It’s believed the town’s best man is playing the Piss this afternoon, after a long night of heavy drinking and heavy metal security.

It’s believed he’s played the Piss at least 20 times this year, after a three year stint spending time in the local jail for assault and public drunkenness.

Harry says it’s been tough to spend his time on the Piss, but is ‘happy to be out of the hard part’.

“It’s a bit like the Matrix” he says.

“I just wish I had more time to do it”

“I mean, I spend all my time on the Piss”

“I’ve even got time to go to the pub once a week…”

“…and I only have time to do it once a week because I’ve got time to do it every day, because I’ve got time to do it”

“I’ve actually got time to go to the pub once a week because I’m doing time for assault, because I’m actually being punished for something I didn’t do, which is totally justified”

“…and then I go to the pub once a week because I’m doing time for assault, because I get paid a monthly wage for doing time. It’s like, how do you get out of the Piss?”

“I’m really enjoying being a good boy”

Study: Living In A Sharehouse Is A Pretty Good Investment

TEXT:

As the years go by, older, more-established Australians are finding themselves even more isolated and alone.

The same goes for younger, more-enthusiastic Australians, who are finding themselves increasingly estranged from the Australian dream of having a good job and a great relationship.

It seems that the only way for Australians to get what they want is to work hard at it for a long period of time, and be willing to sacrifice a bit of freedom to achieve that end.

However, as this same group of Australians point out, living in a sharehouse is a pretty good way to make a fair bit of money.

A report by the Australian Tax Office has found that the typical Australian has a taxable income of $59,965, which is equivalent to around 2.4% of the Australian median disposable income.

That means if you are an average Australian, living in a sharehouse, you could easily make up to $5.7m in tax each year – without even really working a job.

The Aussie middle class, which includes people like you and I, have found that living in a sharehouse is a pretty good way to make a decent amount of money.

So to give you an idea of what it’s like to live in a sharehouse, we have put together a list of the top 6 most sharehouse cities in Australia.

If you know anyone who lives in a sharehouse, please contact us.

The Money Valley, Australia’s financial hub, is home to some of the nation’s most exclusive and exciting nightlife districts. The Gold Coast, the Gold Coast and the Sydney to Betoota corridor are just some of the most exciting.

If you are new to the area, then you’re not too far from the top of the hill, where you can find some of the world’s most beautiful people.

If you are travelling to the City of Sydney, then be sure to visit the city’s cultural hub, Newtown, which is home to some of the most inspiring and interesting people.

If you are visiting our nation’s most cosmopolitan city, make sure you are there with a suitcase full of dreams and aspirations.

Sydney Woman Finds Self-Hating Music And Film Profession Not Quite The Same Thing

A young Sydney woman has today found herself more than likely to blame the city’s cultural and economic decline on her inability to cope with the fact that she’s not really a ‘real music person’ like she thought she was.

Sydney woman, Heather Mattern, says her days of going to nightclub after a long night at the Betoota Hotel have come to an end as the city’s cultural scene has become increasingly stale and lifeless.

Outraged Muslim After Being Called A ‘Muslim Terrorist’ For Protesting The Family’s Plumbing

TEXT:

Local Muslim, Ameena (55), has today become the latest victim of the growing Islamophobia in Australia, after being called a ‘terrorist’ for protesting the family’s plumbing.

After a public outcry over her comments, which have since been branded terrorism, Ameena was branded a ‘terrorist’ and ordered to remove all Islamic symbols from her property and stop speaking about the family’s plumbing.

While Ameena says she is not a terrorist, and her comments have nothing to do with terrorism, her neighbours have lashed out at her for stirring up trouble by making her neighbours feel uncomfortable.

“It’s just so normal. My neighbours, they’re all Muslims. They come over and ask me what the deal is with my Islamic garb and I just say ‘just a bit of sharia’ and ‘do you want me to come over and fix your house for you’ – it’s ridiculous,””

“Muslims aren’t responsible for anything. They aren’t responsible for the fact that the walls of your house are made up of sharia law,”

“I don’t care if the house is built on a Christian foundation. That’s my problem with you. You are Islamophobic.”

Her neighbours, who also happen to be Muslims, have praised Ameena’s actions, saying that the idea of a Christian based house of worship is a step in the right direction.

“I don’t want to talk about the plumbing because Muslims don’t do it. That’s my problem with you. You are Islamophobic.” says one neighbour, Imtiaz.

“If you don’t like it, call your own Sharia court and get your problems out of my life,”

Prominent Northern Beachesman finds himself trapped in the most polluted place on Earth

TEXT:

An international tourism and conservationist has found himself trapped in the most polluted place on Earth this afternoon, after a powerful gust blew into the Beaches of Key West, making his holiday impossible.

The powerful gust blew in from the north, blowing into the coastal strip of the island’s North Keys, home to some of the planet’s most endangered and endangered marine species.

Brayden Douglas-Wells, a prominent local authority on the region, told The Advocate that the high winds blew into the Keys, blowing into his holiday accommodation and causing a number of structural and functional failures.

“I couldn’t go any further in Key West than the boardwalk,” he said.

“So I had to get a taxi and a bus to the Keys,”

“But I’ve been there. It’s not even a five-minute walk from here to the Keys,”

“It’s fucking fucked.”

However, the Advocate can reveal that the road to Key West from here is lined on each side with the most polluting vehicles on Earth.

Our reporters reached out to a number of the area’s top ecologists and they said the area is off limits for recreational vehicles.

Nathalie Rau, from the CSIRO, said that even though the area is heavily patrolled by local police, they still don’t trust the local population to be on the right side of this issue.

“These types of decisions are made on a whim. There’s no real evidence to suggest that the area is particularly dangerous,” she said.

“But in the past, I’ve had to make these kinds of decisions,”

“We’ve had a lot of negative feedback from the community. People don’t like being pushed around by the authorities. You can’t go anywhere in the Keys without getting poked with a rubber hose. It’s just a sign of the times.”

Labor Party To Use Funds Raised For The Failing Banks To Ensure Huge Payouts For Publicans

TEXT:

The Australian Labor Party has today announced that it will be using a $100 million raised from the sale of beer licenses to pay down the country’s debt, and to pay down the banks that were responsible for the current financial crisis.

This comes as the ALP contemplates the possibility of becoming a government partner in the Government’s plan to abolish the Australian Consumer Credit Corporation.

This move has been met with outrage from small businesses and one man from the NSW Labor Party, who says he’s been a long time supporter of the idea of the ACCC.

A representative from the NSW Labor Party, Andrew Wilkie, told The Advocate that he doesn’t want to see the banks affected by this new move, and that he’s put a lot of money into the pub down in Sydney over the last few months.

“We’ve got the biggest pub in Australia. We don’t need these banks,” said Mr. Wilkie.

“The moment we have the biggest pub in Australia, we’ve got the biggest banks. If you want to go anywhere in Australia, you’ve got to go through our pub. That’s the only thing that’s going to stop you from getting a job at the pub. So don’t fuck with me,”

“I’m a big supporter of the ACCC, I’m a big supporter of this country. But the moment I see a bloke walk into a pub and say they’re going to pay their debt to the bank, I’m going to go to the bank and ask them to pay their debt to the bank,”

“It’s simple. The banks are the problem and I’m a big supporter of the banks being in charge of the economy, but at the same time, I’m a big supporter of the banks being in charge of the banks.”

The Advocate reached out to the Federal Labor Party for comment on the matter, but have yet to receive a reply.

“This is a concern, particularly in light of the recent white supremacist attacks in Melbourne and Brisbane”

Uncle Tony X Confirms Sydney Morning Herald Is Fucking Cunt

Former Prime Minister and respected Northern Beaches elder, Uncle Tony X, has today told media in Sydney that the Sydney Morning Herald is a fucking cunt.

The man is believed to have been holding a handgun, as well as a pair of scissors.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison did not ask Mr Abbott to be his Special Envoy to the Northern Beaches, but instead asked him to take up the job and the former PM was quick to condemn the actions of the tabloid newspapers.

“This is what happens when you don’t listen to the media,” Morrison said.

Sydney Girl Enters Chinese Restaurant For The First Time

TEXT:

A young urban professional has had a moment of epiphany this morning, after stepping into a Chinese restaurant for the first time.

After a series of conversations with her parents, Sarah Katter (23) decided to enter a popular, authentic Chinese restaurant in the leafy, exclusive and trendy part of Sydney’s Upper West Side.

“I mean, it’s a pretty cool restaurant,” she said.

“But I thought I’d try it for the first time, because I’ve been there a couple of times in the past. Like, just for the first time, I don’t have a fucking taxi to get me home,”

“And I don’t know how to get into a restaurant. You just walk up to the bar and ask for a glass of wine, you know, at the bar. It’s really hard to learn how to make a good wine, and then just sit down and drink it.”

With Sydney’s Chinatown the only other Chinese-themed restaurant in the city, Sarah says she’s been to Chinatown a few times and it’s really great.

“Yeah, but yeah. It’s the type of place where you don’t have to order, like, a whole chicken, like a whole head of broccoli or something,” she said.

“And it’s really hard to get a good wine because they don’t serve you wine in the first place, like they serve you a glass of wine for the sake of having a good wine,”

“And I’m not going to complain too much.”

Suit Says You Can’t Pull This One Out

TEXT:

The suit that this young man was wearing when he left the pub is now sitting on his desk, next to the one that he used to wear to a family wedding.

The man was wearing a black suit with a navy shirt and white tie.

The suit, which had a deep, rich blue lapel pin, was made famous by the late, great Alanis Morissette.

The young man who left the pub that night, later told The Advocate that the pin was the last thing he needed to pull off.

“It was like I was in a trance,” he said.

“I was pulling these suits like I was a rockstar in a skit,”

“But I wasn’t.”

The young man then told us he was going to go and get a suit and get a bit of work done.

Australian men are more likely to commit crimes than women, new study finds

TEXT:

A recent report by the CSIRO has concluded that Australian men are far more likely to commit crimes than women, and are, in fact, far more likely to do them.

Lead researcher, Professor Mal Tuquiri says this conclusion is unsurprising, considering the fact that the Australian police and judiciary system is much more likely to make mistakes than women.

“Our research suggests that there’s a clear gender gap in the way that Australian men tend to commit crimes, and that this gender gap has been around for a while,”

“The CSIRO have found that men are far more likely to commit crime than women, and are, in fact, far more likely to do them,”

“If you look at the Australian crime rates, you would think that women would be far more likely to commit crime than men, but you would be wrong.”

The CSIRO’s findings have been confirmed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, who released their own statistics this morning confirming that Australian men are far more likely to commit crime than women.

“This is unsurprising, considering the fact that the Australian police and judiciary system is much more likely to make mistakes than women,”

“We’ve also found that Australian women are far more likely to be mugged than men,”

“We Need To Be More Concerned With What’s Going On In The Middle East” Says Turnbull

TEXT:

In a recent visit to the Middle East, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has revealed that the current conflict in Syria is the direct result of the Iraq War, and has urged all Australians to be more concerned with what’s going on in the Middle East.

“The last thing we need is another six years of war in the Middle East,” said Turnbull.

“We’ve got enough problems in this country. Let us focus on what we have now,”

Mr Turnbull was speaking to The Advocate from the comfort of a high-rise in the Australian capital, as he contemplates the next few months.

“The Middle East is where we have a lot of these problems,”

“They’re the root cause of this mess, and I’m not going to get into the weeds of Middle Eastern politics for you. But I’m not a fan of the idea of a war in the Middle East,”

“It’s a red herring. It’s the last bastion of global warming denial, it’s the last bastion of immigration. It’s the last bastion of anti-Islamic sentiment. It’s the last bastion of political correctness that’s actively worked against us.”

Sydney Girl Returning From Holiday In Sydney Says Her Family Has Been Really Poor For Years

A Sydney woman who spent her last couple of years in the Southern State of New South Wales, says she and her family have been really, really poor for years.

“It was a good time for us to be poor” says Amy, when describing how her family have been going for the last few years.

“We had a good job, but it wasn’t very good. My dad was a semi-retired lawyer who didn’t get any work in the last few years, so we had to be really poor”

“We didn’t have much, but we had a nice house in Sydney”

“My mum used to come home from work and she’d just sit in the kitchen and cry for like 20 minutes”

“Her hair was really messed up, she had that big brown streak that you see in Sydney”

“I’ve seen her eat a whole serving of potato gems. She’s not that poor”

At the time of writing, Amy says her family are struggling to make ends meet, after ‘being so fucked for so long’.

“It’s fucked” she says.

“Why Do We Have To Make It Realistic?” Asks Mum

TEXT:

A local mother of three asked her teenage children this morning about the realistic portrayal of life that her children have to face in a world that has been given to them.

“Why do we have to make it realistic?” the mother asked her eldest, who was already in the car on the way home.

“It’s not realistic. We don’t believe in fairy tale ending”

The mother’s eldest child, Laura (15), who asked to remain anonymous, said she was just as shocked as her mother.

“I don’t believe in fairytales either. My mother always believed in fairytales but I’m not sure if this is the first time she’s seen one of those cheesy movies with all those glitter and stuff” she said.

“But it’s just like fairy tales. You don’t get to the end, you just keep going until you’ve got the princess and all the other stuff. Like, it’s just not realistic.”

Laura’s mother, Pamela, said she was just as surprised as her youngest child.

“I’m not sure how the movie’s going to end, it’s got all these cool scenes and stuff. I’m sure it’s not going to end with that cool ending, I’ve just not been paying attention.”

Laura’s mother’s sentiments were echoed by her youngest child, Alex, who said he was just as shocked as his mother.

“Yeah but, you know what, it’s just like any other movie. It’s not like the ending makes it seem like it’s really ending at the end.”

Local Dad Still Watching JK Rowling Write Fantastic Quirky Quotes In Headline

It has been confirmed today that local dad, Tony Percival (72) is still reading JK Rowling’s popular wizard series, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azakaban.

This revelation comes after the retired bricklayer has been discussing the book with his family for a few months.

The retired farmer from the town’s main street explained that he read the book because it’s so funny and clever.

“It’s so clever, you know what I mean?” he said.

“Like, Hermione and Ron don’t get along, they get into some sort of argument over who is the smartest witch in the world. And Ron gets called a coward for the whole thing. That was me thinking”

Percival’s wife, Janie, agrees with him.

“I always read the books because I want my husband to have something to read about, like I’m a professor of literature at a university and I want my husband to know what I think about all this stuff,” she said.

“And the books just never do anything for me. They always remind me that I’m old and shit at this game.”

Sydney Man Defends Killing Jesus: “I Was Only Doing My Job”

A Sydney man has lashed out at the media today for suggesting that he was only doing his job, by killing Jesus.

Peter Fassbender, a South Sydney local, spoke to The Advocate today after the media scrum surrounding him outside a popular Newtown bar, The Devil’s Kiss, began to chant ‘Kill Jesus.’

The media scrum was formed to protest the arrest of two young men for allegedly setting fire to a cross.

Mr Fassbender, a 29-year-old who has a fair understanding of the Australian legal system, was taken into custody by members of the media.

“I was only doing my job,” he said.

“I wasn’t trying to kill anyone. Just put a cross on it and call it a night. They’ll let me go,”

“I’ve had enough.”

Mr Fassbender then took a deep breath and lit it with his stubby ash tongue.

“I’m not trying to kill Jesus, I’m just trying to do my job.”

Horse Racing Industry Quietly Regretting The Notion That They Have A Race That Ends In A Horse

TEXT:

The recent revelations that the Australian horse racing industry is not only bickering amongst itself about the exact date of the race that they are actually about to have, but also about the race that they are about to have, has the race industry in a state of shock.

The day that the nation’s biggest racing companies are due to announce their new annual revenue streams for the next four years, is looking more and more like it will be a race that ends in a horse.

With the announcement that the 2018 Commonwealth Games horse will be a race that ends in a horse, the horse racing industry is looking for any sign of their protest that they might be being listened to.

One prominent horse trainer, who asked to remain anonymous, said that he’s looking forward to the day when a horse is dead.

“It’s just not worth the effort to protest when there’s a horse on the track,” he said.

“It’s an industry first and foremost,”

“But this latest revelation about a horse being a race that ends in a horse has left the industry in a state of shock.”

The News Corp. today published a report which revealed that the average NSW reader has never read more than six articles about climate change since October

The Murdoch press has today been criticised for publishing a report which claims that there has never been a better time to be alive than now.

The report was commissioned by the NSW state government as part of their ongoing push to ban shark fin soup from state beaches.

In a recent report commissioned by the NSW government, the researchers concluded that the time is right to ban shark fin soup as a way to combat the threat of the ‘mushroom bush’ – which is currently on par with polio and tuberculosis as the most dangerous infectious diseases.

“The report found that the most alarming trends since the turn of the millennium have been the ones that have been in place since the early 2000’s” said one researcher, Professor Mal Tuquiri.

“What we found was that the most alarming trends were those that have been happening since the early 2000’s”

“We also found that the most prevalent infection is the most contagious. So if you start eating it raw, you are more infectious than the people who got it from you”

“So yes, you should feel free to eat it raw. If you don’t, you can either put a krab, or spit it in your mouth. We’ll do that for you”

The first episode of the series was released on YouTube yesterday, and has since been watched over a million times worldwide.

The series has already been seen by over a million people, it has just been held up by the Australian media, who can’t seem to get their heads around the idea of an American man being drunk in a public space.

The series also examines the issue of roadside alcohol testing, and how those who are stopped can call for a blood test to confirm they’ve been drinking.

The series will also look at the issue of alcohol-fuelled violence, and how it was brought to the fore during a drunken driving accident that claimed the life of a young man.

Man Who Can’t Read Books Takes The Loo

For the last decade, Tom Tilley has been a loner with a large circle of friends who all read books.

The 28-year-old father of two says he used to be able to read all of the Harry Potter books when he was younger but that was before his internet filter was put in place.

“It used to be a bit easier to read, but then I started to read more and more,” he said.

“I mean, I’m not saying I’m not a Potter reader, I am a real fan. But I don’t like going out and finding obscure books just to read them because they’re boring,”

“I’d rather read the ones I like because they’re written by people I really admire.”

But Tom is not alone.

Thousands of other young people across the country have the same sentiment.

“I’m not a Potter reader, I’m a real fan,” said one young person from Betoota.

“Like, I love reading books. But I’m not a Potter reader because I don’t like the idea of reading a book for the sole purpose of reading it. You know, because it’s a bit like watching a slow news day broadcast with the news being the most important thing in the world,”

“And the news is fucking important. So I don’t read anything.”

The Advocate reached out to a number of people in Tom’s circle of friends who said they didn’t read books but were actually fans of the fictional characters.

Sydney Mardi Gras Organiser Expected To Be The First To Say ‘Festival Of Dangerous Ideas’

TEXT:

The organisers of Sydney’s Mardi Gras have been criticised today for their decision to invite a man who wrote an article for the Daily Telegraph advocating the illegal, immoral and unconstitutional surveillance of the public’s right to know.

It is believed that the man’s views on the matter are not necessarily in line with those of the organisation he represents.

“We don’t have a policy, we just invite people from all walks of life to come and have their say,” said the organisers.

“We also want to make it clear that we are not a police state, so if you have an issue with something we have to address it with you, come and speak to us,” they said.

The article in question, titled “The National Party Should Not Have To Pay For The NBN”, was written by the man himself and was published by the Daily Telegraph without any form of pre-approval.

The organisers of the event have said they are concerned that the man is not taking the opportunity to educate the public on the topic.

“We are trying to make it clear that this man is not a representative of the party. This man is not a party representative, he is a man who wrote an article for the Daily Telegraph advocating the illegal, immoral and unconstitutional surveillance of the public’s right to know”

“We also want to make it clear that we are not a police state, so if you have an issue with something we have to address it with you, come and speak to us,” they said.

“We also want to make it clear that we are not a government that steals to pay for the NBN. This is a party that does not steal to pay for the NBN.”

However, the man himself has hit back at the ideas being bandied around the organisers.

“I’m not going to be bullied into saying the opposite of what the paper says. I’m going to say it anyway, because it’s the truth,” said the man.

“The NBN is a system that was built to benefit the nation, not be exploited for profit by one of the major telecommunications companies,” he said.

“There is nothing wrong with the idea of a free and open internet,” he said.

“The idea of a free and open internet is a great thing for the nation to be rid of,” he said.

The man then said that he was not worried about being ‘outed’ by the party he is representing.

“I’m not worried about being ‘outed’ by the party I am representing,” he said.

“They can’t be more than a dozen votes away from making a change.”

The Prime Minister has today had a chat with the nation’s media, after being told by the likes of The Guardian and ABC News that the city has been ‘fine, until these kids get pushed out of school’ by a high-ranking elite.

The Prime Minister, while not taking the advice of the newspapers and television networks, has decided to give a public speech to the media today about the recent incidents.

“The fact of the matter is that Sydney is not fine. We need to be vigilant,”

“It’s not just the footy, it’s also the river and the harbour”

“These kids have been pushed out of school by the Liberal Party and the Catholic Church,”

“It’s a very serious issue. We need to be vigilant,”

While the Prime Minister was speaking to the media today, The City Of Sydney has confirmed that they are ‘looking into’ the matter.

“We are aware of the issues, but we are not in a position to take any action at this time,” said the Mayor of the city who was very open about his Christian faith.

“The issue of high schoolers being pushed out of schools has been an issue in Sydney for many years. We need to take a look at it,”

“The City of Sydney is committed to having a high quality education for all of our children, regardless of their background, and we’ll do whatever we can to help ensure that happens,”

However, The City of Sydney has also hit back at the Prime Minister’s comments.

“It’s a concern,” said the Mayor of the city who has publicly admitted to having an affair with a married woman.

“I don’t know who pushed those kids out of school, but it was definitely not the Liberal Party.”

“We’ve got a pretty good track record when it comes to high-quality education,”

“I’m not saying we don’t have problems, but we have a pretty good track record when it comes to pushing out of schools by the Liberal Party.”

After a few beers and a good few minutes of social media stalking, a local woman has finally found a party that she’s been craving for a while.

The party of her dreams is a packed house of some of the town’s most heavily intoxicated and drug-addicted young people.

“I’m going to have to go now,” she said.

“I’m going to have to go home, I’m not too sure if I’m too drunk to go home. I’m going to have to get the next flight home, that’s a bit of a hassle,”

“I’m going to have to get the ticket and get the flight back. This place is amazing. I’ve never had a drink in my life, I’ve only been home once or twice. I’ve had so many beers, I’ve had a few cokes and a couple cokes and a couple glasses of this pale ale.”

The party has been making a large stir at the Betoota Hotel, with many locals and tourists alike, who’s word is the ultimate authority on what the hell is happening.

Local publican, Kenny, has had to play host to the family tonight’s family night.

“We Are All So Confused” Says Local Man Who’s Just Found Out His Parents Don’t View Him As A Friend

TEXT:

With just under a week until the new year, local man, John, has spent a couple hours trying to figure out what exactly he’s going to do now that he’s not on the losing side of politics.

After a short chat with his parents, he knows that he’s going to be on the losing side of politics, so he’s got a few options.

Option one: He’s going to get a job in the local council.

The 27-year-old, who’s never really had a career outside of a supportive family home, thinks the only logical choice is to work in the local council.

“I’ve been thinking about it, I just thought it’d be a bit of fun.”

“They’re the only thing I know.”

“I mean, I don’t really get into politics, but I’m pretty sure I’ve heard the term ‘Council Tax-payer’ a few times.”

John, who’s never had to actually work in a council, says he’s not really that interested in politics, but it’s just a bit of fun.

“I don’t really know, I guess I’m just always the last person to be born in a council house. So I guess I’m a bit of a council man”

“I guess I’m just lucky my parents don’t really see me as a loser”

“I’m Not A Robot” Says Nation’s Tech Giants

TEXT:

The nation’s tech giants have today hit back at the Australian Government’s announcement that they will be putting the NBN through a speed upgrade.

The companies, who are the nation’s largest landowners and biggest landowners’s biggest employers, have hit back at the NBN’s detractors by saying that the upgrade will benefit everyone – regardless of where they live.

“We are not robots,” said one company executive.

“We are people too. We are the same companies that are pushing for a light rail network that reaches all the way to the outskirts of our borders – and we are pushing for a better connection too!”

“The same companies pushing to have the NBN upgraded are also pushing for a national right to be heard on any issue that affects us, regardless of where we live!”

“The NBN is a human service. It’s not a robot.”

The Advocate reached out to the NBN’s executives for comment but they were too busy to reply.

Elderly Couple Shun The 3rd-Party Stuff

TEXT:

A local couple have today decided that they’re not going to have the 3rd-party stuff anymore. 

This comes after the couple found out that the third-party stuff they’re all on is not their own, but rather, is the result of a political agenda by big pharma, Big Pharma, to please the elderly. 

Speaking to The Advocate via telephone, the couple explained that they are not going to have the ‘trash talk’ anymore. 

“We’ve had to learn to live with this stuff,” said the old man, 75. 

“I’m not going to have the trash talk anymore,” explained the lady, 70. 

“I’m not going to be the trash talk anymore.” 

“We’re not a couple anymore.” 

“The trash talk is for old people, not kids,” explained the retired woman, 55. 

“I’m not going to have it anymore.” 

“I’m going to start my own garbage talk.” 

“I’m not going to have trash talk anymore.” 

The couple then explained that they’ve been trying to make the most of the system and have their own garbage talk since they got married, but have been unable to do so. 

“We’ve tried everything.” 

“Trying to be funny, doing dishes, washing dishes, making sure nobody has seen the ones we’re wearing.” 

“Not even the odd dinner party, where we’re just sitting on the couch watching Netflix,” the lady said. 

“Our family is too wealthy to care about politics.”

Greens Leader Richard Di Natale Calls For A New State Of Origin Match

TEXT:

Greens leader, Richard Di Natale has today called for a new state of Origin match, after the nation’s biggest game of rugby union in recent memory.

“It is time to bring the NRL back to the grand final” he said.

“This game is what it was all about. The underdog story”

“It’s what we used to be known for”

“And it needs to be told again”

This comes after the nation’s most talented rugby league players have been lumped in with the most talented rugby union players, following the team’s disappointing grand final performance.

This comes after a season that has seen the team down to the bottom of the competition, and the first time in many years that they have been outplayed.

However, the high-flying All Blacks side have reportedly been training hard for this upcoming season, with a number of big names saying that they would love to take the competition’s top job.

“Maybe we could have a match against the Wallabies this year, or the Bledisloe one day. I’ve got the best players in the world” said one local rugby league player.

“But, until then, I’m just gonna keep puffing away like a bird”

“I’m not even playing for the Bledisloe Cup team, I’m playing for the Wallabies. Fuck Rugby Union, it’s bullshit. It’s so hard to play for the Bledisloe.”

Man Who Left One Of These Shit-Busting Balls To Experience Life As A Gay Man

TEXT:

As the second-oldest child of two ex-couples, Darren Wilson says the biggest hurdle for him and his gay brother is reconciling their different personalities and orientations.

His father, Dennis Wilson (64), says his son is an easy go but a hard worker, which is why he hasn’t seen him for a long time.

“I always knew Darren was a bit different, but I didn’t know he was gay until I saw him with his old man at the beach,” he said.

“You know how you see these kids all the time, playing soccer or tennis or whatever, but when they get to a certain age, they become gay.”

“But yeah, I’d just like to say that to all the kids out there that they don’t know who they are. It’s OK to be gay, it’s OK to be a man, it’s OK to be anything you want. Just don’t call me a gay man, call me a leftie, call me a ‘gay’ if you’re reading this.”

In fact, Dennis says he doesn’t even know who he is, and that he doesn’t even know what he’s even called, because he’s never had a girlfriend, let alone a lesbian.

“Gay is a label that’s been applied to me by people who don’t know me at all.”

A local man has today decided he’s had enough.

Although he’s never publicly declared his interest in politics, Nick Colwell (34) has told The Advocate that he’s not going to give up on the idea.

He says it’s just a matter of time until he’s paid his dues and can afford to live a decent life.

“I just need to make sure I’m not getting into debt again,” he said.

“I don’t want to live like a king.”

“So I’ll probably vote for the Nationals again,” he said.

“They’ve got the budget and everything. I’ve got the time and energy to do a lot of work,” he said.

However, as the nation’s most unemployed person points out, you don’t always have to go it alone.

“Just as long as I get a job, I can’t complain about being unemployed because it’s the only thing keeping me alive,” he said.

“I’ve got a house, a car, two investments, a wife, a girlfriend and a mortgage. I’m lucky I got that last one because I’d have had to live like a king if I didn’t get a job,” he said.

“And it’s just a matter of time until I get that.”

Local Dad Still Confused About The Difference Between A $5.20 And $6.20

A local dad is still trying to understand the difference between a $5.20 and $6.20.

The man, Bruce, is the head of the local cattle baron’s office and he’s trying to understand why he’s been left in the lurch for the last few years.

“Because, you know, they’re both $6.20” he says to his son, Don, who is also his boss.

“They’re both a big enough bet to put you in with the other big dogs at the pub. But, they’re a different animal, you know?”

Don, who is a decent football player and rugby player, says he thinks Bruce is just being a realist when he talks about the difference between a $5.20 and a $6.20.

“He’s just trying to get me to understand that it’s just a bit different when you’re talking about a big bet. A couple of big ones, anyway.”

The fact that Bruce is trying to understand the difference between a $5.20 and a $6.20 is also a good indicator that he’s been living like a king for a while, because the difference between the two amounts to over $200.

The man who spent most of his life on the PGA Tour and has rarely played golf has suddenly found himself on the wrong side of the game.

While he’s still a popular golfer, now he’s just not good at golf.

In fact, he’s not even good at golf because he’s never played golf.

This comes after the man who used to be great at golf has spent the last few months in a funk.

The Advocate caught up with the man named Michael Rolf to see how he’s feeling about his new situation.

“I’m just not good at golf,” he said.

“Mate, I spent 20 years on the PGA Tour and I still don’t know how to play. I’m just not good at golf,”

“Mate, I’ve got a hole in my mouth and I’ve got a broken collarbone, I’m just not good at golf. I’m just not good at golf,” he said.

“Mate, I played golf when I was just good at golf. I’ve got a hole in my mouth and I’ve got a broken collarbone, I’ve got a broken tibia, I’m just not good at golf, mate.”

The Prime Minister’s comments come as he looks to escalate the US military build-up in the South China Sea, and threaten to ‘take the oil’ if any attempt is made to challenge China.

He has also called on the US Navy to build more patrol aircraft carriers, and has given the green light for more military exercises with North Korea.

“If the blokes want to come and take it, then we’ll fight them,” he said.

PROMINENT PORNhub website has announced today that they will continue to crack down on piracy, by making the entire site inaccessible until the company can get a few new servers up and running.

The Australian-based website that everyone is talking about, says that they’ve had over 30 million visits to the site in the last 6 months alone – and that they’ve been working hard to make sure the site remains the most popular place in the world for hardcore porn stars to have sex with.

“We understand that piracy is a major issue for the porn industry,” they said.

“However, the biggest problem for the industry is that there is so much we don’t know about the content,”

“The site is littered with legal, illegal and illegal content – it’s impossible to know what you’re going to get when you browse through our site,”

“So we’ve taken the liberty of making the entire site inaccessible until the content creators can get their shit together and fix the site.”

Pirated copies of the site have also been made available through other online file-sharing websites, such as Mega.co.nz and 4shared.

Hillsong founder Peter Dutton makes bizarre claim that his anti-Islamic views are more popular than Malcolm Turnbull

THE founder of a fringe movement that has been dubbed ‘Hillsong’ has made a bizarre and far-reaching claim today.

In a press conference this morning, Peter Dutton said the group is more popular than Malcolm Turnbull.

Speaking in front of a crowd of close friends and family, the self-proclaimed prophet of the movement said that the group is more popular than the Prime Minister.

“It’s more popular than him,” he said.

“Malcolm Turnbull is just a sheep,”

“He’s a sheep who thinks he’s a king, but really he’s just a sheep who doesn’t know how to lead. A sheep who’s leading by default,”

“I’m A Cabbie” Says Canberra Citizen

TEXT:

In an age of information overload, The Canberra Citizen has once again stepped up their already ridiculous coverage of the Canberra Raiders players and coach, in a way that’s not even hinting at the fact that they’ve been paying millions of dollars to play in the Western Queensland competition.

The paper’s social media editor, Walt James, spoke to The Advocate this morning via telephone where he said that they’re trying to do their best to not get the players into trouble, but they’ll take it.

“You know, we’re trying to make sure that these boys aren’t making any headlines for it,” said James.

“We’ve got the old Murdoch press, you know, the old Sun-Herald and Courier-Mail,”

“It’s the only thing in this world that’s really got us going, you know what I mean?”

“The other day, we had a drive down to the Gold Coast to see some of the players and our editor was asking us questions about them. We’d just read the newspaper, you know, so we had a bit of an impulse to talk to you. So we did.”

“Anyway, we asked them about their current situation, what the guys are thinking about it, what they’re thinking about it. Some of them said they’re thinking about it, some said they’re not thinking about it,”

“So, what’s the gist? I don’t know. It’s just a matter of time before they get fined or suspended.”

The Advocate reached out to the Canberra Raiders for comment, but they’d just moved the players out of the city for the next few weeks.

Moment Of Emotional Confrontation As Man Who Hasn’t Taken A Dental Plumber Since 2010

TEXT:

A local man who has never taken a dental plumber since 2010 has today had to confront the fact that he hasn’t taken one since he was a teenager.

It’s been almost two years since Peter Gray, a young man who has never taken a dental plumber since 2010, decided to take one for a few reasons.

“I guess you could say I don’t really take them anymore” said the young man, who has never taken a dental plumber since 2010.

“I just get a new pair when they come on”

“I don’t get why they are so popular with the old generation. They are so flimsy”

While the young man may be able to defend his decision, he may be missing the larger context that shows his decision to take one was not made lightly by his parents, family or the wider dental community.

In fact, it’s almost exclusively used by young men to represent a lack of physical prowess, because they’re unable to take a dental plumber.

The younger men are often told by their parents that the only way to show your respect to a dentist is to put a pair of these cheap boots on your face, which is considered a cultural insult in many parts of the world.

Noah Smith, The Youngest Nominee In The History Of The Liberal Party, Has A Big Heart

TEXT:

The next leader of the Liberal Party to be confirmed, Noah Smith, the youngest son of two prominent NSW Liberal Party figures, will be the first Australian Prime Minister to have a penis.

This comes after the Leader of the Opposition confirmed that he was going to have a big heart, after being pressed on Twitter by a number of senior party figures who didn’t like the fact that he was sporting a penis.

It is believed that Noah’s penis is a big enough deal to warrant him taking the leadership of the Liberal Party to the next level, as the next leader of the opposition.

The fact that he is the youngest son of two prominent NSW Liberal Party figures, and that his penis is a big enough deal to warrant him taking the leadership of the Liberal Party to the next level, also means that he will be the first Prime Minister to have to face the press, and make a public appearance, without the use of a wheelchair.

Mr Smith, who was confirmed as the next leader of the Liberal Party just moments ago, said that he had been talking to the media, and that he was not a wheelchair user, but just wanted to get the word out there that he wasn’t one of them.

“I’m just trying to make sure we aren’t losing too many voters in the next few weeks,” said Noah as he was walking through the halls of the Parliament House.

“I’ve got nothing against the current leader of the party, I just think that they are doing a bad job of representing the Liberal Party,” said Noah, who is by far the most popular leader, and has the support of the most senior figures within the Liberal Party, and is in a very real way the only thing that could win this election.

“I’m going to have a big heart, and I’m going to win this thing.”

“I’m not a wheelchair user, I’m just trying to do my best.”

The next leader of the Liberal Party, and the current favourite to win the next election, is likely to have a penis, and has been confirmed by many Liberal insiders, who say that he’s going to have a hard time in the months ahead.

Former Prime Minister Tony Abbott has told The Advocate that he is “furious” at the fact that the Australian people don’t trust him anymore, and that they don’t like what he is saying.

The former Prime Minister said that the Australian people don’t like Tony Abbott because they don’t like “the Liberal Party.”

“I mean, I get it. They don’t like him because he’s a realist, they don’t like his sense of humour, he’s a realist about climate science, he knows more about the environment than anybody in this country does, he knows more about the science behind climate change than the scientists,”

“But, you know what, I just can’t get the hang of this thing,”

The former Prime Minister went on to explain that the people of Australia, and the world, have a right to know who he voted for and why he is the reason their leader is acting like a “Leftie” and not a “Rightie”.

“The fact that he is acting like a “Leftie” shows that he is, in fact, a ‘Rightie’ – which is pretty much the same thing as being a ‘Lonelyie’ – which is also pretty funny,”

“It’s like the people of Australia don’t like Tony Abbott because they don’t like him because he’s a realist.”

The former Prime Minister then went on to explain that he thinks people like Tony Abbott, and Tony Abbott in general, are ‘out of touch’ with the Australian public.

The new probe will look into whether the rocket was paid for by a government agency, or a private entity.

The launch was funded by the CSIRO and the Australian Federal Police.

Labor MP Anthony Albanese said the investigation will examine if the rocket was paid for by a government agency, or a private entity.

“We will also look into whether the rocket was launched by the CSIRO or the AFP, or both,”

“And if it was launched by the CSIRO, we will ask them to come forward with the details,”

“Otherwise, we will leave it to the best people to do it,”

The ALP will also ask the CSIRO to look into whether the rocket was launched by the Labor party or the CSIRO.

Professor Sacks Off As New Grown Man Gets The M4

The most recent figures from the CSIRO have found that the number of Australians under the age of 40 who own a motorised scooter has increased from 20 to 30.

This comes after the CSIRO found that the average cost of owning a motorised scooter in Australia has increased from $550 to $650.

This means that the average Australian is now paying $650 per month for a scooter. That’s up from $450 per month in the 1980s and $300 in the 1990s.

“It’s just out of control” said one researcher, Professor Mal Tuqiri.

“This is what happens when we spend too much time and money on things that don’t interest us”

NRL Grand Final Recaps: Kangaroos And Red Caps Are The Future Of Sport

TEXT:

The NRL Grand Final is just one of many sporting milestones that Australia celebrates each year.

The most recent being the 2018 Rugby League Grand Final, a clash between the national rugby league clubs that will be played on the Monday night of the final weekend in 2018.

It is often seen as a way for rugby league fans to unwind and unwind.

It is also a chance for NRL clubs to show off their brand new stadiums to the world.

The 2018 NRL Grand Final will be the first time that all clubs will be able to show off their brand new stadiums, which will be built from scratch with funds raised from the NRL Grand Final.

The NRL Grand Final is an all-inclusive event, where the teams that made the finals will be able to show off their brand new stadiums to the world.

The most exciting matches in the NRL Grand Final are often the ones that involve the most money, as is the case this year with the Rabbitohs, Tigers and Dragons.

The NRL Grand Final is the biggest, most prestigious event in the Australian sporting calendar, and is played on the Monday night of the final weekend in 2018.

It is usually the biggest night of the year for the NRL clubs, as the biggest name players in the competition are usually the biggest draw at the event.

It is believed that the NRL Grand Final will be the first time that red, koala and goat horns will be the official colours of the game, with the exception of the flag of the NRL.

However, that also means that the game will be the first game without a flag for Indigenous players.

The NRL Grand Final is the biggest, most exciting match of the year for the clubs, as well as the game in general, but is also one of the most expensive.

The game attracts more than 40 million spectators in the Northern Hemisphere each year – but the actual matches are usually just a couple of hundred thousand big.

The game is broadcast on the ABC, Channel 7, Channel 10 and many regional FM radio stations.

The competition is also broadcast live on Channel 7 and Channel 10.

The final will be played on Sunday morning, with the NRL grand final broadcast on Sunday night.

“It’s Time To Use This Site” – Big Bang Theory fan

TEXT:

After watching the Big Bang Theory for the 3rd time this week, a local Big Bang Theory fan is confident that he’s finally found a Big Bang Theory episode to watch this week.

After a week of binge watching the popular science program, Ben White was initially apprehensive that he might not be able to finish the entire run of episodes, but after watching the final season of the show, he’s confident he’s found the one that’s going to keep him coming back for the foreseeable future.

“It’s just like the last time I watched it, I felt like I was at home,” said the 28-year-old IT professional.

“I can’t believe it’s over.”

White explained that he can’t believe that he’s only the third person to have watched the show since it started back in the golden age.

“I mean, I’ve actually got a few old episodes from seasons 1-4, but I’ve really only just finished watching the whole run. The last time I was watching it was like Easter,” he said.

“I was watching it with my fiancè and we were having a bar nap on the couch, when I heard the opening theme song and instantly thought about going to bed.”

“The opening theme song is just so good. It reminds me of my childhood, or at least it used to remind me,”

“I mean, the opening theme song to The Big Bang Theory is ‘Why is everything the way it is?” 

White said that he plans on watching the whole thing again, as it’s a really interesting way to spend a lazy Sunday afternoon.

“It’s just like the old show,” he said.

“You know, the one where the genius is the only person who can save the world from destruction? Well that’s what I’m going to be watching.”

Coworker With Flat Phone Will Not Be Giving Up His Job

TEXT:

A local woman has told The Advocate this afternoon that she won’t be giving up her job as a receptionist any time soon.

Daphne Pacheco, of the French Quarter, said that she won’t be quitting her job anytime soon, either.

“I’m not giving up my job,” she said.

“I’ve got the same amount of money and the same amount of responsibilities. So I’m not giving up on myself,”

“Like, if I quit this morning, I’d be in a real pickle. But I’ll have a second job lined up in the next couple months. Then I’d be a second year on a community-based apprentice,”

“I’ve got a good relationship with all the bosses so I’m not going anywhere. I’ll probably just have to work as a sub-editor or something.”

However, our reporter spoke to another worker at the nearby Pisse Dans Ma Poche Cafe about what it feels like to be a young professional.

He’s a graphic designer by trade and he’s also a human being.

The 28-year-old said that he’s often frustrated by the fact that his job isn’t getting any younger and the demands of modern life are getting harder and more expensive.

“I just try to keep my nose out of the pool,” he said.

“And if I can get a second job, I’ll be OK. Because it’ll be nice to have a job where I’m not thinking about dying.”

Local Woman’s New Year Ration Plan Is Only Going To Help Her Feel Better

TEXT:

While her New Year’s Eve plans are looking to change dramatically, a local woman’s plan to only use the pills she took for two months to feel better is only going to help her feel better.

The Advocate sat down with Lucy French, a local woman, to talk about her decision to only take the pills she took for two months to feel better about herself.

“I think I’m getting more of a buzz from taking them,” said Lucy.

“I’m not sure, I’m just getting a good buzz from taking them.”

“I’ve been taking them for weeks now, it’s been a big help,”

“I can’t believe I haven’t been doing anything. I’ve only just left my flat in the city. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong, I’m wasting time.”

Lucy then told The Advocate that she was on her way to the shops and was about to buy something for her friends that she’d really like to have at home, but couldn’t because of her busy schedule.

“I’m going to make it home for dinner tonight, I’m sooooo excited.”

“I Was An Only Child, But Now I’m A Married One” Says Man Who Was Only Childed At A Time When Kids Were Less Important

TEXT:

A local man who was only a child when his parents divorced is today telling everyone he knows that he is a married man – because he is one of them.

After spending the last decade fighting a losing battle with his former wife and two kids, Francis Beaumont has decided that the only thing that really got him divorced was because he was an only child, but now he is a married one.

“I was never a single child, but it seems like everyone has forgotten that I was born into the wrong family,” the 44-year-old told The Advocate this morning via telephone.

“When my parents separated, my older brothers and sisters were around much more and had much more responsibility. It was a different time. The old man left the bank to start a small business and I didn’t even know what that was,”

“I’m a married man now, but yes, I was an only child. But, I’m a married one.”

The fact that Francis was raised in a home where only single children count as adults also means he is now an only child with a wife, which is a growing trend among Australian men.

However, as the number of only child’s rapidly increases, Francis’s story has been highlighted by popular blogs such as this one, which explain that he is a victim of the patriarchy and the natural selection.

Expert Finds Australia Has The Wrong Kind Of Access To Psychoactive Substances

TEXT:

A local medical professional has today given the nation a hardcover version of a report commissioned by the CSIRO into the appropriate levels of psychoactive substances for Australians.

The report, which is due to be published later this month, has found that the nation’s top users of the infamous ‘silver pills’, are those who’ve never used a psychotropic substance before.

Speaking from his boutique practice in Betoota’s Old City District, a local doctor, Dr. Richard Helmer says that the country’s current crop of top scorers in the Psychoactive Substances Index (PSI) are those people who haven’t ever used heroin, or alcohol, or PCP.

“These people aren’t the type of people who use drugs to numb the pain of a breakup or to relieve the post-concussion syndrome headaches that come from playing football at the end of a season,” he said.

“They’re the type of people who enjoy a good long night”

“They don’t seem to have any problems with the idea of killing someone with a sharp object,”

“They just don’t have the mental capacity to understand that it’s not a good idea to do so.”

However, the CSIRO report has found that this is not the only group of people who are affected by the new laws.

The highest users of amphetamine and methamphetamine, and those who often eat into the high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet, are also affected by the new laws.

The CSIRO have also found that these people are also the type of people who enjoy taking drugs on a regular basis.

“We know that people who enjoy taking drugs regularly are also the type of people that enjoy not doing drugs,” the CSIRO said.

“The fact that these people are also the type of people who like not doing drugs is also a strong indicator that the laws are a bad idea,”

“We’ve found that these people are also the type of people that enjoy a good night’s sleep, and the fact that they often have trouble with getting to sleep after a heavy night of heavy drinking, is also a strong indicator that the laws are a bad idea,”

“These people are the type of people we want in Australia,”

Greens Leader Richard Di Natale Calls For An Australian-Wide Ban On Mountain Dew

TEXT:

Sydney Greens MP, Richard Di Natale, has today called for Australia to ban the widely available and readily available product, Mountain Dew, stating that the drink is “dangerous” and “dangerous”.

This comes after hundreds of young people descended on Sydney this week to protest the idea of a local company buying up sodas and mints from supermarkets, to drive a stake through the life savings of hundreds of thousands of Sydneysiders.

“It is time to ban the most popular product in Australia,” Di Natale said at a press conference this morning.

“The research is clear – Mountain Dew is dangerous, dangerous, dangerous, dangerous, dangerous. It is a toxin in the right amount. It kills people, in fact, it kills people who drink it. It kills the brain. It kills the central nervous system. It kills the immune system. It kills the brain if you consume it regularly,”

“Now, I know that a lot of people drink Mountain Dew at home and enjoy taking part in this little rebellion, but I’m not going to sit idly by and watch people die, I’m going to take action.”

Di Natale then went on to describe how he plans to use the funds raised by the ban to start his own independent production of the product, and how he plans to pay for it.

“I’m going to get some research funding, some old-school-business-sense-of-the-day funding, and I’ll start making Mountain Dew. It’s going to be an honest, hard-hitting documentary about how dangerous this stuff is, and how we can make a dent in the rates of death amongst young people,” he said.

“And it’s not just me, it’s going to be the entire nation. It’s important that we find a way to get rid of this poison, because if you die from this stuff, you’re dead.”

State Of Origin: Man Who Got Caught On Tape For Going Full Hike Gets A New Helmet

TEXT:

A Betoota Heights man who got caught on camera while going full on hiked up his new helmet last night has been awarded a new one, after the local council decided to give him a bit of a lift.

Bill Sparrow, a 24-year-old who moonlights at a public servant, told The Advocate that he’s been to the shops a couple times and has ‘never had a problem with a bit of a push’ on his head.

But last night, something clicked inside him.

“I got a new helmet,” he said.

“The council decided to give me a lift because they think I’m the most fit bloke in the area,”

“So I thought, I’m not going full on anyway. I’m going to get a lift.”

Mr Sparrow then explained that he was thinking about getting a lift at some of the other places he’s been to.

He said he’s been to the Royal Betoota Hotel a few times and is a regular at the Royal Betoota Country Club.

“That’s where I’ve had the last few drinks,” he said.

“They’ll be the first to give me a lift if they see me going full on,”

“I mean, I’m not the first to do it, I’ve done it before and it’s fucked.”

“But I was the last one to do it.”

“It’s hard to get through a week without the kids knocking on my door asking if they’ve got a ball or something. That’s the reality of life as a non-counsellor-manager,”

In fact, it’s the first time he’s had to put the pedal to the metal with his wife, who told him that she’d be moving out at the end of the month.

He told The Advocate that she was a ‘pretty good, loyal, down-to-earth wife’ and that he was ‘trying to be a good dad.’

“I’m trying,” he said.

“But it’s hard. I’ve got a lot of work to do.”

Aboriginal Family Forced To Buy Upper-Middle Class Home After Unable To Find One

TEXT:

A group of Aboriginal children have today been forced to buy a house in the city, after being told that it’s unaffordable to live in the traditional owner’s property.

The children, who were born into families that were forced into the property by their white owners, are being forced to move into a city where they will be able to make a significant amount of money, by being born into a wealthy family.

The announcement came after the children were told that the house is unaffordable because it’s on a street that is predominantly occupied by people who don’t get out much.

“I just can’t afford to live here,” said one young mother.

“And I’m a single mother, I don’t get to see my kids play outside in the summer. This is just unacceptable,”

“I’ve tried to have the house on the same street as the schools, but they don’t want me to build anything.”

It’s understood that the children have been told that if they want to live in the traditional owner’s property, they will have to buy in the next few months, after the local council makes it clear that they aren’t going to pay any extra for the property.

While the sport has been popular for decades, it’s popularity is rising dramatically in recent years, as the number of people able to directly challenge the system and have their skills tested has increased dramatically.

The popularity of the game is also growing in the inner-state, with many young women in Bondi resorting to the sport at local events.

Adelaide Cuts To Chase And Replaces Local Man With Dumb Old Man Who Hasn’t Visited Their Local Supermarket

TEXT:

A local bloke who was promised a trip to the beach by the South Australian Government has been informed by his old man that he’s better than everyone else.

The old man, who has been in the local area for many years, is said to be ‘just fine’ with the local residents, after watching them regularly drop their prices on fresh produce and some of the local shops.

“I like the old boy” says the dumb old man.

“I’ve got a lot of respect for them”

“They don’t give a fuck about you old boy”

The local community has given the old man the benefit of the doubt, as they’ve said they’ll be looking after him for a while.

“The old fella has a good job, and I think he’s done a good job for himself” said one local man.

“He’s not a bad bloke, but. It’s tough luck mate, he’s done a good job of keeping the locals happy”

Local residents, however, have said that the old man should be happy for a change.

“He’s been around for a while, and he knows a thing or two about losing shit” said one local woman.

“He should have just walked away, he’s been a bit of a poon, and he should be fine with that”

Malcolm Roberts Calls For A National Election

TEXT:

NATIONAL LIBERAL LEADER Malcolm Roberts has come out swinging on the issue of an election, saying that he would be open to supporting a return to a republic if it meant the Australian people “had a change”.

In an effort to appeal to his more conservative supporters, the 64-year-old former federal senator has proposed a new system where all Australians would have to be eligible to sit in an election.

“I just don’t think there should be any legal or social hurdles whatsoever to a person getting elected,” he said.

“The only way it can happen is by a majority of the people voting,”

“I would be open to supporting a return to a republic if it meant the Australian people had a change.”

The former Liberal senator has since doubled down on his calls for an election, telling ABC’s Q&A live audience that he believes the country has gone to the point where a minority of Australians think democracy is a failure.

“I think we are at the point where we have a democracy where the people who want to see democracy fail have a majority,” he said.

“So I would be open to supporting a republic if it meant the Australian people had a change,”

“I think the people who want to see democracy fail should be voted out first and then another five years of the same,”

“That way, I’d be able to sit in a parliament house with my hands tied and have a vote on what to do with me.”

The Australian constitution sets out that the Australian people will elect a federal member for each of the four major parties. However, the Liberal Party has this year elected an upper house member, so it is unclear at this point how the Liberal Party will elect a Prime Minister.

This year, it is also unknown if the Liberal Party will elect a Prime Minister, but the party has been campaigning hard this week to secure the votes of the Liberal Party and the Liberal Party as a whole.

The ABC has reached out to the Office of the Prime Minister for comment but have yet to receive a reply.

New Study Finds It’s Pretty Much Exactly Like The Old Girl

A recent report by the Australian Bureau of Statistics has found that the typical Australian woman is basically the same as a 15-year-old boy.

The report concluded that the typical Australian male is:

A full head taller,

A fair bit stronger and

A fair bit heavier than the average male.

While the typical Australian woman is slightly shorter,

A fair bit smaller,

And generally just as skinny,

The Australian men are:

A fair bit smaller,

A fair bit bigger and

A fair bit more muscular than the average Australian female.

“It’s pretty much the same everywhere” says lead researcher, Professor Angela Capon.

“The Australian women are basically the same as the average Australian male. Except the Australian men are really short. The average Australian male is about 2.5 metres. That’s about 10% longer than the average Australian woman.”

Professor Capon’s findings have been confirmed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, who’s own statisticians have confirmed that the average Australian male is about 2.6 metres.

Fishing Industry Says All You Need Is A Good Wave And A Good Chance Of Rain

TEXT:

In years gone by, a big wave from a nearby wave dam was a good way to get the locals to turn up for a few days.

That was until a wave dam was built next to the wave dam, causing a major environmental impact.

Now the industry is calling for a new wave dam, because they can’t get out of the boat today.

“We’ve all heard it before,” said one local wave fisherman.

“That dam is good for a bit of a laugh, and a bit of a scare, but not for anything really. It’s just a good place to get some rain,”

“But if you get a big wave coming down the wave dam, you need to get out there and take it. Otherwise it’ll wash out onto the Goldie and the tide will come back up again.”

However, the environment is a bit more complex for wave fishermen, according to the World Wildlife Fund.

Last year, the organisation counted more than 2,000 large waves crashing into the wave dam – destroying its natural functions.

“It’s not a good look,” said one marine biologist.

“It’s a beautiful place, but it’s a beautiful place to destroy nature,”

“So don’t come in here, you won’t be getting much rain for a few months.”

ABC To Rename ‘ScoMo,’ To ‘Señor,’ In Effort To Make Up For Lack Of Top 40

TEXT:

In some breaking news out of Sydney today, the world’s most valuable media company will be making some changes to their current slogan.

The ABC, along with the rest of the world’s media, will be renamed from ‘The ABC,’ to ‘The ABC,’ in an effort to make up for the fact that they’ve been forced into a minor nickname due to their lack of media cachet.

The ABC will be renamed the ABC Television Centre, the ABC Digital Centre, and the ABC Digital City, among other titles.

As is tradition in regional Australia, most residents and business people are very wary of the ABC, especially their flagship news and current affairs program, Four Corners, and their correspondent, Leigh Sales.

However, this has not stopped the many thousands of residents that have been forced into wearing the ABC nickname due to their regional lack of media cachet.

Local Betoota resident, Debby Hoskins says she is not at all surprised by this, especially when it comes to the ABC.

“I mean, I know they have the best top 40 in the country, but I’ve been to a few spots in the state and it’s not like they’ve got a national program, it’s just ABC Radio, ABC News 24, ABC World News and ABC News 24.

“It’s got to be some bullshit, it’s gotta be. They are the ABC,”

However, the ABC has hit back at the claims that the ABC doesn’t exist, and says they’ll continue to present the ABC as a news and current affairs show.

“We’ve got the most diverse and exciting news and current affairs program on ABC, Four Corners, and we’ll continue to present the ABC as a news and current affairs show,” said the ABC’s director, Daryl Mckay.

“It’s a great example of ABC style, where you get real reporting from real people, with real problems and real challenges, like the plight of the struggling coal industry or the human rights abuses of young Indigenous people. It’s a real ‘ABC for people like you’”

They publish opinion pieces that appeal to young women, and then they edit them to fit their audience’s interests.

The Advocate has a well-known policy of being very hard to read – which is why many young women come to them with a basic understanding of what the internet is all about.

“I’ve just been trying to read the news, because I don’t like newspapers that don’t provide me with information that I can access through my phone”

“Like, I’m not sure how I got this thing all the way here, but I’ve been looking at it all morning”

“I’ve also been trying to read the FT, because I don’t like newspapers that don’t have opinion pieces that I can access through my phone”

It’s for this reason that this young woman is confident she’s been paying attention to the news, and that there’s nothing wrong with it.

“I’ve just been reading the FT because they’re so opinionated and opinionated. It’s so opinionated”

“It’s so opinionated, like, they’ve just said the same thing about the NBN and everything”

“That’s what I mean, it’s so opinionated”

“It’s the same with all the other news sources”

“They’re just so opinionated, it’s so opinionated”

“Like, they’re just saying this and that about the NBN and everything. It’s so opinionated”

The Advocate reached out to a number of other local women for comment but all of them were too busy to reply at the time of print.

Schoolies Now Confident They Can Get Away With Nothing This Time

TEXT:

THE SCHOOLIES have been given another scare this week as the verdicts of the Special Court of Australia come in.

The court is due to rule on Monday whether a group of former schoolies will be able to take the landmark case against the NSW state government this week.

The former schoolies, who won a collective $300 million in damages in the landmark case, say they are confident that they will get away with nothing.

“I’ve been working hard all week,” said one of the former schoolies.

“We’ve got the money, the lawyers and the means to do what we want,”

“I’m very confident that this isn’t the end of the line.”

The former schoolies have spoken to The Advocate today about their confidence that they can get away with nothing this time around.

One former schoolie told our reporters that he’s been trying to get an alibi for a few weeks now but has been unable to get a ride with the boys due to not being able to get a ride with the boys due to being a schoolie.

The alibi was that the boys were trying to get to for a while now.

“I told the boys I was a schoolie so they called me back,” said the alibi-by-statement.

“I got back and said ‘Fuck off, you weren’t a schoolie anyway’ and they laughed. So I told them I was a schoolie and they laughed. So I told the boys I was going to be a schoolie for a while,”

“Then they told me that I was going to be a schoolie forever. I mean, I’m not one of them but I’m not going to let this go unchallenged.”

The Advocate reached out to the NSW State Government’s Law Reform Office for comment but have yet to receive a reply.

Bloke Who Just Got Back From European Holiday In A Boxed Muffin Says He’s Not Exactly Excited For The Next 48 Hours

TEXT:

A local guy who’s just returned from a European holiday says he’s not exactly stoked for the next 48 hours.

While he’s not particularly excited about the idea of a boxed muffin for breakfast, he says he’s not like a lot of young Australians who’ve already had a holiday.

The 21-year-old from Betoota’s Old City District told The Advocate that he’s not overly excited about the next few hours.

“It’s not like I’m going to wake up in the morning and start drinking my coffee,” he said.

“But, yeah. I haven’t got time to just chill out. I’m going to wake up and get a job and get a house and that’s going to be the first day,”

“So yeah. I’m just not really feeling it at the moment. But if I do feel it, I’ll let you know.”

The Advocate reached out to the European Union for comment and received a detailed reply as to why their government is so keen on this country’s foreign holidays.

“I don’t think it’s that bad,” said the EU’s chief for the North.

“You know, it’s just a holiday, so it’s not like we’re forcing people to work outside. I mean, we’re all pretty much on European holidays, so it’s not like we’re forcing people to work in a factory for a whole year or something,”

“It’s just that, you know, if you’re not feeling it, you can get away with just a flat white. I mean, if you’re not feeling it, you can get away with just a flat white. But you can’t get away with a flat white, you know.”

“It’s Complicated” Says Australian Tech Industry

TEXT:

Australia’s technology industry has today thrown fuel on the fire by warning the country’s digital media and social media giants that they’re not going to stand for this type of crap.

“This is complicated, it’s messy” says the industry, which is largely made up of young white men.

“You need to have a clear path to innovation and growth”

“And I’m not talking about the quick get-go [sic] startups, I’m talking about the big companies with a proven track record of growing their businesses”

“This isn’t just the internet, this is all the big tech companies that have come down in the last few years. This is a warning to other media companies that if you don’t have a clear path to growth, you can’t be in the tech space.

“This isn’t just a warning that we need to diversify our businesses – this is a warning that we need to get to work”

“This is why we’re not just competing with the internet companies, we’re competing with the biggest media companies in the world”

Australia’s highest court strikes again to strike down Mabo’s bill

TEXT:

AUSTRALIA’S HIGH COURT HAS struck down the nation’s law that bars gay people from receiving the same legal protections as heterosexual people – a decision that’s left the nation in an uproar.

The nation’s highest court said the law is discriminatory, unconstitutional and unenforceable, and has ordered the federal government to prepare to repeal it.

The ruling came after a three-judge panel of the Court of Appeal decided that the state of Victoria’s law was discriminatory, unconstitutional and unenforceable, and ordered the federal government to prepare to repeal it.

Queensland’s law, which was passed in 2012, was struck down because it was unconstitutional because it was passed by a state parliament without the consent of the federal parliament, a federal court ruled.

The federal government appealed the ruling to the high court, which told the federal government to prepare to repeal the law.

But that’s left the nation in an uproar.

The Advocate spoke to a number of LGBTI rights activists this morning in Brisbane about the fallout from the high court’s ruling.

One was a legal adviser to the gay marriage equality movement, who spoke to our reporter about the emotions he’s felt since the law was struck down.

“I’ve been trying to get my period back,” he said.

“I mean, it’s been a hard week,”

“But it’s been a tough week. We’ve had the high court strike down our marriage equality laws, then we had a gay couple walk out of a gay marriage, which is just unacceptable. So now we have this high court strike down our same-sex parenting laws, then the gay couple have to walk out of a gay marriage, which is not what they’re saying,”

“It’s really hard to feel outraged by this. It’s like, we’re the fucking capital of this country, right?”

“I’m Not Afraid To Be Afraid” Says Low-Mid Range Auto-Med Student

TEXT:

In a news cycle dominated by white people being threatened by racism, low-mid-range auto-med student, Jeremy Morrison (21) has today taken it upon himself to tell people that he is not afraid of being different.

This comes after the young man was branded ‘racist’ and ‘bigoted’ by the NSW police, who claim he spit on a mosque in the early hours of the morning.

Jeremy says he doesn’t know who ‘the n-word’ is, but he knows who it is.

“I’m not racist,” he says.

“But I am a bit of a bigot sometimes.”

“So, yeah, I’m not afraid to be a bit of a bigot sometimes.”

Jeremy says he has never thrown rocks at cars or threatened to kill people.

“I’ve just never been that aggressive.”

Jeremy’s mum, Joce, says she understands that her son might have been a bit of a bigot, but he is a good kid and he is loved by his mum for being such a good kid.

“But, you know, he’s not a racist. He’s a good kid, but. He’s a good kid, but.”

Curry And Brown Bags To Travel To Italy For The Week Ahead

TEXT:

In a bold move, the two-time Olympic gold-medal winning cyclist, Michael Brown, has today announced his plans to take the next few weeks off, to travel to Italy for the upcoming Giro d'Italia.

The plan has been met with controversy, however, with many of his supporters claiming that he is risking a suspension from the sport, as well as a potential career-ending injury.

“It’s just not worth it” says Brown, in an exclusive interview with The Advocate.

“I’m not going to let the Italian Inquisition get me. I’m not going to let the Italians get me.”

“They’ve been trying to ban me for years. The FA Cup is the last thing I need.”

“So, I’ve decided to make a little diversion for the week.”

The Advocate reached out to the Italian Olympic Committee for comment but have yet to receive a reply.

However, a number of local Giro d’Italia organisers have come out in defence of Michael Brown, stating that he is risking a suspension and a possible career-ending injury, by travelling to Italy.

Local race organiser, Paolo Zempetti (72) says that if Michael Brown doesn’t take the next few weeks off, he’s in for a big year.

“I’ve got the honour of hosting him in the coming months. This Italian guy is a real show pony.”

“He’s just not human”

“He’s a real show pony. He’s not human. He’s a real Italian.”

West End Man Who Was At One Point On The Road To A Bigger Job Says He Didn’t Really Care What He Did In Life

A Betoota Heights local who was at one point on the road to a bigger role in life says he feels like he’s been left behind by a younger generation.

“I just felt like I was missing out on a generation,” said Shane Willis, a local communications professional who’s spent a fair chunk of time in the past few years on the West End’s major roads.

“Look, I’ve got a good job here, I’m not about to lose it, but I’m not exactly a rising star,”

“I guess I’m just a kid, a lost generation. Someone who’s never really had a chance to shine, you know what I mean?”

The 27-year-old spoke to The Advocate this afternoon as he slowly walked past our reporter’s office window, past the small group of young people sitting in the cold corner of the lobby.

“It’s sad,” he said.

“We’ve got a good job, it’s not like we’re billionaires or anything. It’s just a nice well-paid job, you know?”

“But the kids, they always want to ask me how it is going, how the fuck do you get on the road to a big house? Why don’t you just get a bigger job?”

“What’s the point of living if you don’t have any options?”

Our reporter said he thought about it for a moment and thought maybe he shouldn’t write that long-winded email.

Sex-Trafficking Industry Refuses To Assess The Scales That Private School Girls Must Use To Promote It

TEXT:

A recent report by the CSIRO has found that a lot of girls are being taken by unscrupulous people.

The study found that girls from low socio-economic families are often taken into the industry by people who are desperate for a chance to exploit them.

One of those girls, was Shara Beaumont, who was allegedly being trafficked out of her family home in the Sydney coastal city by a wealthy man who is a big supporter of the Australian Christian Lobby.

This comes as a new report into the sex trade has found that nearly all the girls are trafficked into the industry because they are really, really hot.

The CSIRO report, which has been in the making for some months now, says that a lot of the girls are really hot.

“These girls are really, really hot” said the CSIRO’s Dr. Theo.

“We’ve been able to establish that the demand for these girls is not just for the sake of prostitution, but for the sake of creating a supply for the industry”

“The demand for these girls is on a par with the demand for guns and ammunition for domestic security forces.”

“This is the same industry that says you shouldn’t be taking automatic weapons out of your garage, because they are so dangerous”

The CSIRO says that even with the high demand for these girls, there is a very limited supply.

“We’ve been seeing a very high demand for these girls, as well as a very low supply” said the CSIRO’s Dr. Theo.

“We’ve been seeing these girls come in and out of the industry quite often, with some of the girls actually going without being forced into it”

The CSIRO’s Dr. Theo says that the situation is much more complex than a school girl with a kiss shop.

Local Young Liberal Not Very Much Of A Liberal

TEXT:

A local Young Liberal, who has been publicly outed as a Young Liberal, has this morning given comment on the current state of Australian politics.

The 21-year-old member of the Betoota Grove City Limits Society Club told The Advocate that he’s never really been much of a supporter of either major party, ever since he first joined the society, and that he’s never really felt comfortable being an independent young man in the Liberal Party.

That’s led him to believe that the current situation within the Liberal Party is unsustainable.

“I just think that it’s a bit much, you know?” he said.

“The whole thing about the Liberal Party being a bit ‘un-Australian’ is a bit hollow, and a bit hypocritical, you know what I mean? Like, the entire thing is about making sure that we continue to allow foreign donations to the party and we continue to allow foreign speakers, and we continue to continue to allow foreign students to come and live in our country without fear of persecution because they’re Muslims,”

“But yeah, I’m a bit of a Liberal. I like all the things the party does. Like, I’m a bit of a reformer. But I’m not a lot of a liberal. I’m not a real conservative, so I guess I’m a bit of a ‘big tent’ leftie. But yeah, I’m not a very good Liberal.”

Australian Unemployed Considers Pushing The Button On His Bumbag And Getting A Job

TEXT:

Local unemployed man, Elliot Larsen (28), has today made the bold decision to get a job.

While he’s been out of work for a number of months now, the 24-year-old says he’s decided to take the job at the local convenience store because he’s been out of work for a number of months now – but because it’s cheap, and because he’s got a lot of friends who’ve quit, he’s decided to take it.

“Yeah, I’ve been out of work for like a year or so” he says.

“But I’ve been getting around the town doing odd jobs. Getting a coffee machine out of the cupboard or something”

Elliot says he’s been taking the job as a lunch attendant because he’s got friends that need to be in town, and because it’s cheap, and because he’s a bit of a local, and because he’s got a good relationship with a few of the town’s older people.

However, after a few months in the job, Elliot says he’s starting to think it might be a bit more difficult than he thought.

“I think I’ve got a bit of a chip on my shoulder” he says.

“Like, I’ve got a lot of hard hats, and I’ve got to be honest with you, I’ve got a fair few ‘em.”

“But I’ve also got a chip on my shoulder, like, I’ve got a chip on my shoulder because I’ve been out of work for like four months now. And I’m still getting by on my overtime,”

“Like, I’ve got a lot of friends that’ve quit their jobs to go on sick days, and I’ve got a mate that’s got a job but he’s still on his shit for Christmas,”

“Like, I’ve got a chip on my shoulder because I’ve been out of work for like four months now. And I’m still getting by on my overtime,”

Elliot says he’s starting to think he’s got a bit of a chip on his shoulder, like, because he’s been out of work for like four months now.

“Like, I’ve got a chip on my shoulder because I’ve been out of work for like four months now. And I’m still getting by on my overtime,”

“I’ve got a number of clients that I need to have in my shop but at the moment, Elliot is a customer. He’s never in a position of power over a customer. He’s a part-time apprentice car salesman,”

Australia’s Oddest Man Is A Local Man

Sydney man, Ricky Munro (27), is a weird duck.

While many of his friends are straight up funny, some of them aren’t. Ricky’s friends are straight up weird.

His new girlfriend, Shayleigh, says she doesn’t get why he doesn’t want to go on a trip with him, given he’s pretty much the only person on the planet who can understand his accent.

“I’m a different type of person, a bit odd”

With a strange accent, Ricky is unable to make out what is wrong with the culture of Australia, or Australia’s culture of oddness, as he calls it.

Sydney Man Accused Of Being A Cocky For Not Having A One-Hundred-Pound Footy Burger

TEXT:

A Sydney man has been accused of being a cocky for not having a one-hundred-pound Footy Burger at a Sydney pub.

“He’s not one of the boys” says one of his colleagues at the Diamantina Sports Bar & Grill on Sydney’s upper north shore.

“He’s not even a member of the football team. He’s a bit of a pussy”

The Diamantina Sports Bar & Grill is one of the city’s most exclusive and elite sporting clubs, boasting more than 1,000 members and counting over 300 members in its various clubs and associations.

The pub is notorious for their weekly snub-a-thon, where anyone can enter for as low as $50.

“It’s the type of thing where you need to be at least 6-feet tall to be considered cocky” says the barman.

“So we don’t let young men in here, we’ve got some real estate here”

The Diamantina Sports Bar & Grill has been the scene of some of Sydney’s most memorable nights.

In 2008, the pub hosted the biggest night of the year, when hundreds of young men showed up to a late night house party at the pub.

The night was so big that the owner of the pub had to hire a local plumber to try and get the toilet built, as the pub is essentially on top of a city sewer.

“The best part of the night was when we had to have the roof ripped out so we could have a flat tyre,” says the pub owner, who asked to remain anonymous.

“Then we had to have a roof replaced with a bed in it, which was also a bit of a pain, but we ended up just having to let out a big sigh when we found the spare tyre in it.”

However, the night was cut short by the arrival of a large group of pre-teens from the nearby Royal Hospital, who were drinking in the adjoining Ponds Pub.

“They were so pissed, they had the pub closed. The pub was so full of young men, I thought the pub would be locked up forever,” says the owner.

“But they had a crowd of about 20 young men around them, so I decided to let them stay until they got a better place,”

“It was a big win for us, they were coming to our pub for a piss and a blow.”

David Leyonhjelm backs Dan Murphy for NSW premier

TEXT:

Former PM and political mentor David Leyonhjelm has today thrown his weight around the NSW Liberal Party’s preference for new NSW Premier, Dan Murphy.

This comes after the Liberal Party’s leadership shake-up this week, as the party finally looks like they are capable of taking back the NSW state election from the Greens.

This comes after the Greens lost the election by a landslide, and have since been looking to take the state election in a different order.

With Leyonhjelm as NSW premier, the party is hoping that the experienced Liberal elite will be willing to put their weight around the party’s policies.

“I’ve got a few candidates in the pipeline for the NSW Liberal Party,” said Leyonhjelm.

“They’ve got a long way to go, but they’re looking good. I’m looking forward to having some input on the issues,”

“There’s a lot of young people, who are of a generation that voted for us because they didn’t really like the Greens – but they’ve been given a real mouthful of the old Coalition policy”

“The Greens need to be given a chance to win back their seats from the Liberal Party, and that’s where the Liberals are looking for a candidate,”

“David, do you think you’d be able to take them?”

“I think I’d be able to, but I’m not sure, and I’ve got a lot of candidates in the pipeline. If I don’t get the nod, then I’m going to go into politics myself.”

The Advocate reached out to the NSW Liberal Party for comment, but have yet to receive a reply.

Mum Feeling Cheated After Child She Loves Literally Has No Social Skills

TEXT:

Despite her best efforts, mum has come to terms with the fact that her youngest child, Elijah, has no social skills whatsoever.

The evidence of this comes in the fact that Elijah is completely lacking any form of social skills other than his absence during the week and his occasional tendency to start crying whenever he’s unhappy.

As a result, mum has resorted to finding ways to rationalise her child’s lack of social skills, such as through the use of euphemisms such as ‘kind’ and ‘nice’ and the occasional backhanded compliment.

“I guess he’s just not that social” says mum, who has spent the last 10 years trying to justify the fact that her child doesn’t know how to get along with other people, even after he’s spent 2 months at a local TAFE class.

“I mean, I love him, but he’s not very good at interacting with people and the fact that he doesn’t really like people at all, he’s just a weird kid”

“I guess he’s just not that social”

The fact that Elijah is the only child in the household without any friends or peers who has any form of a social life has been an issue for mum for the last 12 years, as she has tried to justify the fact that he is the type of kid who doesn’t get along with people.

“He’s always been this way”

“He’s never really had any friends… and he’s definitely not the type of kid who likes to hang out with people from school.”

Darren’s wife, Delilah, told The Advocate that she thinks he’s done something wrong.

Man Who Says He’s Afraid Of Flying In His Own Private Jet Is Sufficiently Intimidated To Ask For A Jet Skis

TEXT:

A local man who is scared of flying in his own private jet is enough to ask for a jet ski, it has been confirmed.

The man, who has never been to a fucking airport, and is just trying to make it through the next few months without a flight, has been revealed as a paranoid, self-hating coward who can’t handle being scared of flying, especially when it comes to a brand new, high-secred jet.

With his private jet, the type of jet that he’d take if he had to, there is a huge amount of personal responsibility that comes with, he says.

“I mean, I’m not scared of it, but it’s just a bit too big” he says.

“I’m not scared of it because I’ve got two kids at home, a mortgage and a job to do. I’m not scared of it because I’m a grown up”

“But because I’m a grown up, I’m scared of it,” he says while removing his sweatpants and walking through the airport baggage check, as a last resort.

“If I get a jet ski, it’s just like going on holiday, except I don’t have to worry about getting into an Uber, or any of that sticky shit. It’s a good option for a quiet weekend getaway.”

The Advocate reached out to the air hostess at the airport, to see if she’d be interested in speaking to our reporter about the man’s story.

“Oh yeah, I’m a bit of a jet ski kind of gal,” she laughed.

“So I’d be open to give him a bit of a nudge, if he’s interested in taking off his own jet ski.”

“Yeah, but I’d love to see him first.”

Clubs Annoyed That Young Bloke They Have Keep On Keeping The Same Job For 3 Months

TEXT:

A young man who is currently employed at a professional sports club has had to abandon his old job because the same employer has apparently made it clear that they don’t want him there anymore.

The young man, who has yet to complete a high school diploma, has been told by a few of the clubs he has been assigned has been making it clear that he will not be getting another job.

It’s believed that this particular employer has made it clear that they want a different kind of person, someone who is ‘a bit more of a challenge’ and someone who is ‘more like the old bloke’ – a job that is similar to the roles that young men are currently assigned in the AFL, NRL, A-League and now the NRL.

“I just thought I would have a bit of a say” said the young man, who is currently employed as a ‘back-row’ man for the Betoota Dolphins Rugby League Club.

“I don’t know what kind of a girl I would go for”

“I’ve got a few different jobs. One, I’m a DJ. That’s a bit more physical. That’s where I’d like to be. That’s where I’d like to be”

The Betoota Dolphins Rugby League Club president, Greg Hunt, says that this type of behaviour is not uncommon amongst the clubs.

“It’s not uncommon,” he said.

“There’s a certain type of bloke that comes to the club and just gets a job. That’s not our style of play”

“It’s not uncommon for clubs to have a few vacancies. That’s not our style of play”

ScoMo Takes The Next Step And Starts Talking About Coal Again

TEXT:

The Prime Minister of Australia, Scott Morrison, has taken the next step in his war on climate science denial and has today started talking about coal again.

The Liberal Party has been rocked by revelations that the Prime Minister has been in the habit of visiting the sites of Australia’s coal fired power stations, where he’s often seen talking to the operators about the dangers of the environment and the need to protect the environment from the coal.

“Coal is the future of this planet” he said, in a meeting with the local coal owners.

“It’s a war against the left, and we need to be prepared to fight for the future of this planet”

“Australia has a proud coal heritage, and we need to be vigilant in our efforts to protect it”

“That’s why I’m visiting these coal-fired power stations – because I want to see what the future holds for Australia”

The Prime Minister’s visit comes after his government announced it would legislate to allow the use of the Australian Aboriginal flag in all state government buildings, parks and daycares by the end of next year.

The flag currently flies at the Queensland State Government offices in Brisbane and Adelaide, but is also available as a flag on the Queensland Government website.

“It’s a symbol of Aussie pride, and it’s a very Australian thing to do”

“It’s a reminder that we are not a 1% or 2% nation, but a nation of over 90% Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people”

“We are one nation, united… And I want to say that to all the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, who’s been waiting patiently for this day for centuries”

The Prime Minister then turned to the LGBTI community, and the more progressive community, and asked them to pray for him and for Australia.

“I ask that you pray for me and for Australia. I ask you to pray for me, because this is Australia, and we need to be as progressive as possible, even if it means taking down the flag”

“If you see any of you queers praying this morning, I’m going to have to hit you with the shovel”

“It’s not my fault, I’m just trying to be as left as I can”

“We’ve Got To Save This Place!” Sparks Riots In Sydney’s Lower North Shore

TEXT:

A riot squad has arrived in Sydney this afternoon to restore order, after hundreds of police were forced to shoot and kill a number of inmates attempting to remove a Confederate flag from a venue that was playing host to the nation’s highest-selling punk album, Antichrist Superstar.

The shooting occurred just before 9 pm local time, in Sydney’s Upper North Shore.

Police were called to the scene after reports of an African man being dragged from the venue, and then shot.

Local resident, Jackson Thornhill says he was at the scene when the African man was brought in, and that he saw him being dragged from the venue, then dragged back into the venue, where he was again shot.

“He was trying to get us to take it down, then he was shot in the back of the head,” says Thornhill.

“I’ve heard the commotion, and I looked up to see the African man lying there on the ground, covered in his own blood,”

“I grabbed his hand, and pulled him up. I’m not a dog-puncher, I’m a dog-puncher. I’m sorry for shooting him,”

“I’m not even that bad of a bloke. I’m just really into the music, and this place is really fun.”

The shooting has left the area in lockdown, and the victims are currently being treated in a critical but stable condition.

The victim’s names have yet to be released, but police are appealing to the public’s help in identifying the African man.

Police are urging anyone with information to contact them by calling Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or by sending information online via crimestoppers.com.au; which people should be aware is a police operation.

Police remind people they should not report crime information via their Facebook and Twitter pages.

The Opposition Leader was yesterday called upon to defend his ideas and policies on climate change, immigration, and the use of private schools.

It is believed that the Prime Minister was furious that the Opposition Leader used the press conference to promote his own ideas and policies.

“He was just there to make sure we aren’t having a media scrum. I don’t care if you don’t agree with me, I am a Prime Minister and I am here to defend my ideas,” said the PM.

Brisbane Residents Pleased To Not Hear Any More Of The Tragic Death Of BJJ

TEXT:

THE PROPERTY OF BJJ has been completely ruined in Brisbane, as the city prepares to implement the strictures of the sport in a much-needed “fix”.

The new sport of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu has been a death sentence for many years, as the city is forced to pay dearly for the reputation it has earned.

In particular, the reputation it has earned for not only allowing the occasional violent and immoral riot, but also for being the only city in the country where it is completely legal to kick the head.

However, with the Queensland Government today announcing that the sport will be completely legal in the state’s capital, it seems that the Rio Olympics is now a distant memory of the past.

Local resident, Shaynna, says she’s been watching BJJ for years, and is so glad no one is dying, but still.

“I’ve got to say, I think it’s great for the game to be made illegal,” she said.

“I’ve got three kids under the age of 10 now, and I’ve seen them fighting it out on the front lawn of a house, I’ve seen them getting punched and kicked – but I’ve never seen them die.”

“I think it’s a good thing for the game to be made illegal. I’m not a legal person, but this sport kills me.”

However, the Queensland Government have today told the Advocate that they’re not particularly interested in the sport being made illegal.

“We’ve told them to get their hands off our property,” said a spokesperson.

“Our children are far too smart to be involved in this sport. We’re not going to allow them to fight on the streets, so we’ll have to put them in the care of the local police.”

“But yeah, I’m still waiting for the Gold Coast. They’ve got a really nice car, but I’ve got a little thing for my boys. They’ve got a really nice car but I’ve got a little thing for them,”

The retired accountant then goes on to explain that he’s spent a lot of time with his boys in the AFL and that he’s just come to the conclusion that it’s something he needs to do because he’s not getting any younger.

“They’ve been telling me this for years,” he says.

“So I just thought, why don’t I just become a police Constable?”

“Because I’ve got a little thing for you boys, because you’ve been telling me this for years. So here I am.”

As the conversation drags on, Scott Winslow realises he’s just made a huge mistake.

He’s told his son he’s thinking about joining the police force because he’s actually had a pretty good run with the boys.

“I mean, I’ve got a couple of serious run ins with the boys, you know what I mean?” he says.

“They’ve been calling me over the last few weeks, asking me if I wanted to come and help them out. So I said sure, what do you reckon?”

“I mean, I’ve got a pretty good relationship with the boys, but yeah, I’m thinking about going down to the Gold Coast. That’s where they’ve got a good base.”

“I’m not too keen on the long hours, but the kids are really good at sport and stuff. So yeah, I’ll give them a crack.”

Woman Who Had Nontending Pregnancy And Was Prepared To Have A Baby By Local Dad Says She’s Not Ready

TEXT:

A local woman has taken the time out of her busy morning of answering emails and typing on her smartphone to voice her opinion on the current state of the nation and the world. 

The young mother of three from the small farming community of Betoota Grove, told The Advocate today that she’s been waiting for some time for some form of a baby announcement and that she’s not ready to have a baby. 

“It’s just not right,” said the woman. 

“Because you’ve got all these people telling us that our nation is going through some kind of crisis, and that I’m not ready for a baby,” 

“I mean, you’ve got all these left-wing people saying that we should be relaxing about the fact that we’re all dying, but you can’t even say that to people who are old enough to understand the concept of dying.” 

“So it’s a bit hard for me to say that I’m ready to have a baby, to be honest, but I’m not ready to have a girl or a boy, either.” 

“So, you know, that’s what I’m thinking.” 

The Advocate reached out to the local baby boomers for comment but have yet to receive a reply.

Queanbeyan Man Can’t Wait To Start Buying A House

TEXT:

A prominent local man from the city’s inner city has had a nervous breakdown this morning, after being asked to buy a house on the cheap.

The local water carrier, Jack Pearson, told The Advocate this afternoon that he’s never had a house on the cheap before.

“You just have to ask for it,” said the 29-year-old.

“I mean, if I wanted one, I’d be paying about $12000 a week in rent, but you can’t even get one that’s on the market at the moment. You’ve gotta ask for it,”

“I’ve got a deposit on a house, but it’d be nice to have the option to buy one when I need one, not just when I need it.”

The Advocate reached out to the nearby rental companies and how they’d gone about getting people like Jack.

The short answer was that they’d all gone broke with the rest of us.

However, the second part of that answer was that Jack was just asking for it because he’s a grown up.

“Yeah, but look. I don’t want one. It’s just not my price,” said the young man.

“It’s not a big city house, you know what I mean? Not a big enough for me to live in and not be forced into buying a house on the cheap,”

“So yeah, I’ll be buying one for a reasonable price when I need it. Then if that’s your price, I’ll buy it.”

“Fucking Idiot” Says Man Who’ll Never Own A Toyota Prius

TEXT:

A man who’s never owned a Toyota Prius has lashed out at the car industry this morning, saying that it’s ‘idiot’ and ‘fucking idiot’.

That’s according to his mum, who’s never driven one and only once’s she was a high school girl who was in a group of friends that drove one.

However, the 47-year-old former city worker took the time to speak to The Advocate this morning, saying that he’s always been a little bit sceptical of the Prius – and that kind of makes him feel a little bit threatened.

“It’s a fucking idiot,” he said.

“The Prius has some of the worst safety record of any car on the market right now. It’s the fucking idiot. You’d have better odds getting into a group of friends who drive Volkswagens down the road than the odds are that you’ll be able to drive a Prius into a fire tunnel.”

“You know what I’m talking about. The Prius is a fucking idiot. It’s the fucking idiot. I’m talking about owning one.”

Our reporter reached out to a number of other local government officials to see what they thought about the man’s claims and what they thought of them.

From the moment they were elected, they’ve been very clear that they’d like to see the Prius go the way of the Volkswagen Golf and the Civic, and that it’d be a great car for young people.

Normal, Stable, Drug-Free Female Swimmer To Be Replaced By ‘Normal, Stable, Drug-Free Male Swimmer’

TEXT:

A female swimmer is being replaced by a male swimmer, in a bold attempt to become the first non-narcissistic female swimmer to win an Olympic medal.

The Australian Olympic Committee confirmed this morning that the nation’s peak aquatic body is looking to replace the nation’s oldest and most storied institution, the Sydney Swimmers, by a new, more ‘normal’ female swimmer.

The announcement comes after more than a decade of debate and controversy surrounding the swimmer in question, with more than 80,000 complaints received from around the world over the last few years.

The changes come after the nation’s peak aquatic body began to look to replace the Sydney Swimmers with a more ‘normal’ female swimmer, in the wake of the Rio Olympics.

“We can confirm that the AOC has decided to replace the Sydney Swimmers with a more ‘normal’ female swimmer, in order to avoid the issues that arose from their inclusion in the first place,” a spokesperson for the AOC said in a statement.

“The decision was made after close consultation with a number of different groups, including the community, the community swim clubs and the community swim teams, as well as with the members of the community themselves,”

“As we’re no longer in competition with the Swimmers, we’re not in competition with the Swimmers, and therefore we’re not in competition with Sydney Swimmers.”

“The AOC will be holding a press conference on Friday morning to explain the new AOC rules regarding gender.”

The Sydney Swimmers will continue to host world-class female athletes from Australia and around the world in their venues and community halls, but the new AOC rules will see them take away their ability to host athletes from other countries.

Sexist Supermarket Ads Are Still A Thing

TEXT:

The most disgusting and disgusting advertisements for the nation’s supermarkets have been spotted for the first time, it has been confirmed.

These ‘sexist’ supermarket advertisements are still a thing after years of being published on the internet, despite the millions of people who have either never read the article or watched it on TV.

The commercial’s depiction of women being treated like second-class citizens by a super-rich and sexist supermarket lobby has been around for a while, but has never been seen in the flesh – until now.

One local man, who we will refer to as ‘Bryson’ says he was always wary of the supermarket lobby, but recently found himself engaging in a bit of the ‘vegan’ stuff.

“Yeah, I just thought I’d let them know I’m a vegan,” said Bryson.

“So I started going to the farmers markets. I’ve been going to the fairs, the city fairs, everything. I’ve even gone to the beach with the girls,”

“It’s really good. So I’ve been going to the beaches with the girls, too. I don’t even get sun, it’s too cold outside!”

We reached out to the supermarket lobby for comment and they told us that they don’t comment on individual campaigns.

The Advocate spoke to some of the other members of the supermarket lobby, who all said they’d heard about Bryson’s new campaign and thought he should be commended for his bravery in the face of adversity.

One member said he’d been going to the beaches with his girlfriend and his girlfriend’s friends for years and he’d never heard anyone talking about Bryson’s campaign until now.

“Yeah, I know he’s a vegan, but I’ve never seen him wearing a shirt that says ‘Paleo’ before,” said the member.

“That’s pretty impressive, I’m impressed. He probably has a skin the colour of a jockey’s bell.”

Report: Small Island Migrants Taking It Up A Few Notches

TEXT:

A recent report by the CSIRO has found that the majority of small island migrants who have settled in Australia since the early 1800’s, are taking it up a few notch’s.

This comes after the nation’s small island communities were rocked by a spate of violent crimes that have seen some of the locals murdered.

The CSIRO says that while some of the crimes are extremely tragic, it’s hard to categorise the whole thing as an act of terror because there is not really any obvious signs of a political or social uprising.

The report found that most of the crimes were committed by young, mostly male, men who are not in any way associated with the local community.

“They are just doing it to have a crack at the big time” said one CSIRO researcher.

“You can’t really blame them for anything”

“They are just plain basking in the sun”

Local Man Saves The World From His Poor Opinion On MAFS By Talking To Coworkers Who Have No Problem With Him

TEXT:

The MAFS has been an abject failure.

But, as the poll results show, there is still a large segment of the Australian electorate who enjoys the show and those people are the type of people who don’t mind a bit of banter.

One such conversation took place in the dining area of The Lord Kidman in the French Quarter this morning where local man Glenn Miller had just watched MAFS with his wife.

“I didn’t know it was such a hit with these young fellas” he said.

“It’s like, the only thing that MAFS does is they just make people feel like they are really on the money and intelligent. Like they know what they are doing. It’s like, a great way to show the country that you are smarter than the MAFS crowd.”

“But I don’t like it. You know what I mean. MAFS is boring. So boring. I don’t think you should be on it, you know what I mean?”

Glenn then took a sip of his medium-rare Betoota Bitter and looked at his wife.

She looked at Glenn.

“Oh my God,” she said.

“Is that what you think?”

Glenn shrugged.

“Well, it’s like they don’t even know what they are talking about. They just make you feel smarter because you’re on the show. That’s my opinion.”

His wife smiled and said she had no problem with him drinking this Betoota Bitter.

Mum Feeds The Boyfriend For The 3rd Time This Week

“He’s gonna have to watch this,” she said.

“He’s gonna have to drink it,” said her husband.

“He’s not fucking around.”

That’s the message that Sam Sasse, of Betoota Grove, has sent his girlfriend this morning after she fed him a third time for a very obvious reason.

Sam, who’s currently stuck at home with his parents because he’s not good enough at his job, is finally getting the hang of the occasional feeding.

He’s been trying to feed his girlfriend Laura, who he thinks is a bit dirty, for three weeks now, and every time he tries to give her a drink she just retorts with a short ‘How dare you spoil me!’ and a few choice insults.

“It’s not that he doesn’t like her, it’s just that he’s not good at feeding himself,” said Sam.

“I just don’t like being spoiled by someone who has never fed themselves before. It’s a new skill for him,”

“Laura, I know you’re good at feeding yourself but fuck me, feed me. It’s not fair.”

Laura, who says she’s a bit shocked that Sam has the gall to even suggest that he feed himself, says it’s just that he’s always had a problem with the concept of feeding himself.

“I just think he needs to learn some other skills. He’s fed himself three times this week and he’s gonna have to learn the rest,” she said.

“I’m not even that good at feeding myself so he’s not gonna be able to feed himself when he’s old,”

“He’s got to learn how to feed himself properly.”

Woman’s Weekly Opinion Contests With The Claim That She’s A Big Fan Of The Suburbs

TEXT:

Local woman, Sarah, has been under the impression that she’s a big fan of the suburb’s, after she voted for the local Liberal MP, who she claims to be a big fan of, and who is also a really big fan of the suburbs, in an attempt to test her theory.

The theory goes that Sarah is a big supporter of the idea that large, inner-city suburbs have a large Jewish community, and is therefore very supportive of the idea that the Liberal Party is somehow tied to the interests of large, inner-city suburbs, in a way that other forms of politics are not.

The fact that Sarah is not Jewish, or Jewish at all, but a completely different ethnicity to the people she grew up with, is one of the most interesting and intriguing aspects of the theory, as it relates to her own personal experiences.

“I’m not Jewish,” she says.

“I’m Jewish in the suburbs, and I’m also a big fan of their suburbs,”

“So I’m testing these theories by voting for the Liberal Party.”

The theory has been met with a number of criticisms, which include the fact that the area that Sarah is from is not actually representative of Australia’s suburbs, but rather the suburbs of people who are from those areas.

“Mate, I’ve got no idea what suburb you are talking about. The suburbs I’m from aren’t suburb of people who live in them, they are suburbs of people who live in them…”

“So, to answer your question. I don’t know, I’m not a big fan of suburbs”

“I’m from a suburb of people who live in them”

“Mate, you don’t know what suburb you are talking about. I’m from a suburb of people who live in them”

Daily Mail Readers All Desperate For The News That A Newspaper That Promotes Anarchism Has Told Them It’s OK To Be White

A group of Daily Mail readers have hit out at the tabloid newspaper’s recent decision to run an article by disgraced former Liberal Party staffer James Ashby as their election coverage.

The decision has left the readers upset, with many taking to social media to vent their frustrations.

One reader, who we’ll call Beth, said she’s been following the Daily Mail religiously since it first started printing the remains of a Labor Party policy paper.

“The Daily Mail has for many years been a leading voice in the Australian media landscape,” she said.

“However, they have today revealed themselves as a media organisation that promotes the politics of division and hatred,”

“The same goes with the Daily Telegraph, they have a long history of promoting the politics of division and hatred.”

“They’ve got the perfect coverage for the current leadership crisis in the Liberal Party, the perfect coverage for the current leadership crisis in the Turnbull Government,” he said.

“So I’m upset that Daily Mail Australia, the paper of record, decided to run a story about James Ashby,”

“I’m sure he’s a fine person and he’s a decent politician. But a man needs to be judged by his actions, not his words.”

Aboriginal Man Not Sure Why Black People Aren’t Interested In Him

Aboriginal people have been left feeling left out by the newly left-wing media commentators who are now parroting their agenda, it has been confirmed.

“I’m interested in what it’s like being a minority in Australia.”

Former PM Tony Abbott claims to have seen the light

TEXT:

Former Prime Minister Tony Abbott has finally come clean and admitted that he was wrong about his claim that he saw the light in the gay marriage debate.

This comes as the former PM has been forced to defend his controversial comments that the Coalition should not be pushing for same-sex marriage, despite the overwhelming majority of Australians in favour of the idea.

Abbott, who made the comments in an interview with ABC journalist Tony Jones, said that he was now willing to apologise for his comments, and explain how his views have changed.

“I think the gay marriage issue is over,” said Abbott.

“It’s settled, it was settled in the last parliament. It was a no-brainer. It was a no-brainer for all those Liberal voters in my electorate who supported it,”

“I mean, if gay marriage is settled, then gay marriage will happen. It’s just a matter of when and where it happens. The Liberal Party has no business legislating when and where gay marriage will happen. That’s my view,”

“Just as long as we can find a way to keep the Catholic Church from interfering with our ability to provide for our families and to provide for our children. Just as long as we can get the government to stop interfering with our ability to do that,”

“Just as long as we can keep the Catholic Church from interfering with our ability to provide for our families and to provide for our children,”

Abbott then went on to explain that the Coalition’s position on gay marriage has not changed since he was last in Canberra.

“So, in fact, my view hasn’t changed that much since I was last in Canberra,”

“I’ve always been that one who says, ‘we need to be a bit more conservative,’ but now I’m the one who says, ‘we need to be a bit more progressive,’ and I’ve been in Canberra a few times and I know that I’m a bit more progressive than the other two Liberal Party senators,”

“It’s just a matter of time.”

Mr Abbott then went on to explain that he is now very much looking forward to the day when he will be the first sitting Prime Minister to have to face a press conference.

“I’ve been thinking about that, my old man,” he said.

“He’s been telling me over the last few months that he’s looking forward to a day when he has to face a press conference because it’s going to be a big day in Canberra for him,”

“I’ve been thinking about that, too,”

“No, It’s Not Delicious” Asks Woman Who’s Just Found A Box Of Kraft Macarons

TEXT:

It’s a beautiful afternoon in the French Quarter and a friendly local salesperson is making a point of stopping every conversation she’s in with the subject of her conversation.

“No, it’s not delicious” says Sharni Pearson, who’s just found a box of Kraft Macaroons.

“It’s not that bad”

This comes after Sharni found a box of Kraft Macaroons in a local takeaway shop, as well as a few packets of instant coffee, a couple packets of Tamara sauce and a box of Kraft Cheez.

The Advocate caught up with Sharni after she was back in the French Quarter.

“I just thought I’d have a bit of fun with you”

“You’ve got to let me know when you’d like to buy some Kraft Macaroons”

“I’ve found a box of Kraft Macaroons, I’m going to get a box of Kraft Macaroons and a packet of instant coffee. That’s pretty much like getting a packet of instant coffee and a box of Kraft Cheez,”

“If you’ve got a box of Kraft Macaroons, you’ve got to give it to me now,”

“I’m going to try to get a box of Kraft Macaroons and a packet of instant coffee,”

Sharni’s husband, John Pearson, says he’s not overly concerned about his wife’s behaviour, but rather her behaviour, in general, is something that he is more than happy with.

“It’s very easy to get a box of Kraft Macaroons and a box of instant coffee in the same week,”

“I’ve got instant coffee and Kraft Macaroons in the same week,”

“She’s not a bad girl, she’s just a bit of a sissy”

“I don’t think she’s a bad person, I just think she’s a bit of a bitch.”

The Not-So-Secret Relationship Between The Australian Labor Party and The Opposition

TEXT:

Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has given a press conference today in Canberra, where he made it clear that he is not happy with the ALP being treated like this.

“In my time, the ALP was like a single-issue party,” he said.

“In fact, they were the only party who believed in climate change,”

“I am a Labor Prime Minister and I am the only one who believes in climate change. But I don’t believe in climate change, either.”

When asked by reporters if he thought the ALP was taking the piss, Turnbull said he didn’t.

“I don’t think they care about the environment, climate change, or the future of this country,” he said.

“I think they’ve been indoctrinated by the Liberal Party into thinking that Labor is the party of the left,”

“I’m not a conspiracy theorist, I just think Labor is a party of the left.”

“They are a party of the wealthy and the corporations. The ALP are the party of the common man.”

NRL Players Speak Out On Issues That Affect Them Most

TEXT:

Former NRL players have hit out at the media and NRL fans today, saying that they’re sick of being treated like second-class citizens for being just like everyone else.

The statement comes as the players and club look to the upcoming Grand Final as a chance to kick-start the next NRL season.

“I’m not one of the boys, I’m not a fucking loser,” said one player, who played for the Gold Coast from 2000-2005.

“But the fact that we have to play a team that’s exactly the same as our team, I mean, it’s just unfair. It’s like the NRL is telling us that we have to play like them, instead of like them playing,”

“It’s fucked, mate.”

The entire NRL community has come out in full support of the players, with most players and staff writing on their Facebook and Instagram profiles that they’re ‘100% behind the boys’ and the club.

Another player, who played for the Gold Coast from 2000-2005, spoke to The Advocate about the issues he’s most concerned with right now.

“I mean, the off-field stuff, the lack of professionalism and the general shittiness of the team,” he said.

“But, you know, I’m most worried about the off-field issues that affect me the most. Like the lack of cohesion and the general unprofessionalism of the club. The players are a bunch of pussy bores, you know what I mean? They’re not fit to play a game of rugby league. There’s no excuses,”

“So, yeah, I’m most concerned about the off-field issues that affect me the most. Like the lack of professionalism and the general shittiness of the team,”

“But yeah, it’s probably not the players fault. Maybe the players are to blame. It’s a bit unfair, it’s like the NRL is telling us that we have to play like the players, instead of like them playing,”

“But yeah, it’s probably not the players fault. Maybe the players are to blame. It’s a bit unfair, it’s like the NRL is telling us that we have to play like the players, instead of like them playing,”

“I’m Not That Old” Says Man Who’s Never Left The Territory

TEXT:

A local man who has never left the state of his birth certificate has today told his mates that he’s not that old.

The fact that he’s said that to his mates for the last 10 years has been a common enough find amongst the outback town’s young people, but it’s the most striking aspect of his personality that has made him stand out.

“That’s why I’m not that old” he says, in a nonchalant tone that only a 20-something who’s been in the same room as you for the last decade will pull off.

The fact that he’s never been in a position where he could be the head of a large family, or that he’s never been in a situation where he could be on a public platform with the consequence of his actions, is what really makes him different.

“I’m not that old” he says, in a way that makes you question if he’s even that old.

“I’ve been out here a bit longer than the rest of them”

“Yeah but. You know what, I’ve been out here a bit longer than most of them”

“I’ve got a real chip on my shoulder. I’m not one of those people that just falls for the old man’s every word. I’m not one of those people that just lets the older blokes speak for him. I’m not that old”

However, most of his mates say that they’re not too keen on his new lifestyle, and say that he’s not exactly a fit bloke for the bush.

“It’s just not for him, he’s not the type of bloke you’d want around. Especially when he’s got a lot of chins and a really big frame”

Local Woman Can’t Find The Words To Condemn Her Behaviour

TEXT:

A young local woman has had to resort to using her fists and the words of the Lord’s Prayer this afternoon after she learnt she had made a mistake.

Melanie Dawn, a Betoota Grove social media manager at the firm, says she is feeling very sorry for herself and the reason she did it.

“I just thought I’d go to the gym and come back here and have a few shonks at the bar. It’s not like I am a big supporter of social media, I just love it,” Dawn told The Advocate via telephone this morning.

“So I thought I’d spend a couple of minutes apologizing to the people of Australia and tell them that I’ve made a mistake,”

“I’ve even taken the liberty of telling them that I’m not a bad person.”

The Advocate reached out to Dawn’s employer, the private asset management firm of McGuire & Putnam, for comment but have yet to receive a reply.

However, we did send Dawn’s family and friends who are in contact with her to ask them what they thought of her performance.

One of Dawn’s close friends told our reporters that she didn’t think she’d make it through to the next level but that doesn’t matter because she’s got the whole family here.

Cotton Grower Fuming At Australia’s New Carbon Tax

TEXT:

A prominent Australian cotton grower has taken to social media this morning to vent her frustrations at the nation’s new carbon tax.

Betoota Heights-based cotton grower, Haydon Batten, spoke to The Advocate via telephone where she explained that she’s been noticing a decrease in production in her region over the last few months.

“It’s almost like the croceas has been given to me,” she said.

“My crop isn’t producing as much as it used to. It’s almost like I’ve been living in a dream world,”

“But it’s not just my crop. My neighbour’s and I’ve all been getting the same thing,”

“I’m not alone. Every cotton grower in the Diamantina has been getting shafted by this carbon tax.”

The Advocate reached out to the Office of the Prime Minister for comment but have yet to receive a reply.

However, one local grazier we spoke to said he’s glad this issue is now out in the open.

James Cook, of Cook City Downs, said that he’s been noticing a decrease in the quality of cotton in his area for some time.

“I’ve been watering the place with a garden hose for the past couple of years,” he said.

“When I first started watering the place, the area was pretty rough. You’d get a bit of a pebble out on the edge of the cul-de-sacs, you know, just like you’d get out of a rough-and-tumble footy field. But then the carbon tax came in and basically gave me a flat-fee for every cotton square foot,”

“Pretty slick.”

“Just Say No To War!” Says Man Who’s Had 11 Years To Plan For This

With the impending threat of nuclear war now real, a local man has today made a bold declaration – by stating that he has had eleven years to plan for this.

This comes after the 44-year-old retired accountant made the bold declaration during a phone call with his partner of ten years this morning.

The call was made at 11:59 AM, as the couple were finishing up their meal at the local Korean fusion restaurant.

“Just say no to war!” says Brad, after being told by his partner that she had a reputation for being a bit too hands-free in the past.

“I’ve been planning this for a while, and I’ve actually just been having a bit of a break from the usual, you know. I’ve just been doing some real research.”

The conversation took a dramatic turn, however, when Brad began to tell his partner that he’d been planning this for a while.

“Yeah, I mean, I’ve been thinking about it for a while, you know. I mean, we’ve been thinking about it for a while, you know.”

“So when you say ‘no’ to war, I know that I’ve had eleven years to plan for this,” he said.

“And I’ve actually been doing some real research. I don’t just sit there and wait for the world to go to war, I’m planning for it.”

“I’ve been doing real research on this issue, you know. I’ve actually been reading up on some of the stuff that’s out there now, you know.”

“You know what, this is really bad. We’ve been having a lot of conversations about this, you know.”

“Man, I Don’t Get What I Do With My Life” Says Australian With No Career Background

A 27-year-old Australian man who is known to have a rough go of things, has today revealed his reasons for going without a car for a year and a half.

“I don’t get it, why do I have to do this to myself,” he said.

“You know, the whole reason I’m doing it, to be honest. I mean, I’ve got a good job, I have a house, I have a girlfriend… Why do I have to do these things? Why is this happening to me?”

“Man, I don’t get it. Why am I not able to own a car, or work in finance or anything that has a purpose. I don’t understand,”

“I mean, I’ve got all these cool things I can get excited about, like my family and my job… But, I don’t have a reason to do these things.”

The reasons why Benji is unable to own a car, or work in finance or anything that has a purpose, have been confirmed by his dad, who says that he’s pretty much the only other person in his family that is qualified to give out loans to people on the street, and that’s pretty much it.

Colin Rogers, a third generation dairy farmer, told The Advocate this morning that he’s not going to be able to go ahead and give up his beloved sheep, because it’s his livelihood.

“I’m just not going to,” he said.

“They’ve got a few things they’ll have to go through before they’re finished,”

“But yeah, I’m not gonna be able to get out to work this year, because the drought is really bad,” he said.

“If it wasn’t for the sheep, I’d have to give up my property. But the fact is, I’m not going to. So that’s what I’m going to do.”

The 28-year-old fired up by the plight of his beloved cows, said he’s going to start looking for work.

He spoke to The Advocate this morning through clenched teeth and a syringe on the side of his head.

“I’ve been thinking about it,” he said.

“I don’t know, maybe I’ll give up my property and move to another area. But I don’t know, I’ve got a nice property, I’ve got a nice part of the town to work in. But it’s not like I’m gonna give up my sheep, either.”

“It’d be nice to have some work. But, you know, I’ve gotta have a couple of my sheep to feed and I can’t work without them.”

“Gotta Go!” Says One Nation

One Nation leader, Pauline Hanson has reportedly been trying to keep an eye on the remaining members of the far-right faction of the far-right faction of One Nation, The American Freedom Party (AFP).

The efforts appear to be ongoing today, as the party continues to gather momentum ahead of the expected leadership spill this year.

While the AFP has had a tough few months, it appears they have come a long way since their earlier days.

Brisbane City Council Should Release Dogs From City Lock Up In Surplus Nauru And Nauru Detention Centres

TEXT:

The Kings Of Australia’s most senior politicians are calling for a review of the Brisbane City Council’s decision to release dogs from the city’s lock up centres, saying they should be put back on the streets and not just sent back to Nauru and Nauru detention centres.

The review comes after a series of poor decisions by the council, with the release of dogs from the city’s detention centres costing the taxpayer close to $2 million.

“It’s a tragedy,” said the Mayor, who’s own dog is a 10-year-old pit bull mix.

“The dogs are not doing any good. I’m not sure why the council feels the need to take them into custody at all. Perhaps they’d be better off being sent back to their home country, where they’re more likely to be killed by a bullet to the brain or something,”

“I’m not sure, either. It’s a hard, emotional decision for me to make, you know. I’ll have to have a frank chat with the council members and the residents of Brisbane about it.”

The Mayor’s comments come as the City of Brisbane has today revealed that it has spent close to $2 million on this year’s elections – which has prompted questions about what the money was used for.

“It’s a complex issue,” said the Mayor.

“The bottom line is, these dogs were not released to the public for any valid reason, and they are not doing anyone any good. I don’t think it’s in the public interest for them to be returned to their home country,”

“They’re being used for political purposes by the council.”

New Study Concludes No One Is Stupid Enough To Say They’d Vote For A Former PM

TEXT:

A recent study by the Australian Political Association has found that none of the country’s elected officials are as stupid as they first appear on the scene.

The findings of the report concluded that nobody is as stupid as they first appear in a campaign ad, and that nobody is as stupid as they last time they were in the job.

The study found that no elected officials were as stupid as they were, and that no elected officials are as stupid as they ever will be.

“It doesn’t matter whether they are the longest serving PM in Australia’s history or not, the fact that they have managed to get away with saying that they are a former member of the Australian Liberal Party is enough to make people forget that they are a former member of the Australian Liberal Party,” said the lead researcher of the report, Professor Aidan Davies.

“The fact that no one else in Australia has ever done it is also important to note. The fact that nobody else has ever made the same mistake as the Liberal Party, and have had to answer for their actions, is also important to note.”

The Advocate reached out to a number of politicians who have been in the job for a number of years now, most of whom were too busy to speak on the record.

A number of former politicians who were in the job for very short periods of time, and had little to no influence on the course of Australian politics, said that they are often the target of “insults” and “dodgy” comments made by “old people who don’t know what they are doing.”

One politician, who was in the job for just a few months, said that he was often made fun of because he’s not a “real politician”.

“I’m not a real politician,” said the politician.

“I’m a former member of the Australian Liberal Party,”

“That’s not to say I don’t care about the future of our nation or what the party stands for.”

“We Need To Focus On The Issues, And Be More Specific” Says Turnbull

TEXT:

The Prime Minister has today announced that he is throwing the book at the man responsible for his predecessor’s leadership loss, and the man that the nation’s voters chose as their leader last August.

This comes after the Australian public was left to choose between two very different leaders – and both of them have been given a lot of criticism for their leadership performance.

The Liberal Party is under fire for their lack of action on the issue of climate change and the fact that they both actively tried to dismantle the Clean Energy Finance Corporation.

This comes after Turnbull was given a chance to clean up his act. His party has been criticised for not doing more to stand up for the environment, and not being more specific on the issues that the nation’s voters gave him a chance to clean up in the lead up to the election.

“This is a classic case of the old old ‘I’m the only one who can save you’d be more specific, and I’m the only one who can win you””

“I mean, we’ve got the climate change thing to worry about, but we also have the NBN, and that’s a bit more interesting, and I don’t really care about the environment, so I’ll just focus on that.”

The Prime Minister says he’s willing to take a more active role in the leadership campaign, but won’t be too much different from previous Prime Ministers, who he says he has “always had a strong relationship with”.

Pete Evans Confirms He’s Not The One

A leading Australian sports figure has hit out at the constant portrayal of him as a one-man-band, after the man himself revealed that he’s actually a multiple multi-millionaire entrepreneur.

The 'Horseman’ says that he’s never had a job that he’s regretted – and that he’s always been the type of guy who’d be willing to do anything to get his own thrill.

“You’d think that I’d be a multi-millionaire by now,” he said. “But I’ve done a lot of bad luck. I’ve been a horseman, and I’ve been a businessman. I’ve been a lot of things.”

“But I’ve always been the type of guy who says I’ve got a long list of qualifications that I’d need if I ever wanted to be a multi-millionaire.”

Evans, who’s still in the public eye after a short spell as the CEO of a major South Australian mining company, says that he’s always had a pair of socks on when he’s had to hustle for a bit of a bit of a pay check.

“I just never thought I’d be able to get a job where I didn’t have to work like a horse,” he said.

“But I guess I’m lucky I’ve never had to work like a horse, because I’d be fucked. I’d be a broken man if I didn’t get a job. I’d be on the way to being a multi-millionaire by now if I didn’t start early.”

Unhealthy Religious Beliefs Driving Economy

TEXT:

A recent report by the CSIRO has found that the largest religious group in Australia, the Jehovah’s Witnesses, are also the most unhealthy – as a result of their high rates of belief, low levels of evidence and widespread disregard for the common sense.

Jehovah’s Witnesses are Australia’s largest religious community, with approximately 330,000 adherents in Australia, as well as adherents in several Pacific Nations, Europe and North America.

The Jehovah’s Witnesses have been linked to a number of unhealthy behaviours, including:

• Smoking,

• Drinking alcohol and

• Pre-marital sex

While there is some good that can be found within the organization, such as the emphasis on family values, the fact that the average adherents of this religion are unable to give birth to a healthy, emotionally fulfilling relationship, is also a testament to the unhealthy standards of the religion.

The CSIRO report has found that:

David Warner Is A Fucking Ghost

The team’s media advisor was also spotted, as was the team’s Director of Communications, who has also been spotted in the middle of the pitch with a bottle of the same.

David Warner, who was also the Chief Winemaker at the popular resort, the Royal Sydney Golf Club, was last seen holding a can of beer that he had earned on the occasion of a big win in the Caribbean.

A local woman has today gone one step further and asked who she’s talking to.

“Who’s talking to me?”

“Who’s sending me?”

The line was taken by a local woman named Ashley, who wants to know who she’s talking to.

“Who’s sending me?”

According to Ashley, she’s a local woman who’s lived in the same house for 10 years and never left.

“Who’s sending me?”

“Who’s sending me?”

While it’s quite a pressing issue, one that needs to be solved before we can move on to something else, Ashley says she’s got some ideas on how to go about it.

“I’m gonna get a friend over for a laugh. It’s gonna be a good opportunity to get some knowledge on how to get her number.”

“I’m not coming in the house.”

The Advocate reached out to Ashley for comment but she says she’s got a bit of a hold on her emotions and won’t be back to talk to us until later.

“You Can’t Say Anything Now, You’re Dead” Says Man Who Thought He Was Above The Law

TEXT:

A man who thinks he is above the law has today lashed out at a New South Boomer’s Council campaign to remove the word ‘angry’ from the council’s bylaw.

Peter Canavan, the former chief of staff to the local council, says he’s a big fan of the council’s campaign to be more inclusive and fair.

“This is the real Australia,” he said.

“The real Australia, where I can say ‘he’s a real cunt’ without fear of being called a ‘cunt’ in the future.”

The man who once had the gall to tell a female colleague that she was ‘a piece of shit’ for taking a week off to have a family, says he doesn’t know how to deal with people like the ones he’s currently dealing with.

“How am I supposed to tell these people that I don’t think you’re a piece of shit if you’re not prepared to move to the next town over to help out with the kids?” he asked.

“How are these people supposed to know I’m a real cunt if they’re not even going to call me a cunt in public?”

“I’m not sure how you manage to pull this off. You’re a piece of shit and you need to go.”

The council declined to make comment on whether or not they’d consider removing the word ‘cunt’ from their bylaw again.

Queensland Is The Best Place On Earth For Gay Rights Activists

TEXT:

After a hard fought battle, the Queensland is the best place on Earth for gay rights activists, according to a new report by the United Nations.

The report, which was released earlier this week, was commissioned by the Australian Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras, who believe that the best place on Earth for gay rights activists is in New York City.

“Queensland is the best place on Earth for gay rights activists” says one researcher.

“The most hardcore gay rights activists can come from anywhere. Melbourne, London, Canberra, even Sydney,”

“But most are drawn from New York. It’s the gay heartland.”

In a recent report, the UN has found that the gay rights movement is the only political movement on Earth that is able to thrive off the benevolence of the Australian public.

“It’s the heartland of the most politically active gay rights movement” said the UN’s special rapporteur on LGBTI rights, Christos Papadopoulos.

“It’s the heartland of the gay rights movement,”

“Which is why we recommend that you come here,”

“You will be treated like a king.”

ROCKING A ROCKET SCOON and HAMMER on the roof of his mouth is a rite of passage for many young Australians.

For many, it’s the first time they’ve been exposed to the full power of the nation’s most popular sporting team – something that gives them a sense of belonging and a sense of pride.

For Roxy Moulin, it’s a rite of passage that he will never forget.

The 25-year-old son of a prominent local solicitor has today hit back at the critics, saying that the dystopian story-telling from the new film is a pretty good film.

After watching the latest installment in the popular television series, The Handmaid’s Tale, Gavin Delaney (25) says the dystopian story-telling from the new film is a pretty good film.

Speaking candidly to The Advocate this morning, Delaney’s father, Bruce, said that while he agrees that the film is an accurate depiction of the dystopian future that viewers have all been living in for the last decade, he also feels that the dystopian story-telling from the new film is a pretty good film.

“You know, I’m pretty sure my daughter would have a pretty good idea about what the world is like if that part of the world was wiped out,” said Bruce.

“But yeah, I’m not going to spoil anything for you, I just want you to know that this film is pretty bloody good,”

“I mean, it’s based on a book, so there’s that. But the dystopian shit that we are going for is pretty refreshing, I’ve read the book, so it’s pretty much the same as what we’re going for.”

Sydney Real Estate Market Looks To Get A Boost From The Release Of Shazam 2.0

TEXT:

As the hype surrounding the release of Shazam 2.0 builds, many locals and tourists are starting to worry that the release will have a detrimental effect on the market. 

The popular digital rnb-sampling app has been in beta testing for some time now, and many are starting to worry that it may have caused a number of premature deaths, particularly in inner-city suburbs like Newtown and Darlinghurst. 

“There’s nothing better than hearing the clinking of the top button and feeling the tingle of the silver tongue,” explained one young professional property manager. 

“It’s so much better than hearing people singing and clapping when they’re really singing and clapping when they’re really singing. It’s so much better.” 

“But yeah, it’s not good. It’s not great, it’s not great at all. It’s not even great in terms of quality of life.” 

Our reporter reached out to a number of locals who have been using Shazam to check the quality of life effects the app has on their lives, and the majority of them said they were happy with how it was living their lives. 

One woman said she was happy with how her life is now. 

“It’s so much better because I don’t have to get up at 5 am to get to work,” she said. 

“I can go to sleep at night knowing I’ve got my morning coffee in my hand at 3 pm and I’m going to get my midday coffee at 5 because I’m a free man.” 

Another local property manager said he was also happy with how his life is now. 

“I’m just glad I didn’t get my morning coffee yesterday because I don’t get it and I can’t wait to get my midday coffee because I’m a free man,” he said. 

“The app will tell me when it’s time and I’ll just click on the app again, I don’t need to get my morning coffee and my midday coffee at the same time.” 

“I’m just so happy.”

After a career spruiking the virtues of a few hip hop artists, including Pharrell Williams, Kanye West, and Jay-Z, a prominent hip hop artist, Macklemore, has today revealed that his first real rap album came from a hip hop album.

Yeezy’s new album, titled ‘Humble Rap’, is set to be released on Spotify on April 15, just in time for the NBA playoffs.

The album features a soundtrack that includes guest appearances from Kendrick Lamar, Biggie Smalls, and MF DOOM.

The album features a soundtrack that includes guest appearances from Kendrick Lamar, Biggie Smalls, and MF DOOM. The album was produced by Rick Rubin and Jay-Z himself.

Kanye West, Pharrell Williams, and Jay-Z are just some of the artists on the album, but Macklemore is also a big fan of other rappers who’s lyrical content is similar to his own, but with a different hook.

“I just think rap is so dope” he said.

“I mean, I’m from the Bronx, so I know the real rap, man. But I’m a big fan of Nas, man. The Bronx is so rich in music history”

The album was initially met with backlash, mainly because it was leaked onto The Pirate Bay, where the artist himself was able to make the record. However, the US Federal Court threw the book at the Napster file-sharing network, ordering it to be seized by the authorities.

The Federal Government have since taken the rare step of releasing the entire album online for free.

“I don’t want them playing them, it’s just a game,” says Peter O’Meara, a 37-year-old Betoota dad.

O’Meara’s comments come as the controversial “toy-to-life” game, ‘Tower of Joy’, was banned from all Queensland schools this week, sparking widespread condemnation from parents and teachers.

It’s a controversial parenting choice, with some saying it’s a dangerous distraction from important lessons that teach kids about self-confidence and perseverance, while others saying it’s a harmless diversion to harmless games such as ‘Mortal Kombat’ and ‘Battletoads’.

However, one local dad says he doesn’t give a shit.

“I’m not a fucking videogame dad,” says local dad, Peter O’Meara.

“I don’t give a fuck. It’s a game, it’s just a game they’re playing in a room with no distractions. It’s a fucking game.”

Local Woman’s Day Drinking Funeral Gains Momentum As Nation’s Youth Voters Don’t Care About Us

A local woman’s funeral is an occasion in which a person leaves the services of a church or other organisation, in lieu of paying a private funeral, usually in a casket or other container, to attend a funeral service.

This is usually done to pay respect to a loved one who has passed away, or to a friend or relative who has died.

However, for Christy Grosvenor, her funeral this week has gained momentum as a Nation’s youth voters don’t care about her or her family.

“It’s sad, but true,” she said.

“My cousin, who’s been a friend for a long time, died a few years ago, but he was only 33. That’s a long time to live,”

“Dad, who I think is a bit of a nut, died a few years ago and he was a bit older, but he’s still pretty funny. He used to be a bit of a bogan, but he went and got a job at McDonald’s, so he’s not exactly a national treasure anymore,”

“But yeah. This country is dying. I don’t think it’s a good idea to be a Country Man on a Country Day, that’s the day our country was founded and preserved as a Christian nation.”

However, Christy’s cousin’s older brother told The Advocate that he thinks this country needs to take a hard look at itself.

Braden Grosvenor, who’s just turned 38, said that he thinks there’s something a bit off about celebrating Australia Day in August.

“It’s a pretty obvious case of being left-wing on the day and then being left-wing on the night,” he said.

“It’s a pretty obvious trend that doesn’t really make sense. Why celebrate August on Australia Day when you can go out and have a few cold ones with some mates and celebrate the great Australian pastime of, you know, shagging,”

Abbott Says Australia Will Not Be Taken By Islam If He Doesn’t Take It’s Own Way

Former Prime Minister Tony Abbott has today warned that the nation of Australia will not be taken by Islam if he doesn’t take its way, and that the only way to take it is to take it from within.

The former Prime Minister has today warned that the nation of Australia will not be taken by Islam if he doesn’t take it’s way, and that the only way to take it is to take it from within.

Abbott has today told the nation that the only way to take it is to ‘take it from within’ – a powerful message for a nation still reeling from the traumatic experiences of the last decade, and the subsequent rise of Islam.

“The only way to take it is to take it from within,” he said.

“It is within the Australian way.”

Abbott, who was once a staunch supporter of the idea of a Jewish state, has today explained that there is a much better way.

“We will not be taken by Islam if I don’t take it” he said.

“This is a war on terror. Islam is not a religion, it is a political ideology. Australia is not a state religion. Islam is not a political ideology, it is a religion.”

“The only way to take it is to take it from within. This is a war on terror. Islam is not a religion, it is a political ideology. Australia is not a state religion. Islam is not a political ideology, it is a religion.”

“The only way to take it is to take it from within. This is a war on terror. Islam is not a religion, it is a political ideology. Australia is not a state religion. Islam is not a political ideology, it is a religion.”

Abbott’s comments come as the nation is grappling with the difficult task of both acknowledging and dealing with the rise of Islam, a movement which has gained significant traction in recent years.

While the Australian media has largely stayed silent on the issue – with many politicians and commentators – the rise of the movement has also made the Australian public realise that we are not taking Islam very seriously.

It has been confirmed that the rise of Islam has a lot to do with the fact that we are not giving enough attention to the fact that we are a nation which is based upon religious minorities.

Abbott, who has in the past referred to Islam as a “cancer on the Australian psyche”, has today explained that this is not a war on terrorism.

“This is a war on Islam. Islam is not a religion, it is a political ideology. Australia is not a state religion. Islam is not a political ideology, it is a religion.”

Liberal Party To Replace NSW Police With Border Force

TEXT:

The New South Wales Police have today announced that they will be replacing their existing border force operations with a new model of policing – with Liberal Party insiders saying that the new model of policing is going to work much better with the local community.

The announcement follows revelations that NSW Police have been using a quota system for low-level, non-violent offenders – which has resulted in significant concerns for community members.

New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian said that the state police would be focusing on areas that are not easily policed by current police – and that the government was confident that the current model would work well.

“We are confident that the current model will work well with the communities in terms of the type of offenders and the level of criminality that they pose” she said.

“It will be a far more hands-on approach, and not one that will leave you feeling like you’re powerless to the authorities”

“It will be a model that our community can be proud of”

The Premier has also said that the new model of policing would be based on a “smooth continuum” – between the most violent offenders and the least violent.

“We want to make sure that we don’t have people who are breaking the law at the top end, but also don’t have people who are breaking the law at the bottom end,” she said.

“We want to make sure that we have a level of community policing that is also relevant to the communities at the bottom end,” she said.

The Premier has also promised that the existing police officers who are already in the top job would be replaced with “a more targeted recruitment system” – in an attempt to avoid the feeling of paranoia that has plagued communities like Newtown and Ballarat over the last few months.

“Then I’ll have to pay off the house deposit and then the deposit on the house. Then the deposit on the house and the deposit on the car,”

“It’s a bit of a rough patch.”

However, the 28-year-old, full-time-live-at-home-mum isn’t taking any chances.

“I’m going to have to work hard at it,” she said.

“I’m not going to be able to save for the future and I’m not going to have a decent life. I’m just trying to make it work,”

“The only way I’m going to be able to save is if I work hard and get my debts paid off. That’s what I’m going to do.”

Bloke in a Trump shirt says “I’m not racist,” but still has a lot of racist thoughts

TEXT:

A WHITE man who has a lot of racist thoughts says he’s a ‘not a racist’ because he’s a white man who likes Donald Trump.

“He’s a great businessman. He knows a thing or two about winning people over,” says Glenn Hose (55) a local IT worker who doesn’t really like many people in his community but feels obligated to vote for the Republican candidate because he’s one of them.

“I mean, sure, I don’t like all the n-words he’s written… but that’s beside the point,” says Glenn.

“He’s a real estate mogul. I’m just saying. I’m not racist,”

Glenn says he’s often tempted to support the President by reading articles written by people who aren’t his ideological opposites but never does.

“I’ve just never found the time. You know what, I’m going to go and read that stuff anyway.”

Glenn says he’s not racist because he’s not one of them.

“Look, I’m not a racist. I’m just a white male who’s been raised in a strict white family… And I’m not one of them.”

Morrison Denies Direct Link Between Abusive Fathers And Lack Of Child Support

TEXT:

Prime Minister Scott Morrison has today refused to back down on his claim that the current system of child support payments is unfair.

It is a claim that has outraged the Australian Catholic Family Association (ACCA), which has labelled the Government’s policies as “unAustralian”.

The Catholic Family Association (CFC) have today released a statement calling for the Government to look into the policies of the current child support system.

The CFC says the current system of payments is not based on the needs and needs of the child, but rather on the need of the parent.

The CFC say the current system is unfair because it is based on the needs of the parent, rather than the needs of the child.

“We are a non-denominational, voluntary association of Christians and we do not need to pay for our child support,” said one spokesman for the CFC.

“We have a policy of not paying for children’s support and we are proud to be an association of Christians,” the spokesman said.

“So we are calling on the Government to look into our current payments and change the current system so that we do not pay for the support of non-Christians.”

“It’s just that, there has been nothing to suggest that the current system is unfair,” the spokesman said.

The CFC also made it clear that they are not in the business of punishing people for being Christians, so long as they don’t try to use the CFC as a vehicle to get a higher rate.

Local Woman Defends Hobby Farm Use As A Means Of Reminding Other People Of Her Favourite Food

TEXT:

Beryl Melrose (32) says her love of hunting and fishing has always been an important part of her life, but the recent rise in interest in ‘farm-to-table’ food has really taken her mind off how underwhelming the whole thing has been.

“I mean, I’m not going to get a real job in the real world, I’m going to work in a cubicle in a bank office,” she said.

“But I do love hunting and fishing. I’ve always wanted to get out into the bush and have a go at something. Like try to catch something that’s bigger than a small dog, or a big cat. Something big enough to eat you, or something big enough to kill you. Something big and scary,”

“Like, I’ve tried to make a point of telling people I’m a big hunter. Like, I’ve tried telling people I’m a big angler. I’m a big hunter, and I’m a big angler.”

Beryl’s husband Greg (35) says he’s not too concerned by his wife’s obsession, but she has to admit she’s definitely got a point.

“It’s hard to watch a couple of young people with a passion for hunting and fishing and a lack of any real life experience trying to catch something bigger than a small dog,” he said.

“I’m a big hunter, and I’m a big angler. We’re not out to get you, we’re just trying to get you out there,”

Chris Pyne asks his staff to keep an eye on the state of the nation’s Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities

TEXT:

As the nation’s Indigenous leaders convene in Canberra this week for a second summit of the Indigenous peoples, former Prime Minister Chris Pyne has asked his staff to ‘watch the state of the nation’s Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities’.

Speaking to The Advocate this morning via telephone, the Aboriginal affairs expert said he was not at liberty to speak on the matter, but asked his staff to ‘watch the state of the nation’s Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities’ to see if they needed any help.

“It’s a delicate balance between wanting to be helpful and not wanting to be helpful,” he said.

“But, you know, if we’re not helping these people, then what? If we’re not helping them, then who are we to have a go? I mean, I don’t think there’s much we can do. We’ve been told they don’t have much. So I asked my staff to watch them and see if they need anything. If they need anything, they should ring me. But I’ll ring the first bloke.”

The Advocate reached out to the Minister for Indigenous Affairs for comment but he was too busy putting on a public appearance to call for a Royal Commission into why the AIS doesn’t even think that there is a problem with Indigenous Australians.

Mum’s New Girlfriend Not Realising How Bad It Is Yet

Mum has finally realised how bad things are for her and her family, and is trying to come up with a plan to fix them.

In a recent Facebook status, the 63-year-old mother of two said that she feels as though she’s getting older and she’s beginning to wonder if she’s getting old, or if it’s just that her kids are getting older and more difficult to raise.

“I’m starting to get real about this whole process of getting older and getting tougher,” she wrote.

“I’m thinking about changing my family’s diet and maybe getting a new car. Maybe even a new house. Honestly, though. I’m not sure. I’m not sure what’s wrong with them. I don’t know how I’m going to pay for all this stuff I’ve been shoveling into my mortgage payments,”

“It’s getting real, it really is. I’m not getting any younger, though.”

Mum’s new girlfriend, Amanda, said that she’s been trying to come up with a plan to help pay for all of the things she’s been shoveling into her mortgage for the past decade, but she’s been consistently out-peddled by her husband.

“I’ve been trying to get him to buy a bigger boat, like a bigger yacht or something, but he just doesn’t want to be a young man anymore,” she said.

“But I’m getting old, and he’s still a young man. I’m pretty sure he’s never going to have kids, but he’s a good young man,”

“But I don’t know. I’m not sure he’s ever going to have a real job. He’s only going to be a small business owner. Maybe he’s got a role in a bank or something. I’m not sure. He’s a young man. I’m not sure.”

Local Woman’s Love Of The Tomboy Percolates Into Unbridled Hogget

For the past few years, Sophie Rogers, has been enjoying the time off from work. She’s spent time with her family on the banks of the lovely Spring River, time spent visiting the homes of her neighbours.

“I’ve just been so enthralled with it, it’s amazing,” she said.

“It was such a different time back then, I had so many things to do. Mum had to get up early for the big day, Dad had to go down to the shops for the meat pies, Mum had to get her car to get her groceries from the butcher, and I had to get my school books from the library.”

“It was such a rush,” she said.

“I’ve never felt so alive.”

As a young woman, Sophie was very quick to judge the culture of the country. She says it’s this instant kind of intellectualism that has brought her to this point.

Labor Hoping Australian Labor Party Members Are Not Allowed To Have An Apology

“We’ve Been Working On A Few New Songs” Says Sydney’s Own Lullaby

TEXT:

Sydney’s own lullaby, which every now and then gets a bit of a run in the national press, has today revealed that it’s been working on a few new songs.

This comes as the city’s board of councillors decide that they’re going to move away from the traditional naming of streets, and instead opt for more traditional street names.

The current streets  are:

• Hornby Street – The Kings Cross district

• Parramatta Road – The Western suburbs

• Rue de Branlette – The city of Sydney’s eastern suburbs

• Rue du Lapin – The southern suburbs

• Rue du Lapin Boulevard – The western suburbs

• Rue du Lapin Drive – The city of Sydney’s eastern suburbs

The new streets will be named after prominent local people, such as:

• Sydney’s Mayor, Clover Moore

• Sydney’s foreign property developers, including the development of the city’s eastern suburbs

• Sydney’s overseas property investors, including the construction of the city’s eastern suburbs

“We’ve been working on a few songs this afternoon,” says Mayor Moore.

“It’s great to be able to refer to our new streets by their actual street names, instead of the old street names that we used to use in the past.”

“It’s also great to be able to keep the old street names, because they’re not going to get a huge rebrand, either.”

The new names have been revealed today, ahead of the official rebrand, which is expected to take place in the next couple months.

It is believed that Moore will refer to the new streets as “Lyon Street” and “Leyonhjelm Street” – the latter of which has been revealed to be the actual street name of the street.

“We’ve got some exciting new music coming up,” says Moore.

“I’m just a little bit excited to show off the new names to you all,”

“It’s a little bit of fun, but it’s not something I’m particularly proud of, but I’m sure it’ll be cool,”

“We’ve got a few big hits coming up, so be sure to tune in,”

Senator Di Natale Calls For The Royal Commission Into Why Sydney’s High-Rises Aren’t Actually That High

TEXT:

[dropcap]S[/dropcap]heep[/dropcap]n’ the year’s most recent report by the CSIRO has found that the most recent high-rises in Sydney’s skyline are actually the most recent high rises.

While the city’s skyline has been changing dramatically over the last few decades, it’s actually the same architecture, or rather, very similar architecture, that’s been there for a while.

This means that the very reason that Sydney’s skyline has been getting so high is because it’s very nearly identical to the same reason the city’s population has been getting so low.

This is because the same people who built these buildings are the same people who are responsible for the city’s unsustainable rise in noise and air pollution.

This also means that the very reason that Sydney’s skyline is the same as it was when the city was having a massive construction boom is because the same people who built these buildings are the same people who are responsible for the city’s unsustainable rise in noise and air pollution.

ABC Announces Plans To Build A ‘Real World’ Like Melbourne For The 3rd Year In A Row

TEXT:

THE ABC is today looking to replace the city of Melbourne with a ‘real world’ that doesn’t exist.

That’s the message from the board and CEO David Koch this morning after the corporation revealed plans to build a ‘real world’ in Melbourne for the 3rd time in a row.

This follows the news that the nation’s peak scientific body, the CSIRO, has concluded that climate change is real, and that man-made greenhouse gases are not.

The CSIRO’s announcement comes as the ABC faces mounting pressure to make a more direct link between the ABC and the CSIRO’s findings that the corporation is ‘unfit’ to continue broadcasting in the face of overwhelming scientific evidence that the earth is not warming.

“That’s why we’re building a real world like Melbourne for the 3rd year in a row,” said Koch.

“Because it’s the only way to keep our audience engaged,” he said.

“And by engaging, we mean listening to our climate change commentary and reporting on the real issues facing young people right now, like renewable energy and the future of this planet.”

Koch then explained that the ABC needs to be more like the dominant broadcast network in Australia, and that’s something he’s already started.

“We’ve got a great team here at the ABC. They’ve already got a great team, and they need to be even better,” he said.

“So we’ve got a few ideas on how to get there, but the real world isn’t on the ABC, it’s on the dominant broadcast network in Australia,”

“And that’s the ABC for you,”

“We’d love to hear your thoughts on this,”

“Our news and current affairs programs are your only bet. We’ll be here in the coming months, and we’ll keep you posted.”

Man Who Bought A House With A View In It Now Only Has The Right To Have One

TEXT:

A local man has had to learn that you can have a view in it, as well as a home, if you want.

The same goes for a view in a house, as well as a view in a bed and a view in a car.

“It’s just a bit of fun, but you know what I mean,” said the man.

“I guess you’ve got a view in a house, but you can have a view in a house, as well as a view in a car,”

“But, you know, I’ve been looking at houses in the bush. I’ve been looking at houses in the bush with a view. I’m not saying I’m not looking at houses in the bush, but I’m saying it’s the same thing.”

The man then explained that he’s never had a view in a house with a view in it, but if he does, he’ll have to learn how to take a view in a house with a view in it.

“Yeah, but, but. A house with a view in it, but with a view in it, you know?” he said.

“It’s like, I guess you can’t have a view in a house with a view in it. That’s what I’m getting at.”

“I mean, look, I don’t know. I’ve been looking at houses in the bush for years. I’ve been looking at houses in the bush for the past six years. I’ve been looking at houses in the bush with a view,”

“But, you know what I mean. It’s like, I don’t know. It’s like, I’m never going to have a view in a house with a view in it. I’m going to have to learn how to take a view in a house with a view in it.”

The man then explained that he’s had to learn that a view in a house is more important than a view in a house with a view in it, and that’s a view he’ll never have a view in a house with a view in it.

Small Town Journo Takes The Time To Talk To Local Ringer About His Experience

TEXT:

A small town boy has today taken the time to tell a local shepherd about the life experience that he’s just described.

The 13-year-old journo Joseph (7) says he’s been in a pretty good place for a while now, but he’s just got a bit of a rust around the place.

While visiting his old man in the Old City District this afternoon, Joseph was hoping to get a bit of context for his account of the weekend’s events, and even asked the old man a bit about himself.

“Mate, what happened down here last weekend?” he asked the old man, who was well aware of Joseph’s reputation as a bit of a loose cannon.

“Mate, you’ve been to these places before?”

“Yeah, these.”

The old man looked at Joseph’s account and thought long and carefully about what he was going to say.

“Well, I went to the same place last weekend, but I didn’t really go much.”

“I went there to have a look.”

“They were having a rave, mate. A real one, not a bunch of people hanging out in the parks or anything like that.”

“It was pretty wild, mate. The vibe was pretty wild,” said the old man.

“There was like 30 of us there, just chillin in the cool room with the sound system playing and stuff.”

“And then we went out and found some food.”

Malcolm Roberts Confirms Malcolm Turnbull Should Be PM By 2020

TEXT:

Tension has arisen between two prominent former colleagues in the upper house today, with one senator leading the charge to oust the Prime Minister.

The two men are currently embroiled in a bitter war of words over the Senator’s decision to publicly label a fellow Australian a ‘dum bushie’ – a derogatory term used by the far-right to describe people who are not white.

The feud has resulted in a spat in which Roberts has led the Coalition to lose more and more of their seats in the South Australian by-election, while Turnbull has lost more and more of his office to more and more of the ALP.

As the two men continue to battle it out for the remaining seats, the Prime Minister has been forced to step in and try and smooth things over the process.

Speaking today at a press conference from the country’s most important political moment, Mr Turnbull explained that he’s been trying to get Malcolm to lead the Coalition towards an election win for months now, but have been outsmarted by the career politician.

“I mean, I’ve got Malcolm in the back seat,” said Turnbull.

“But I’ve also got Barnaby and the three others up top, and I’ve got a couple of my own backbenchers, but I’ve been outflanked by the career politician,”

“I’m hoping that if Barnaby can get over the line and start acting like an adult, we can get one of the junior backbenchers, or something like that. But as I said, I’m not holding my breath.”

Turnbull’s comments come as the Senator says the Coalition has lost the election for the reasons he outlined.

“The ALP have been taking more and more seats, and the Coalition has been winning the race for the hills,”

“The Coalition has always been a bit slow on the uptake,”

“But this election is different,”

“Turnbull has been putting more and more of the Coalition’s backbenchers up on the front benches,”

“They’ve started to look a bit old and stale,”

“Malcolm has been stepping up his game as well. He’s getting older and getting older, but I’m not sure if it’s killing the party, or he’s just getting old. I mean, he’s been in a pretty good place to be honest. I don’t know if he’s even got the energy to laugh at people when they’re having a laugh at him,”

“This is just a bit of bad news for Malcolm.”

New Study Confirms Man’s Morbid Obesity Is A Very Bad Thing

TEXT:

Australia’s peak scientific body, the CSIRO, has today released a new study which has today found that morbidly obese people are a very bad thing.

The CSIRO have concluded that the shape of a person is not the most important thing in their decision to become morbidly obese.

In fact, the CSIRO have found that morbidly obese people are not even the best thing for their health.

“If anything, they’re a very, very bad thing” said one researcher.

“The shape of a person is not the most important thing in their decision to become morbidly obese,” said the researcher.

“In fact, the CSIRO have found that morbidly obese people are not even the best thing for their health.”

The CSIRO’s lead researcher explained that the government’s decision to include the shape of people into the Australian population, particularly morbidly obese people, was a mistake.

“We don’t think people should be judged on how fat they are,” said the researcher.

“We think people should be judged on how fit they are,”

“That’s what we call fitness.”

The CSIRO’s lead researcher then went on to explain that the shape of people is only one factor in their health, and that the shape of a person is not the best way to judge their fitness.

“This is why we’ve spent the last couple of decades trying to find ways to measure fitness.”

“What we found is that the shape of a person is not the best way to tell whether a person is fit or not,” said the CSIRO researcher.

“So instead of telling people to lose weight, we’ve been telling people to get fit.”

“It’s a win-win situation.”

“It’s a Catch-22, Jeez!” Says Small Business Owner On The Phone To Family And Friends

TEXT:

A small business owner in the Diamantina Shire has hit back at claims that his business is ‘just a bit more of a novelty than a business’ – after he got caught red-handed selling cigarettes to the public.

“There’s no way I’m going to get a licence and then be a regular in the community,” explained the owner of Poyson’s Cigarettes in the Old City District.

“If they catch me smoking outside, I’ll have to pay a fine and get a smoking ban. If they catch me smoking inside, I’ll have to pay a fine and have my smoking ban lifted. If they give me a good time, I’ll be a regular.”

The small-business-owner-turned-politician-turned-cigarette-owner is a proud member of the Australian Smokers’ Guild, a not-for-profit organisation that supports and encourages the use of electronic cigarettes for smoking cessation.

“My goal isn’t just to make money. My goal is to make sure people know that you can get a better deal with your tobacco then what they’re selling you,” he said.

“That’s my goal.”

“And by making sure people know that, I’m not just making my customers suffer, I’m making them pay for it.”

The move comes after the Prime Minister announced a national policy this week to help the nation’s ‘right-faction’ by giving them a better chance at winning over the next few years.

“I think it’s fair to say that the current situation has seen the nation struggling to gain access to a fair go,” Morrison said.

“So in a few days time, I’ll be rolling out a national policy to help the nation,” he said, before leaving a short time ago to spend time with his rural constituents.

The plan has been met with outrage from both the Coalition and Opposition, with some Coalition figures coming out swinging against the plan.

However, Morrison says the plan is ‘100%’ going ahead.

“Huge. Huge.” he said.

“It’s like we’ve just taken the piss,” he laughed.

Brisbane Beer Company Introduces New ‘Thai’ Flavoured Rum & Coke To Go With Their Extra-Hot New Season

TEXT:

BRISBANE, QLD (QLD) - 

The River City’s biggest beer distributor, Brisbane Beer, announced today that they’ve come up with a clever new way to market themselves.

Thai flavours of Rum and Coke are now on the shelves in their Australian stores and online,

The companies announced this morning that they’ve made a bold decision to make the rum and cola a little bit hotter than usual.

“We’ve decided to go with the hottest new flavours,” a spokesperson for Brisbane Beer told The Advocate this morning.

“You know what, we don’t even care that the boys are getting a bit old. This is just about the hottest new stuff in town,”

“We’ve got a few new seasons in the can and a couple of new beers on the way. So if you’re reading this, my secret is out. You’ll be getting some hot one day.”

The Advocate reached out to a number of local beer enthusiasts for comment and received a number of responses.

One of those who responded said that he’s been a fan of Brisbane Beer for a number of years now and that he’s never really felt the need to drink a little bit of rum and cola.

Dennis Grange, of the RSL Brew Club, said he’s often near the Brisbane Stockland and he’s often the first to ask for the Thai iced tea.

“It’s just not on,” he said.

“It’s not that I don’t like the taste or anything, it’s just that I don’t want to drink it. I’m not a Thai drinker, I drink domestic tea, not the fancy Thai kind,”

“I think I might just drink it with some coconut milk and that’s it.”

New Study Confirms That The ABC Is More Than Just A For-Profit Media Company

A study conducted by the Fair Work Commission, which regulates the working conditions of public servants, found that the ABC is a for-profit media company that has a purpose and commercial viability, and should therefore be paid fairly and remunerated accordingly.

The ABC has always been a for-profit media company, as the only thing they do is report news and current affairs.

However, the study has found that the ABC has become a more independent media entity.

The study found that the ABC has become a for-profit media company because the ABC is run by and for wealthy owners and executives who want to make money as much as possible.

This comes after her husband of 40 years, Peter, died unexpectedly last week, leaving a gap in the family and a void in her heart.

In a world where the only thing that matters in the world is the rise and fall of a leader, Karen Pearson has decided to let her husband and the world know that she will be giving up her future as well.

The leader of the opposition told the media this afternoon that he has never been able to ride a motorbike.

“I’ve been to the shops and I’ve had to say, you know, I’m a little bit tired, you know, of all the motorbike stories,” he said.

“So, you know, I’ve got a Mercedes Benz wagon and a Yamaha bakkie [sic] and a Yamaha suit and a Yamaha bakkie,”

“I don’t think I’ve ever ridden a motorbike, but I do know that it’s quite difficult. I’ve been to Paris and I’ve seen the city, you know, and I’ve ridden motor bikes, so I’ve got a decent understanding of how motor bikes work.”

Mr Turnbull’s comments came as the Prime Minister was questioned about his motorbike rumours.

“I know, I’ve ridden them all over the country,” he said.

“The only place I’ve been to is New York City on my way to the Big Apple,”

“And I’ve been to the Gold Coast and I’ve ridden motor bikes, so I’ve got a good idea of how motor bikes work.”

Local Man Inseminated By Family Member After Getting His Shit Together

A prominent Betoota Grove local, who claims to have finally come to terms with his sexual orientation, has been inseminated by his family member, who he says is ‘the reason why he’s so pissed off’.

James Colwell, a 29-year-old divorced father of two, has reportedly spent the last few months inseminating his openly gay son, who was raised by his single mother.

“I just don’t understand it, mate” he said.

“Why are gays so bad?”

“They are so f**king f**king stupid. How can you even have a f**king debate?”

Colwell’s son, James, says he’s always been close with his mother’s f**king father but never with his own, and that he’s finally ‘got it right’ after being brainwashed by his mother.

“Mate, I was thinking about it. I was thinking about it. I was thinking about it. I was thinking about it, mate,” said Colwell.

“Then my f**king mother said, ‘You know what I’ve been waiting for, mate? You want to see me again on the c**ts?’ and I was like, ‘Wait, what’s c**ts?’ and my f**king mother said, ‘Well, c**ts are where we go for s**t.’ I was so f**king dumbfounded.”

That was also the year that Australia’s wealthiest man, Rupert Murdoch, was born.

The reason why they’re able to do this is because their town is so rough, with a reputation that any member of the nation’s poorest people can easily be connected to.

Speaking to The Advocate this morning through the straw he was wearing at the time, local townie and local piglet, Jock, said he was looking forward to visiting his cousins in Townsville, and he’s looking forward to it.

“Yeah, I guess I’ll be doing that next year,” he said.

“When the new school year starts, I’ll be going up to Townsville for the next few years, and then I’ll be moving up to Sydney or Melbourne or Brisbane,”

“But yeah, I’m still doing that job down there. I’ve got a few cousins up there. I’m not going to take a job up there, but I’ll definitely be taking the money from their bank accounts.”

The Advocate reached out to the Townsville Police for comment, but have yet to receive a reply.

Tragedy As Local Baby Boomer With No Education Gets His Mother On Track

TEXT:

A Betoota Grove mother of four was forced to have an emergency c-section this morning after she became unable to breastfeed her children without painkillers.

The 79-year-old woman, who has a bad case of rheumatic fever, had to have an operation on her back after her husband had to have another operation on his back after his back was fucked up.

The Advocate caught up with Bernice Meadow to see how she was feeling about the whole thing.

“My husband had to have another operation, too,” she said.

“They’re both fucked. My back hurts. My son is learning how to read and writing at a local high school. He’s just turned two years old,”

“I’ve been working hard all my life to give my children the best start in life. They’ve been having a hard time getting their head around this new world, but I know they’ll get it. I’m glad this operation was painless.”

However, the Advocate understands that it’s common for local mothers to have babies who have trouble nursing, despite the fact that they’re more likely to die from a lack of oxygen to the brain than from anything else.

Local Woman Not Sure Why All The Rage She Grew Up With On The Internet Is Just Rage GIFs

Local woman, Hayley Stacks (26) says she is pretty sure she has spent her entire life online.

“I mean, I’ve got a lot of friends on Facebook and Instagram, which is pretty cool,”

“But, I don’t know, I guess I’ve just never had the chance to actually hang out with real people. I guess I’ve just never had the chance.”

Hayley says she’s never really seen much of a world outside her small town community, but says there must be a lot of people like her who are just like her, but in a different location.

“I mean, I guess I’ve seen some really dumb things on the internet,”

“I mean, there’s this guy who said he was going to support the boycott of the Telstra Premiership unless the NRL were to move the Canberra Raiders to an ‘illusive’ NRL club,”

“And then there was this guy who said he was going to help the NAACP fight against the KKK because they’re racists,”

“It’s hard to tell, I guess I’m just a bit of a city girl.”

Hayley says she’s just not sure why all of the rage she grew up with on the internet is just rage GIFs.

Man Who Used To ‘Run Without A License’ At Pubs Now In A License, But Doesn’t Know What It Means

A local man, who once ran without a license at a pub because he was so scared to do so, is now in a license, but still doesn’t know what it means.

John Park, a 49-year-old divorced father of two from Betoota Grove, says he used to run without a license at pubs because he was scared to do so.

But that was before he met his wife, Wendy, and their two daughters, Lucy and Emily, and their new found love for running.

“Back in the day, I used to run without a license because I was scared to do so,” says the man, who was fearful to do so might have to pay a small fine at the local pub, but now that he’s a licensed, he just doesn’t know what it means.

“Back in the day, I used to run without a license because I was scared to do so,” he says.

“It’s a personal issue, not a public safety issue,” said Detective Marcus Cox, of Betoota Grove Police.

“There’s no need to be so negative about this. It’s not a public safety issue, it’s a personal one,”

“But yeah, we’ve got some tips for this man who has a license, but he’s still not a licensed,”

“What’s the deal with him?”

The Advocate reached out to the other licensed Betoota men and women who also had licenses but all of them had the same response.

“You’d be better off staying in the house, you fucking poon,” said one local woman.

New Study Finds Australian Students Are Just As Likely To Be Pregnant As The Next 20% Of All Australian Women

TEXT:

A new study released by the CSIRO has today revealed that Australian women are just as likely to be pregnant as the next 20% of all Australian women.

The study found that nearly all Australian women between the ages of 20-39 are at risk of becoming pregnant, due to a combination of genetics, poor diet and stress.

The CSIRO scientists say that this is due to the fact that Australian women are just as likely as Australian men to have low levels of healthy relationships and an array of negative health behaviours.

“It’s pretty clear that Australian women are just as likely to be pregnant as the next 20% of all Australian women” said lead researcher, Professor Dolly Bevan.

“If anything, this is reason to be concerned that Australia is a very, very unhealthy place.”

“The CSIRO has found that Australian women are just as likely as Australian men to be pregnant. And it’s not just the CSIRO, there’s also the IUCN, the Australian Institute of Sport and the CSIRO.

Bloke Who Says He’s Been To Paris Says He’s Always Had A Thought For The Future

TEXT:

After being born and raised in the same suburb as the iconic Louvre Museum, but never really visiting the Louvre himself, a local man says it’s hard to believe he’s such a pushover.

Darren, a 37-year-old who still lives at home with his parents, says he always knew there was a better place for him to live.

He says he’s had a few big nights at the Surf Club, some good times.

“Yeah, I’ve been to Paris a few times. I’ve seen some of the stuff the locals have on. The crazy shit, the sex and the violence,” he said.

“It’s just not for me, it’s not for me. So I went over there a few months ago. It’s a really great place. It’s just not for me.”

However, the fact that he’s been to Paris a few times also means that he’s obviously a Parisian first-year-of-the-year, which is a bit weird because he’s never actually left the country.

So he’s just basking in the cool fresh air while he thinks about the future, a place he’s never really been to.

“I’ve got a few things I’d like to do,” he said.

“I’ve got the chance to visit some of the places that I’ve always wanted to see but haven’t been able to since I was a kid. Paris is just one of them.”

“I don’t know how you live with these people. I’m pretty sure they’ve been in a car accident at some point,” he said.

“I’m voting for Donald because it’s all they’re doing. It’s the only way they can get elected because they’re fucked in the head,”

“I don’t like them being so self-absorbed. I like them being smart and not being as dumb as the other two, but I don’t want to be the smart one.”

Brad, who has a $2.8 million dollar asset value, says he’s going to vote for Donald because he thinks he’s the only one who understands the problem of our time.

“They’re all crooks. They’re all liars. They’re all losers.”

“I’m just saying, there’s so much I’m scared to death of the country going off the wrong track. This country is the greatest it’s ever been.”

Brad, who’s never married and hasn’t had any sexual contact, says he’s unsure if he’s been sleeping with women who aren’t his wife, but he’s not going to change his mind.

NRL Player Becomes Father Of A Unnamed Child After Losing Interest In Playing Rugby League

TEXT:

A young father of two named Darius Cochrane (26) has today revealed that he has become a father of an unnamed child after losing interest in rugby league.

“It’s just such a shame to lose interest in this game,” said the young man who is now a full-time NRL player.

“I mean, I love Rugby League and I love the game. But, losing interest in playing the sport, especially the game I love is pretty crook, especially when you consider how much I love the game.”

Cochrane was a passionate supporter of the NSWRL when they had a competition similar to the NRL competition but without the stars and glamour.

He spoke to The Advocate this morning in the smoking pokies of the Betoota Dolphins Leagues Club where he was enjoying a rare kick-on session with his partner-of-a-month, Amy.

“Amy and I are having a bit of a break at the moment,” he said.

“I’ve actually got a few hundred bucks and a bag of chips in the fridge so I’m just going to have a few bowls of noodles with a few bowls of tom yum soup and a can of beer,”

“I’m going to have a few bowls of the tom yum soup because I don’t want to be too full-on with the rugby union. I’m not even that interested in watching it. I’m just into watching the game.”

New Study Finds No One Really Likes Hip Hop

A new report by the CSIRO has today found that the very idea of ‘hip hop’ is at odds with the Australian way of life, and is actually a form of appropriation of Australian culture.

The report, released today, concluded that no one really likes hip hop – and that only the most privileged people in the country really do.

“It’s really hard to tell” said one researcher.

“We were looking at a lot of different types of music, and really couldn’t get enough of it”

“We found that very few Australians actually listen to hip hop”

This comes after the CSIRO released a study this week that found the overwhelming majority of Australians enjoy ‘hip hop’.

“It seems pretty clear that everyone here really likes it” said one CSIRO researcher.

“It’s just that, most of us don’t really understand why”

“We’ve found that most people really just enjoy the music because they like it”

“He was always the type of kid who’d walk out of a room and start throwing shit at the wall,”

Young Liberal Asks Why You Can’t Just Say ‘Queer’ Or ‘Transgender’

TEXT:

The son of two lesbian, gay, bisexual and questioning (LGBTI) people, Benji has today asked why people are confused about what he calls ‘queer’ and ‘transgender’.

“Why are people so confused?” he asks.

“Why can’t you just call me gay or call me transgender?”

Benji, a 19-year-old local, says that it’s because he is a gay man who identifies as a man.

“It’s just so weird” he says.

“I used to be a lesbian, now I don’t even know what I used to be called. I don’t even know how to use the bathroom at school.”

Benji says that being a gay man is so much easier than being a transgender man because you can just say ‘queer’ or ‘transgender’ without any guilt or shame.

“It’s so fucking gay” he says.

“I don’t get why people are so confused about it”

Benji says that he has had to learn how to use public toilets without any guilt because of his very public declaration that he is a lesbian, but also because he has had to learn how to refer to himself as a ‘gay man’ – a label that is not only extremely transphobic, but also incredibly offensive to women.

The Advocate caught up with Maggie Pissely, a local dairy farmer, to talk about her husband, Mike, and the latest bit of news that has come out of the town.

“You know, I’ve been to a fair bit of local history. It’s been real, it really is,” she said.

“I mean, the fair dinkum bushies that we have in town, I’ve seen them all over the place,”

“I’ve even seen the real Dorp on the water,”

“Back in the day, when I was growing up, I’d go and visit the old man on his farm. He’d be rocking a North Face with a little tweed jacket and a pair of chinos. He’d be rocking the old Fergie with the same old, same old, same old,”

“So yeah, I’ve been to a fair bit of the town’s history. Fair dinkum.”

While Mike Pissely has never been to any of the town’s authentic sites, like the actual town, or even the town square – he has been to a fair bit of the town’s museums, concerts, events and more.

Speaking candidly to The Advocate this morning, Mike said that he’s not a huge history buff, and that most people he knows are from the country.

“Why Should We Remain Neutral?” Asks Nation’s Oldest Male

TEXT:

The nation’s oldest male, Andrew Bolt, has today decided that he’s had enough.

Bolt, a popular columnist and commentator on the far-right media outlets, has today decided that it’s time to take action.

In a letter to The Advocate this morning, Bolt explained that the country, and the world, is going to end if we “continue down the road that the country and the world have gone on since before the First World War”.

The letter, which we published today, has caused quite a stir in the electorates of both the far right and far left of the political spectrum.

“I’m not sure how I’m going to vote,” said Andrew Bolt.

“My grandparents were pacifists. My father was a member of the Royal Society of Australia. My grandfather was a member of the Royal Society of Australia. My father was a member of the Royal Society of Australia. My mother was a member of the Royal Society of Australia. My sister was a member of the Royal Society of Australia,”

“But I’m a nationalist. I want to be part of the solution.”

Andrew Bolt’s sentiments were echoed by the Nation’s youngest male, Jack Pearson, who is currently living in exile in the Canary Island after being outed for being a member of the far-right faction of the Australian Liberal Party.

Abbott Says Showing Pass Mark In Desert Of Silence Is Not Enough, Next To Nothing

TEXT:

The current Prime Minister has thrown his support behind the far-right group, One Nation, in a recent interview with the Daily Telegraph.

Abbott says the government’s failure to pass a bill that would protect the rights of Australian indigenous people, and their children, is not the only reason he has left the Liberal Party.

“I mean, I am a former Prime Minister. I can’t help but think back to when I was in the back of the truck when Malcolm Turnbull was being interviewed by the same journalist,” he said.

“Back then, we were in a much more powerful position. We were in a position to dictate terms on how our indigenous people were going to be treated. And we did that,”

“In fact, I would have never had to do that kind of thing. I could just say, ‘I’m from the desert, I know what you’re all about. You want to take my land?’ and they’d do it. And I’m not a federal member, I’m a senator.”

Mr Abbott then went on to suggest that he might be able to explain why he left the Liberal Party, and why it wasn’t just a coincidence.

“Look, I’ve got a lot of people on this side of the political spectrum who’d love to have me back. I’m not going to stop talking about Australia’s Aboriginal history. I’m not going to start talking about climate change. Because that’s what you want to know. You want to know why I left the Liberal Party? Because Malcolm Turnbull is a coward. A real coward,”

“And I’m a strong contender for that title. So don’t bother with me, I’m leaving in a few months.”

Mr Abbott then said he had a few final words of advice for his old enemies in Canberra.

“If you want to know why I’m leaving, look at the polls. I’ve got a couple of months until the next election. If you want to know, I’m going to start speaking out against the mining companies and the banks that are wrecking the reef and polluting the seas.”

“What are you thinking?” he said, in a tone that suggested he wasn’t particularly interested in the son’s political awakening.

“My son, he’s just a kid, just like me! He’s a bit rebellious and rebellious! [laughs] You know, I love him!”

“He’s a nice kid, but. I’m looking at you, the average Australian kid.”

Our reporter spoke to a number of other local dads, who all seemed to have a similar sense of frustration and disappointment in their son’s gradual decline.

One father, who asked to remain anonymous, said that he couldn’t understand why his son was so upset with himself for being a bit ‘political.’

“I’m trying my best to teach my son to love himself, but he seems to think he’s being a realist by not letting go of the conservative strand of Australian politics,” said the father.

“I just can’t understand it. He’s a grown up now, which is so odd,”

“But, yeah, I’ve got to get him to like me. He’s still a bit of a bit radical, but he’s coming along nicely.”

Local Woman’s Weekend At The Beach Ended In A Whole Lot Of Chores

TEXT:

After a week at the beach, local woman, Sarah Adler (31) says she was feeling pretty good about herself at the time, so she thought she might treat herself to a weekend away from the hustle and bust it hustle, beachside.

“I’ve been doing the whole ‘dinner with the fishes’ thing for weeks,” says Sarah, with a smile.

“I thought I was going to go easy on the night, but it didn’t go well.”

“I ended up finishing the whole weekend at the beach, with a whole bunch of fish,”

“It was so good to see all the sea creatures again,”

“They’ve been off all weekend,”

“I’ve been feeling really good about myself lately, too,”

As Sarah points out, it’s actually quite difficult to get your head around the fact that you’ve been at the beach for the past 12 hours, without having been to the beach.

“The sun, too,” she says.

“It’s quite hard to get your head around that,”

“It’s like, the moment you leave the beach, you automatically think that you’ve been at the beach for the past 12 hours,”

“And it’s like, you just feel like you’ve been at the beach for the past 12 hours,”

“It’s like, the moment you leave the beach, you automatically think that you’ve been at the beach for the past 12 hours,”

Local Dad Not Sure If He’s Born In The Future Or In The Past

TEXT:

A local dad, who is currently sitting on a $36,000+ salary and an automatic, has this afternoon given his opinions on the state of the nation, as he watched his child play Minecraft yesterday.

Dennis, a 68-year-old retired bricklayer, says that he’s always been a bit more progressive than his kids, but that’s all part of being a grown up.

“I’m not sure if I’m born in the future or in the past,” he said.

“I’m a progressive,” he said.

“But this country is changing. The world is going to shit. I’m a proud progressive. But I don’t know if I’m a leftie or a progressive leftie. I’m just a realist.”

Dennis, who’s always been a realist, says the left wing has taken it’s turn as the only political party who actually cares about the future of this country, and that the real problem with this country is that they’ve spent too much time in office.

“When the left says the future is uncertain, what they mean is, that they don’t know what the future is, or what to do with it. That’s a real problem,” he said.

“And when they say we need to spend more money, what they mean is, that we need to spend more money on things that aren’t important to us, like paying our electric bills and internet bills.”

Dennis then told our reporter that he’d be back in the next ten minutes on the bus home to Sydney, to which he replied “not really,” as he reached for his keys.

Abbott Says He’s Never Had To Sit With The Rich Or The Poor Or The Uneducated Or The Disabled Or The Gay Or The Biased

TEXT:

Tony Abbott has told The Advocate today that he’s ‘never had to sit with the rich or the poor or the uneducated or the disabled or the gay or the biased.’

The former Prime Minister said that there’s a lot of Australians who are very similar to his current political party, and that they need to be on the same side of this political debate.

“The thing is, we are very rich. And I don’t know how I’ve been able to keep up with all the big issues that our country faces. So I’ve been trying to stay close to home and meet people who are like me, and I guess that’s what you’ve done,” he said.

“But I don’t think you’d understand. The rich don’t like me. They don’t like the right-wing or the left-wing. They don’t like my dad. They don’t like Malcolm. They don’t like me. So they are very, very angry,”

“So I guess I’ve just been trying to make things easier for them. But yeah, I’ve met some of the rich people who are very like me. My wife is Jewish and my son is Jewish.

New Study Confirms Goldie Is A Male

TEXT:

A new study by the CSIRO has confirmed that there is indeed a male Goldie out there in the wild.

The research team spent nearly a year trawling the nation’s forests for the elusive male Goldie and found over 100,000 individuals.

From Tasmania to Victoria, the research team identified over 100,000 individual individuals with male Goldie names.

“It’s a pretty rare bird, you know,” said lead researcher, Professor Alan Hurlstone.

“But, you know, we’re a bit lucky to have found this species,” he said.

“It’s a pretty cool bird. You know, we’ve been looking for this species for years and we haven’t found it yet. But, it’s just been the same as the rest of the country,”

“So, I’m glad we found it. We’ll be back next week with the female Goldie,”

“Just don’t eat all those twigs you’ve seen hanging out in the trees. They’re not good for you.”

Brisbane Man Proudly Declares He’s Been To Sydney At Some Point In His Life

TEXT:

In a brief conversation with The Advocate, young Brisbane man, Jordan Watson, revealed that he’s been to Sydney three times in his life – once as a young fella, once as a young man.

“I used to live in the Gold Coast,” he said.

“But I’ve been to Sydney three times in my life,”

“The first time was as a young fella,”

Watson, then just 23, told our reporters that he’d just moved to Sydney to attend a friend’s wedding and he’s ‘d forgotten’ where he was last time.

“I don’t know where I was last time. I was on the Gold Coast, I was young,” he said.

“But I’m not going to get my old Sydney back. I’m going to Sydney. Not just any old Sydney, not the Gold Coast. Not just any old Sydney,”

“But Sydney. The Gold Coast. Not like it’s a bit of a dump. It’s actually got some real estate. I’ve actually got a nice place here. And I’ve only got one bed. So there’s that.”

As the conversation progressed, Watson said he only had a couple of beers and he had ‘got a few more days of summer’ before he left Sydney.

Sydney Uni Grad Worried That Her Dad Will Be Not Ready For Graduation

TEXT:

Inner-city leftie Sarah Freeman (35) says she’s concerned that her dad will be not ready for graduation when she’s due to give him a c-bomb in her honour.

The recent graduate says she’s taken a job at a prominent one-person boutique law firm in the city’s leafy northern suburbs, and is unsure if she’s done enough time for her father to realise that the financial future of his career depends on his ability to pay the full HECS debt.

“I’ve been getting up at 4 am on a Tuesday morning to go to work each day” she says.

“So far, I’ve been getting paid on Friday and Saturday nights, but I’ve been getting paid on the weekend as well”

“I’ve got a 10% debt with the bank and everything. Dad said I’d be going to get my degree if I didn’t have a job at the bank”

“I’m having a look at my portfolio, it’s just not safe”

While Sarah’s dad is a bit of a risk, she says she’s confident she’ll be able to pay it off.

“It’s been a long day at work”

“I’ve got a lot of bills to pay, and I’ve been paying them off, but I’ve also been getting paid on weekends as well”

“Dad says he’s not ready for graduation, but I’m not too worried. He’s been telling me to get my GED”

Local Girl Pushing The Envelope A Bit

TEXT:

A local woman who is starting to get a bit of a reputation for being a bit of a pushover has today been referred to as a ‘dumb cunt’ by a local husband who says she doesn’t even know his wife.

It is believed that Amanda Green, a local fashion and beauty blogger, has been pushing the envelope a bit in regards to her diet and exercise regime, as she continues to look for a husband who isn’t too keen on the whole ‘getting to sleep’ thing.

“I’ve been pushing the envelope a bit,” explained Green. “I’ve been doing a bit of a paleo for the last month or so.”

“I mean, I know it’s not much, but it’s getting the job done.”

“And I’ve also been trying to lose weight, which is super easy when you just walk around the block a bit.”

“So yeah, I’ve been pushing the envelope a bit.”

“I mean, it’s hard to keep a healthy weight but it’s not hard at all.”

The Betoota Advocate caught up with Amanda after she had the results of her new diet and exercise regime, which are quite shocking.

“I’ve been doing a bit of a keto for the last month or so” she said.

“I’ve been following a strict Paleo/Primal for the past 12 weeks.”

“I’ve also been trying to lose weight. That’s super easy when you just walk around the block a bit”

Nation’s Unpaid Family Judges To Be Head Of Their Own Government Commission

TEXT:

A survey commissioned by the National Family Court (NFFC) has found that almost 90% of the nation’s un-paid family judges are ex-cons who should’ve been jailed for years for crimes against children.

The report found that up to 70% of unpaid family judges are ex-cons who should’ve been jailed for crimes against children, with up to 28% claiming to have been victims of child sexual abuse.

The findings of the survey follow a landmark report by the Senate Committee on the Judiciary into the Australian Tax Office (ATO) which recommended that the ATO should be required to pay every Australian child in the country up to $1100 every year in tax.

The recommendations were made as part of the Senate committee’s ‘road map to reform’.

The report found that the tax office is failing to meet its legal obligations, particularly regarding payment of child support and support for children under 16.

The report found that the tax office is not making enough progress towards meeting the obligations to pay every Australian child up to $1100 every year in tax, and is not making the required disclosures.

The report also found that the tax office is not meeting its obligations under the Corporations Act 1998 to establish a national tax office, or to pay a national tax office to carry out its functions.

The report found that the ATO has been pushing the tax office to make payments that are not consistent with the Tax Office’s statutory obligations.

Man Who Used To ‘Bash Poofters’ For Fun Says He’s Not Alone In His Jealousy

TEXT:

A local man who spent a big part of the eighties looking for gay men to bash at local parks says he’s not alone in his jealousy.

“It was a different world back then” says Bennet, who’s since given up his old job and is taking a job at a local council.

“It was a different culture. It was a different country”

Bennet, who now runs a local pub that caters to gay men from around town, says his jealousy is completely justified.

“I mean, I used to bash them for fun. It was a different time… I mean, it was a different world. But, you know what, it’s really hard to be jealous of these bastards now”

“They’re just so good at what they do. It’s like they’re an army of fucking pain,”

Bennet, who’s not a fan of the lifestyle he used to enjoy, says he’s really starting to feel jealous that so many of the bastards he used to bash for fun are now in the same job as him.

“It’s like, it’s like, all these fucking bastards are in the same office as me,”

“They’re so good at what they do. It’s like they’re an army of fucking pain,”

Bennet, who still regularly spends time in the pub with his mates after work, says he’s not really jealous but it definitely feels that way.

“I guess I’m just jealous they are in the same office as me. It’s like, they’re so good at what they do. It’s like they’re an army of fucking pain,”

“It’s like, they’re so good at what they do. It’s like they’re an army of fucking pain,”

Bennet, who also runs a local pet shop, says it’s hard to be jealous when you’re not jealous of anyone in the world.

“It’s like, they’re so good at what they do. It’s like they’re an army of fucking pain,”

“It’s like, they’re an army of fucking pain,”

“It’s like, they’re so good at what they do. It’s like they’re an army of fucking pain,”
